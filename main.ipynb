      "20 to 30 minutes of high intensity exercise approximately half an hour before sexual interaction has been shown to \n",

      "The pelvic floor muscles (PFM) also play a role in normal sexual function. They have the potential to increase \n",

      "videos, and Web sites just about every day. In fact, so much has changed\n",
      "since the first two editions of Fitness For Dummies were published that we felt\n",
      "compelled to overhaul the book, adding several chapters and substantially\n",
      "revamping the others.\n",
      "So what exactly is new in fitness? Health clubs are offering innovative new\n",
      "classes, like circuit training, cardio kickboxing, and firefighter boot camp, and\n",
      "nifty new machines, like the elliptical trainer. Yoga, Pilates, and other “mind-\n",
      "body” workouts have become so popular that we’ve devoted additional\n",
      "space to them. Technology has transformed fitness in many ways, too. And\n",
      "many clubs have invested in fancy entertainment systems so you can watch\n",
      "your own personal TV — or even surf the Internet — while running on the\n",

      "Of course, this being the fitness industry, the last few years have also seen\n",

      "your thighs “without any effort on your part.” And there’s no shortage of\n",
      "hokey books, Web sites full of misleading fitness information, and magazine\n",
      "ads posing as articles. We help you sort through all of that.\n",
      "About This Book\n",
      "Fitness For Dummies, 3rd Edition, updates you on all the latest — the good,\n",
      "the bad, and the totally weird. But our main mission remains the same as it\n",

      "that no matter what exercise routine you start, sooner or later you’ll end up\n",
      "back in the recliner.\n",

      "the knowledge and motivation to stick with fitness for the rest of your life.Fitness For Dummies, 3rd Edition, tells you the stuff you really want to know,\n",

      "Conventions Used in This Book\n",
      "We use few conventions in this book, because we want you to be able to pick\n",
      "it up and start anywhere. Two conventions to keep in mind are the following:\n",
      "/H12012New fitness jargon appears in italics, like this, along with a brief definition.\n",
      "Use these terms to impress your friends.\n",
      "/H12012Web sites appear in a special font, like this , to distinguish them from\n",
      "other text. Jump on over to your computer and check them out.\n",
      "We also use the terms fitness routine, workout, exercise, and activity to mean\n",
      "the same thing: whatever you’re doing to raise your heart rate, build strength,\n",
      "or both.\n",
      "Foolish Assumptions\n",
      "We make few assumptions about you, dear reader, but the first and most\n",
      "important is that you want to improve your fitness. You may be brand-new to\n",

      "accomplish. Liz has a client who was 60 years old when he started training\n",

      "muscles) and groin (inner-thigh) muscles. (See Chapter 12 for pictures of and\n",
      "more information about these muscles.) These muscles often pull because\n",

      "Why You Need to Stretch\n",
      "Stretching is the key to maintaining your flexibility — in other words, how far\n",
      "and how easily you can move your joints. As you get older, your tendons (the\n",
      "tissues that connect muscle to bone) begin to shorten and tighten, restricting\n",
      "your flexibility. Your movement becomes slower and less fluid. You don’t stand\n",
      "up as straight. You walk more stiffly and with a shorter stride. You find it more\n",
      "difficult to step up to a curb or bend down to pick up the trash. Stretching\n",
      "your rear thigh, hip, and calf muscles can make a big difference.Flexibility is one of the keys to good posture. When your front neck muscles\n",

      "are tight, your shoulders round inward. When your lower back, rear thigh,\n",
      "and hip muscles are tight, the curve of your back becomes exaggerated. A\n",

      "What’s more, flexibility exercises can correct muscle imbalances. Say that\n",
      "your front-thigh muscles are strong, but your rear thighs are tight and weak.\n",
      "(This is a common scenario.) As a result, you end up relying on your front\n",
      "thighs more than you should. Chances are, you won’t even notice this, but it\n",
      "will throw off your movement in subtle ways — you may have a short walking\n",
      "stride or bounce too high off the ground. Muscle imbalances can eventually\n",

      "In the following sections, we take a look at the different types of fat.\n",
      "Saturated fat\n",
      "Saturated fat is the really bad stuff. In excess quantities, saturated fat raises\n",
      "your levels of blood cholesterol and clogs your arteries. It’s found mostly in\n",
      "animal products, such as beef, pork, chicken, milk, ice cream, and cheese.\n",
      "But the amount of saturated fat in these foods varies greatly. For instance, \n",
      "4 ounces of roasted pork tenderloin contain only about 2 grams of saturated\n",
      "fat, compared to 12 grams of saturated fat in 4 ounces of beef ribs.\n",
      "How much saturated fat is too much? The major health organizations recom-\n",
      "mend keeping saturated fat to less than 10 percent of your total calories. If\n",
      "you eat 2,000 calories per day, that means you can get 200 of those calories\n",
      "from saturated fat. Because 1 gram of saturated fat (or fat of any kind) contains\n",
      "9 calories, you can eat about 22 grams of saturated fat per day. (By the way,\n",
      "that’s four fewer saturated fat grams than the amount in one Burger King\n",
      "Double Whopper with cheese.)88 Part II: Enjoying Total-Body Health: Eating Well and Staying Injury-Free \n",
      "Trans fats\n",
      "These artery-clogging fats may be just as harmful as saturated fats; they’re\n",
      "created through hydrogenation, a process that turns liquid oils into solids like\n",
      "margarine and shortening. Hydrogenation makes pie crusts flakier and french\n",
      "fries crispier. (Thanks to their trans fat, McDonald’s french fries have roughly\n",

      "For every ten cereals or microwave popcorn products that have trans fat,\n",

      "Unsaturated fat\n",
      "All right, now we’re getting to the fats that may actually be good for your\n",

      "Corn, soybean, safflower, and sunflower oils are mainly polyunsaturated.\n",

      "fats, but you want to eat a balance of both.\n",
      "So how much fat is it okay to eat?\n",
      "That’s debatable. Most major health organizations recommend keeping your\n",
      "total fat intake to less than 30 percent of your total calories (about 66 fat grams\n",
      "per day if you eat 2,000 calories). However, the 30 percent figure is not backed89 Chapter 7: Nutrition Basics\n",

      "your heart is jumping, and blood is pumping furiously through your muscles.\n",
      "You want your body to redirect the blood flow back to normal before you\n",

      "Weight Machines\n",
      "If you can unfold a lawn chair, you’re more than qualified to operate a weight\n",
      "machine. It all comes down to two relatively simple acts: You adjust your seat\n",
      "and then you either push or pull a bar or a set of handles. These handles are\n",
      "connected to a cable, chain, or lever, which, in turn, is attached to a stack of\n",
      "rectangular weight plates. Each plate in the stack weighs between 5 and 20\n",
      "pounds, depending on the make and model, and has a hole drilled in the center.\n",
      "If you want to lift 30 pounds, you stick a metal peg, called a pin,into the hole\n",
      "on the plate marked “30.” When you pull the machine’s handles, the cable picks\n",
      "up 30 pounds.You may also come across machines that don’t have a weight stack. Instead,\n",
      "you adjust the poundage by sliding donut-shaped weight plates onto a thick\n",
      "peg. Jargon-heads call these plate-loaded machines. The weight plates are the\n",
      "same ones used for loading up barbells. (See the “Free Weights” section later\n",
      "in this chapter for details about weight plates.) The two most popular brands\n",
      "of plate-loaded machines are Hammer Strength and CYBEX. Many plate-loaded\n",
      "machines are designed so that each arm or leg works independently of the\n",
      "other, a feature we like because it forces your weaker side to work hard.\n",
      "Weight machines have been around for more than a hundred years. Back in\n",
      "the ’60s, Arthur Jones, inventor of the Nautilus machines, created the most\n",
      "significant innovation in weight machines to date. Jones realized that when\n",
      "you lift a barbell or dumbbell, there are certain points during the exercise\n",
      "that feel very heavy and certain points that feel light. (Try a biceps curl with\n",
      "a dumbbell, and you see that the dumbbell is hardest to move when your\n",
      "forearm is parallel to the floor.) Because your muscle is only fully working at\n",
      "the instances where the weight is difficult to lift, Jones concluded, traditional\n",
      "exercises don’t give your muscles a complete workout. Then Jones realized\n",
      "that if you use a machine with a kidney-shaped pulley rather than a round\n",
      "one, your muscles feel resistance during the entire exercise and can be\n",
      "strengthened more completely.\n",
      "Most of today’s weight machines still work under the same principles that\n",
      "Jones discovered, but they have become smoother, safer, and more comfort-\n",
      "able to use. Most of the top brands, including Body Masters, CYBEX, Hammer\n",
      "Strength, Nautilus, LifeFitness, and ICARIAN do an excellent job. The brands\n",
      "generally differ in the size and shape of the pulleys; the angles of the bars,\n",
      "seats, and weight stacks; and the type of seat and handle adjustments. You\n",
      "may like the Nautilus chest press but prefer the CYBEX back machine. Try\n",
      "every machine in your gym at least once. Even if the machines are all the\n",
      "same brand, you may feel more comfortable using, say, the vertical chest\n",
      "press rather than the horizontal one.\n",
      "The weight machines designed for home use — called multi-gyms — generally\n",
      "aren’t as sophisticated as health-club machines, but in many cases, your\n",
      "muscles won’t know the difference.\n",
      "The advantages of machines\n",
      "Machines are ideal for beginners, because they’re quite safe. If you can’t\n",
      "muster the strength to finish an exercise, you don’t have to worry about\n",
      "dropping a bar on your chest. But one caveat: Don’t stick any body part near\n",
      "a weight stack that is being lifted or lowered. Liz saw a woman place her\n",
      "hand on a weight stack as she pulled out the pin. Sixty pounds of weight\n",
      "came crashing down on the woman’s palm. She was rushed to the hospital,\n",
      "where her hand was repaired with eight stitches. Liz also saw a woman with\n",
      "long hair lean over to pull out a pin before lowering the weight stack; the last192 Part IV: Lift and Curl: Building a Stronger Bod with Weights 4 inches of her hair got pressed between the weights. Fortunately, Liz and\n",
      "other staff members were able to rectify the situation without giving the\n",
      "woman a new hairstyle.\n",
      "Most machines require little coordination; they basically hold your body in\n",
      "position and guide you through the motion. Consider the shoulder-press\n",
      "machine. You simply sit in a chair and push the handles up — all your effort\n",
      "goes into lifting those handles. But if you’re shoulder pressing with a barbell\n",
      "(defined in the “Free Weights” section later in this chapter), you not only have\n",
      "to push the bar up but also have to keep it balanced and steady. Initially, your\n",
      "arms may wobble back and forth. Even after you get the hang of it, the exercise\n",
      "always requires a certain amount of balance and coordination.\n",
      "You may come across one type of machine that does require coordination.\n",
      "These “free-floating” machines look like regular weight machines, but the\n",
      "levers don’t move in a fixed pathway. You have to control the motion so the\n",
      "bar doesn’t wobble. These machines are designed to give machine users a\n",
      "free-weight feel while retaining the safety aspect of machines. But we’re not\n",
      "high on the concept. We think these machines are too complicated for begin-\n",
      "ners and not very satisfying for advanced lifters. If an experienced lifter\n",
      "wants the feel of free weights, he’ll likely prefer the real McCoy.\n",
      "Another plus for traditional machines: They’re helpful for isolating a particular\n",
      "muscle group. Isolating is just gymspeak for zeroing in on one muscle (actually,\n",
      "using a single joint in a motion) rather than getting several muscles or joints\n",
      "into the act. This is helpful if you’re trying to correct a specific weakness. For\n",
      "example, if your hamstrings (rear-thigh muscles) are underdeveloped, you can\n",
      "use a machine that holds your whole body still while you bend your legs to\n",
      "target your hamstrings. With free weights, you’ll have a harder time strengthen-\n",
      "ing your hamstrings without working your front-thigh and butt muscles, too.\n",
      "Finally, machines — at least those with weight stacks — let you get in a faster\n",
      "workout with less stopping and starting to adjust the weights. Instead of\n",
      "sliding weight plates on and off or removing free weights from the rack, you\n",
      "simply place a pin in a hole and adjust the seat. If your gym has 10 or 12\n",
      "machines grouped in a circle, square, or similar shape, you can move from\n",
      "one right to the other, exercising your whole body in less than 20 minutes.\n",
      "Typically, machines that work your larger muscle groups (chest, back, butt,\n",
      "and thighs) come before machines that work your shoulders and arms.\n",
      "The drawbacks of weight machines\n",
      "You may want to stick to machines initially, but plan to mix in some free\n",
      "weights after a month or two of working out two or three days a week.\n",
      "Machine circuits can get pretty boring — for you and your muscles. You need\n",
      "to stimulate your muscles with at least occasional changes in your workout.\n",
      "Typically, a gym has only two or three machines for each muscle group; with\n",
      "free weights, you can strengthen each muscle with dozens of exercises.193 Chapter 13: Demystifying Strength EquipmentRealize, too, that every weight machine won’t fit every body. Most machines\n",
      "are designed for people of average height, so if you’re shorter than 5'4\" or taller\n",
      "than 6'2\", you may not be able to adjust the seat to fit your body. (Figuring out\n",
      "which machines don’t fit may take you a while, however. Unlike amusement\n",
      "parks, gyms don’t post height-requirement signs.) Manufacturers have tried to\n",
      "get around the height problems by offering a variety of pads to sit on or stick\n",
      "behind you, but they don’t work for everyone. If a machine feels uncomfortable\n",
      "to you — even if you’re of average height — try another machine that targets\n",
      "the same muscle group or head for the free-weight area. As we describe in the\n",
      "“Weight machines for women” sidebar, Nautilus makes a line of machines\n",
      "scaled for women’s bodies.\n",
      "Another drawback of machines is that many of them isolate each muscle\n",
      "group. We know we said this was an advantage, but it can be a flaw. Because\n",
      "you rarely isolate your muscles in everyday life, some experts believe it\n",
      "doesn’t make sense to train them that way in the gym. If muscles become\n",
      "used to working as separate entities, the theory goes, they don’t cooperate\n",
      "with one another to the extent they should — a situation that may set you\n",
      "up for injuries.194 Part IV: Lift and Curl: Building a Stronger Bod with Weights \n",
      "Weight machines for women\n",
      "Many women don’t fit into conventional weight-\n",

      "the floor when they hop up into the seats, or\n",
      "their arms are too short to reach the bar they’re\n",
      "supposed to grab.\n",
      "About ten years ago, Nautilus recognized\n",
      "these problems and designed weight-training\n",

      "smaller women have the most trouble using.\n",
      "In addition to downsizing the frames, Nautilus\n",
      "researchers studied the way women lift weights.\n",
      "They found that, like men, women are stronger atcertain points in an exercise and weaker at other\n",
      "points; however, they also discovered that for\n",
      "men and women these points are not the same.\n",
      "So, they set up the machines’ pulleys differently\n",
      "from conventional machines to give women a\n",

      "Military Academy (USMA) Department of Physical Education  for his work in assisting us in this \n",
      "project.   He graciously allowed us to edit his work on cardio -respiratory training in order to \n",
      "tailor it towards ROTC cadets who have varying fitness needs at over 270 schools.  Cadet \n",
      "Command would not have been succe ssful in writing this Fitness Handbook without his help and \n",

      " It is imperative that cadets learn an easy way to reduce the likelihood o f injury while \n",
      "using this Fitness Handbook.  Cadets need to recognize that they have an increased risk of lower \n",
      "body injuries than upper body injuries during summer training events.  The leading causes of this \n",
      "are improperly sized or poorly broken -in boots  and inadequate running shoes.  Boots that hurt or \n",
      "uncomfortable to you at school will cause significantly more discomfort and increase the chance \n",
      "of injury during rigorous summer training events like the National Advanced Leadership Camp, \n",
      "Airborne School or Air Assault School.  A broken in pair of boots should feel as comfortable as \n",
      "your most comfortable pair of shoes.  To put it simply, you should be able to walk or run in them \n",
      "comfortably.  \n",
      " \n",
      " Similarly running shoes should fit comfortably and not show sig nificant tread wear.  \n",
      "Running places different wear on your shoes than walking does.  Using shoes you walk in for \n",
      "running can place undo stress on your lower body.  This stress can increase the risk of injury.   \n",
      "Field Manual 21 -20 divides running shoes int o three categories.  Select an impact control shoe if \n",
      "you have high arches or notice that your running shoes tend to wear unevenly on the outside \n",
      "edge.  Select a motion control shoe if you have flat feet or notice that excessive wear on both the \n",
      "extreme ou tside and inside of the sole of the running shoe.  Select a balanced shoe if you have \n",
      "normal arches or only see wear on the outside sole beneath the ankle.  \n",
      " \n",
      " Other factors that reduce the likelihood of injuries include adequate warm -ups prior to \n",
      "high inten sity exercise, proper nutrition and hydration, maintaining recovery periods following \n",
      "exercise, and cool -down periods concluding the exercise.  \n",

      "Physical Fitness  \n",
      " \n",
      "TRAINING VARIABLE S \n",
      " \n",
      "Before explaining what a physical fitness program should look like, there are some basic \n",
      "terms that must be discussed. These principals apply to all programs in general and must be \n",
      "addressed in the development of any fitness program.  \n",
      " \n",
      " INTENSITY – The a mount of effort put into each workout, usually measured by \n",
      "heartbeats per minute. For the maximum benefit in each workout, plan on exercising at a \n",
      "minimum of 70 percent of the heart rate reserve. There are several scientific ways to your heart \n",
      "rate reserve . The simplest way is to begin with you maximum heart rate (220 -Age).  Next, \n",
      "measure your resting heart rate.  The heart rate reserve is found by Max heart rate - resting heart \n",
      "rate.  To train at 70% of the heart rate reserve you would multiply 70% by the heart rate reserve \n",
      "and then add your resting heart rate.  For a 20 year old with a resting heart rate of 60 to \n",
      "dDetermin eing your training heart rate in beats per minute would be 70% x Heart Rate Reserve \n",
      "=.70 x (200 -60) + 60 (Resting Heart Rate ) = a traini ng heart rate of 158 beats per min.  \n",
      " \n",
      " DURATION – The length each exercise period should last. There has been a great deal of \n",
      "research on this topic. Most experts believe that when working on your cardiovascular endurance \n",
      "a minimum of 20 to 30 minutes is ne eded to obtain maximum benefit. This holds true for the \n",
      "majority of the population. The only notable exception occurs for long distance or endurance \n",
      "athletes (e.g. marathon runners or triathletes ).  \n",
      " \n",
      " FREQUENCY – The number of workouts one should have per week.  Once again experts \n",
      "agree that the average person requires a minimum of three workouts per week to improve their \n",
      "current level of fitness. Working out less frequently will only maintain a level of fitness; it will \n",
      "not improve the level of fitness.  W hen exercising only three times a week, each period should be \n",
      "medium to high intensity. Exercising with consistent frequency can also be referred to as \n",
      "REGULARITY. Exercise must be done regularly to produce a training effect. Sporadic exercise \n",
      "may cause mo re harm in the form of injury than benefit from exercise.   The same is true for \n",
      "extremely intense workouts.  They may create injuries.  \n",
      " \n",
      " RECOVERY – Do not work the same muscle groups hard day after day . Muscles \n",
      "need recovery time. People frequently misund erstand this point.  Providing inadequate recovery \n",
      "can explain the reason why most people see little or no gain from excessive exercise. You can \n",
      "work the same muscle groups each day, however, you should work hard one day and easy the \n",
      "next. This is a critic al point because this fitness program is based on a six days a week exercise \n",
      "program.  \n",
      " \n",
      " GENERAL ADAPTATION PRINCIPAL (GAP) – Muscles as well as your \n",
      "cardiovascular system in the body will adapt to the increasing stress placed upon it through \n",
      "exercise.  To see gains in a fitness program one must stress the existing muscular and \n",
      "cardiovascular systems. This can also be called the OVERLOAD principal. For a muscle to \n",
      "increase in strength, the workload during exercise must be larger than what it normally \n",
      "experie nces.  \n",
      "  5  SPECIFICITY – There are several different exercises and events that can develop your \n",
      "muscular strength as well as cardiovascular fitness. To increase the number of push -ups you can \n",
      "do, simply increase upper body strength through a number of streng th exercises and weights. \n",
      "However, the best way to improve push -ups requires doing push -ups.  Similarly one can improve \n",
      "cardiovascular fitness by biking swimming, or walking.  However, if the goal remains an \n",
      "improved ability to run, the best exercise will be running.  \n",
      " \n",
      "MAJOR COMPONENTS OF PHYSICAL FITNESS – There are several components of \n",
      "any fitness program. The three major components of most programs are flexibility, strength, \n",
      "muscular endurance,  and cardiovascular endurance . These components are the essen tial \n",
      "elements of the Army Physical Fitness Program.  \n",
      " \n",
      "How to Use These Workout Programs  \n",
      " \n",

      "These are not good odds!  It's now widely accepted that the problem has nothing to do with the person but rather with the process.  You see, most people who want to start exercising just start.  Imagine if you wanted to build a house.  You'd start out with an architectural plan first to know exactly what you wanted your house to look like.  Or what if you wanted to start a business?  The banks would require a business plan first, right?  They'd want to ensure that you've really thought it through carefully and you've got a good plan to enhance success.  Well, these same guidelines apply to exercise.  You've got to have a plan for success.  This is why the first few months of \n",
      "your fitness experience are so important.  This is when most people drop out.  So at NW Women’s Fitness Club \n",
      "we focus on getting you past this stage to the point where you’re experiencing great results – and that alone, will help to motivate you to keep going.  The problem is most people stop exercising before they even had the chance to see the changes to their body.  We just won’t let that happen to you! \n",
      " \n",
      "After working with various clients for a number of years, we've noticed a  number of characteristics that   separate those who succeed with their fitness program from those who do not.  Those who succeed buy into the \"Four Laws of Success\".  You must be ready to accept these laws without exception. \n",
      " \n",
      "First Law – THE LAW OF POSSESSION.   \n",
      "You need to understand that if you are going to achieve results, it is going to be up to you.  The phrases \"If it’s \n",
      "going to be, it’s up to me\" or \"If I think I can or think I can't, I'm right,\" ring very true.  You have to take ultimate responsibility for success or failure.  Sometimes clients believe their trainer is going to be the one who makes it happen for them.  At Northwest Personal Training, we set them straight right away. All we can do is educate and guide.  Our clients must be willing to make and stick to the changes.  You cannot completely rely on someone else (like a personal trainer or workout partner) to make it happen for you and likewise, you cannot \n",
      "blame the kids or your partner for any failures.   \n",
      " \n",
      "Second Law – THE LAW OF EFFORT.   \n",
      "Anything worth achieving is worth working for.  Exercise and healthy eating takes discipline, will power,     \n",
      "character, persistence, and a commitment to delayed gratification.   \n",
      " \n",
      "Third Law – THE LAW OF CONSISTENCY.   \n",
      "A month-long effort is not going to get you where you want.  In order to achieve any goal, you must stick to \n",
      "your game plan for the long-term.  Getting off track for a week is no big deal if you are consistent in your efforts, but if you are regularly tempted away from your program, you will not succeed.  Consistency and persistency are the keys to manifesting any goal.  Remember that if you want to be 10 pounds thinner 10 years from now, it is not what you do over the next eight weeks that matters. It is what you do over the next 10 years! All the changes we will suggest must be followed for the rest of your life - so of course, we are going to make room for indulgences.  The program has got to be realistic if you're going to stick to it.  There are no short-term, quick fix solutions.  Researchers have found only one characteristic common to those who succeed with \n",

      "ending improvement.  In practical terms, it means that regardless of anything else – busy work schedules, lack of energy, lack of time, feeling old, feeling lazy, hating exercise – they make no excuses!  They keep exercising, taking their long-term goals and splitting them up into smaller goals.  They take it one day at a time.   \n",

      "yourself.  It's all about \"Results Momentum\" - achieving one result gives you the confidence to achieve the next goal.  Each time a promise is broken, however, your self-esteem goes down, making it easier to break the next promise.  Reinforce this belief in yourself by surrounding yourself with others who are doing or have accomplished what you're attempting.  After all, if they can do it, so can you!

      "   \n",
      "Aerobic exercise  is exercise that demands a level of oxygen intake that your body is able to supply (for \n",
      "extended periods).  It involves activities such as going out for a walk, jog, cycle, swim, or taking a \n",
      "fitness class.  It is exercise that is within your comfort zone and at an intensity that you could hold for 20 \n",
      "minutes plus.  This type of exercise will condition your heart and achieve the benefits listed above.  \n",
      "Anaerobic exercise  is exercise that demands a level of oxygen intake that your body is unable to \n",
      "adequately supply (for extended periods).  It is a more challenging form of exercise.  It involves the \n",
      "same activities as above but at a much harder intensity.  For example, it would involve going for a jog \n",
      "and then for 30 seconds picking up the pace and sprinting.  Then you would return back to an easier \n",
      "intensity at the end of the 30 second sprint.  You could do this at regular intervals during a running, \n",
      "cycling, swimming, or walking workout.  This kind of workout will help you get fit fast.  It raises what \n",
      "is called your \"anaerobic threshold\".  This threshold point is the feeling you'll experience during an \n",
      "activity session when you're pushing hard, perhaps a bit too hard, and you start to breathe really heavy \n",
      "and your heart is pounding fast and if you maintain this intensity for too long, you might start to feel \n",
      "nauseous and dizzy.  This is one of the side effects of lactic acid - a toxic by-product of high intensity \n",
      "exercise.  When you perform anaerobic intervals as listed above, you only hold this pace for 30 seconds \n",
      "to two minutes, and just before you're about to start experiencing some of those nasty side effects of high \n",
      "intensity exercise, you drop the pace again and allow your body to recover.  By doing these brief, high-\n",
      "intensity intervals your body starts to get used to the intensity and is better able to handle the lactic acid, \n",
      "flush it out of the tissues and actually use the lactic acid for energy.  So by doing these anaerobic \n",
      "intervals, you will get fit fast and you'll start to notice that intensities that used to get you huffing and \n",

      "calories per minute and help you achieve any fat loss goals you may have. \n",

      "Just a note - Wait a few months before graduating to high-intensity exercise if you are a beginner.  Of \n",
      "course, the faster you walk, step, dance, cycle, or run, the more calories you use per minute.  However, if \n",
      "you have been sedentary, high-intensity exercise compromises the ability to sustain exercise for a long \n",
      "time.  For that reason, lower-intensity exercise is more effective in the initial stages of training and is a \n",

      " Foundational Resistance Training Principles: \n",
      " \n",
      "Quality and execution of movement is critical.  It makes no sense to perform 20 sloppy reps.  It is far \n",
      "better to perform 8 reps with perfect form and then take a break.  Proper execution of each rep is the most \n",
      "critical factor in weight training.  Reps performed with poor technique will cause slower progress and \n",
      "may put you at risk for injury.  \n",
      " \n",
      "Take it slow.  Proper resistance training is not a fast sport. In fact Wayne Westcott, a leading Strength \n",
      "and Conditioning researcher, has determined that one repetition should take approximately 5-6 seconds; 42 that is 2 seconds to lift the weight and 4 seconds to slowly lower the weight in a controlled fashion.  \n",
      "Most people lift much too quickly using momentum instead of muscle.  A proper set of 8-12 repetitions \n",
      "should take approximately 1 minute to complete.  As you advance in your program, your trainer may \n",
      "incorporate speed and power training but it is typically done without heavy resistance and with tools \n",
      "that are more conducive to faster movements (medicine balls, body weight only training, exercise tubing \n",
      "etc). \n",
      " \n",
      "Breathe.  A proper breathing rhythm will make each set more effective.  Focus on exhaling as you lift \n",
      "the weight or when you exert and inhale as you recover or lower the weight. \n",
      " \n",
      "Sit up straight.  Proper posture is critical to ensure you are working the correct muscle groups and not \n",
      "putting your body at risk for injury.  Always keep your abdominals contracted throughout the entire set \n",
      "of any exercise.  Pull them up and in towards your spine to help stabilize your trunk.  Keep your \n",
      "shoulders back and chest lifted up and out on any seated, bent over or standing exercise. \n",
      "A good exercise set will finish once you hit momentary muscle fatigue .  This is the point during which \n",
      "you absolutely cannot do another rep with perfect form.  If you can perform more reps, you should \n",
      "either perform the extra reps to hit momentary muscle fatigue or next time, increase the resistance so \n",
      "you can hit momentary muscle fatigue within the suggested repetition zone of 8-12 reps. \n",
      "   \n",
      "Never go to failure.  Failure is when you continue the set with poor technique or when other muscle \n",
      "groups have kicked in to help finish the set.  It is important that you always avoid poor technique and \n",
      "muscle substitution. \n",
      " \n",
      "If you cannot perform 8 reps, the weight is typically too heavy.  If you can perform 12 reps with perfect \n",
      "technique, increase the weight by 5%. \n",
      " \n",
      "Perform your muscle-conditioning sessions on alternating days .  You may be surprised to learn that \n",
      "you don’t get stronger when you weight train.  You actually get stronger during the rest periods in \n",
      "between your workouts.  At a cellular level, when you weight train, your muscles experience \n",

      "For the upper body, exercises like Chin ups, Rows, Bench Press and Push-ups are compound \n",
      "movements.  These types of movements are important because they train the body in a fashion that is \n",
      "similar to how we actually move in every day life.  For example, every time you get out of a chair - \n",

      "mini-bends into squats and lunges and progress into the deeper lunges and squats once you learn \n",
      "proper knee tracking and alignment and your muscles get strong enough to handle the deeper load. \n",

      "sugar from the bloodstream and maintain normal levels.\n",
      "Research, including a study at the University of\n",
      "Washington School of Medicine, has found that exercise—\n",
      "particularly strength training—increases insulin sensitivity\n",
      "in the muscles. So if you’ve just worked out, more of thecarbs you eat afterward will be carried by insulin directly\n",
      "to your muscles for replenishment. (Incidentally, this goes\n",
      "for protein too, which is why it’s helpful to consume a\n",
      "mixture of protein and carbs after training—we’ll discuss\n",
      "this more later.) On the other hand, if you’ve been sitting\n",
      "on the couch watching football, those carbs will just get\n",

      "For this reason, we recommend that most of your carbs\n",
      "come before, during, and shortly after training. It also\n",

We’re busy ladies, so if we can get more bang for our buck with quick workouts, sign us up! Here, we share a four-minute thigh routine you can do daily. But don’t be fooled — just because it’s short doesn’t mean it should be easy. Quality is better than quantity, so focus on form, add a dumbbell if bodyweight is a bit too easy, and get to work. 1. Side squatsSquats are a girl’s best friend — they work your legs and your booty. Add in the side step and you’ll feel an extra burn in your thighs and hips. Equipment needed: a small dumbbell or weight if you need a challenge Stand up straight with your legs shoulder-width apart and arms at your side (or holding a weight to your chest). Step to the right, and as you do so, sit back into a squat, raising your arms to a comfortable position in front of you if just using your bodyweight.Rise and return to standing in center. Repeat on the left side.Complete 1 round for 1 minute. 2. Plié leg liftIf you’ve ever done ballet, you know it’s killer on the thighs — that’s why we stole this dance-inspired move from a barre workout!Equipment needed: noneStart in a plié squat position, hands on your sides. Toes should be pointed out, feet wider than shoulder-width apart and knees slightly bent.Squat down, pushing you hips back, and on your way up, lift the right leg up into the air at your side. Go as high as is comfortable. Safely return to the starting position. Repeat the same steps, raising the left leg. Complete 1 round for 1 minute.3. Single-leg bridgeNo thigh-toning routine is complete without a bridge, which strengthens your hamstrings, glutes, and core. To get the most out of this exercise, squeeze your cheeks when you reach the top, really forming a mind-body connection.Equipment needed: a mat, plus a small dumbbell or weight if you need a challenge Start lying face up on a mat, knees bent with feet on the floor and palms facing down at your sides.Lift your right leg up off the ground and straighten it out in front of you while your left leg stays bent.Pressing your left heel into the floor, lift your pelvis up toward the ceiling, squeezing at the top when you reach a stiff bridge position. Slowly lower back down to the ground and repeat for 30 seconds. Switch legs, and complete 30 seconds with the left leg up to round out this exercise. 4. Scissor planks By this point you should be getting a little tired, but the scissor plank will challenge you until the end! Equipment needed: hardwood floor, towel or slider for each footStart in a plank position with towels or sliders positioned under each toe. Bracing your core and upper body, slowly drag your feet apart as wide as they’ll go. Pause, then pull them back to center using your thigh muscles. Keep your hips square to the ground and your core tight.Complete 2 rounds of 30 seconds each.Takeaway Find a way to work this routine into your daily schedule and commit to push harder each time.

      "Knowing where to start is a challenge if you're a new exerciser or trying to get back into exercise. The best workout schedule for you will depend on various factors like your age, fitness level, goals, and any physical restrictions you may have.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Having a properly planned workout schedule will provide structure to your workouts and ensure you incorporate strategies that help you see the results you want. Workout plans also help you know exactly what to do so you aren't left guessing.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Depending on your goals, a workout schedule will likely include resistance training, cardiovascular exercise, active rest, and flexibility or mobility work. Some of these workouts can be combined or done on separate days. Active rest is essential on the days you are not completing more intense training.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "   Types of Exercise You Need  \n",
      "\n",
      "Whether your goal is to lose weight, improve your health, get in better shape, or all of the above, there are three main components to a good exercise program:\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Cardio exercise: Cardio can be any activity that gets your heart rate up, from walking or jogging to cycling or taking a fitness class. Regardless of the exercise, it is always smart to warm up with 5 to 10 minutes of light cardio.\n",
      "Weight training: You don't have to lift heavy weights or even spend a lot of time on weight training at first, but you do need to lift. Your muscles will get stronger, helping with daily functioning, and more muscle mass will boost your metabolism.\n",
      "Flexibility training: You also need to have the flexibility to go through a full range of motion for each exercise you do. Stretching increases your flexibility and helps your body recover after exercise. While some people like to set aside a day to focus on flexibility, you don't need a separate workout for this—stretching should be included in every workout.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",

      "Be sure to rest and recover. You may need extra recovery days to allow your body to rest and heal. It's normal to be sore when you try new activities, but if you can't move the next day, that means you overdid it and may need to back off your next workout.\n",
      "Make it work for you. A typical beginner program will include two to three days of cardio and two days of strength training. You can also combine these workouts if you do not have five days to devote to exercise.\n",
      "Learn how to monitor your intensity. Most beginners will start working out at a moderate intensity. That means you're at about a Level 5 on the perceived exertion scale. Or you can use the talk test: If you can carry on a somewhat breathy conversation while you're working out, that's usually a moderate intensity. \n",

      "You can do cardio and weight training on the same day. It is best to do the workout that best matches your goals first. If your goal is to improve muscular strength or size, perform your strength training routine first. If your goal is to work on cardiovascular health, do cardio first.
