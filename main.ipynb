      "[Document(page_content='EXERCISE & Women’s Health\\n\\nAn eBook by\\n\\nFOREWORD\\n\\nESME SOAN\\n\\nFrom puberty to pregnancy, menarche to menopause, exercise is a form of medicine and a hugely important modality to support women’s health. One in two women in Australia are not sufficiently physically active, a statistic that is contributing to the rates of chronic disease burden for women.\\n\\n‘Women’s Health’ is an umbrella term, used to describe all manner of health conditions and life stages for women, from puberty, pregnancy, postpartum and menopause. Through each of these life stages, exercise has an important therapeutic application for preventative health. Exercise really is a form of medicine – research has shown that it begins even before birth! In utero, exposures to physical activity can even change phenotype expressions for children of exercising mums, showing that exercise in pregnancy has both short and long term positive health effects for mum and child!\\n\\nExercising right through menopause can help with hot flushes, and reduce the risk of osteoporosis. Exercising right postnatally can help strengthen your pelvic floor and core and reduce your risk of incontinence or prolapse.\\n\\nAs fantastic as we know exercise can be for overall health indicators, barriers to women being active can be many and varied; from chronic pain, injury and incontinence, to childcare commitments, stigma and low self-esteem to exercise or participate in sport. With the assistance of an Accredited Exercise Physiologist (AEP) to help get women active, not only will her own health outcomes improve, but it will influence the health of the whole family.\\n\\nAccredited Exercise Physiologists have so much to offer to the women’s health scope of practice, helping women address the many barriers, whether mental, physical or societal, to being physically active. This eBook offers an insight to the many different health conditions that fall under the women’s health umbrella that can be improved with the use of exercise as medicine, and the important role an Accredited Exercise Physiologist can play in helping women remain healthy and physically active.\\n\\nSo no matter your age, or prior experience, or injuries or abilities, add movement to your life ladies!\\n\\nEsme Soan is an Accredited Exercise Physiologist at Pear Exercise Physiology: Pregnancy & Women’s Health in Brisbane, and Women’s Health Expert with ESSA. When not working as a clinician, she teaches multidisciplinary practice with The Women’s Health Collective.\\n\\n2\\n\\nANITA HOBSON-POWELL\\n\\nWomen in Australia are undertaking a wide range of roles every day, whether they be teachers, first responders, chefs, mothers, grandmothers, office workers, tradeswomen, and many more. As a busy mum and executive officer, I know first-hand how much of a struggle it can be to put my health first.\\n\\nThroughout my life I’ve had my ups and downs, but I have always found that exercise helps bring out the best in me, and my family. I have learnt that it’s important to make time in our busy schedules for some form of physical activity. It’s an evidence-based treatment for both my physical and mental health, and provides the opportune moment for ‘me time’.\\n\\nThis eBook outlines the variety of roles exercise plays for our overall health, with contributions from a range of women who are dedicated to the world of exercise and women’s health. It also identifies the need to seek advice from the right exercise practitioners, such as Accredited Exercise Physiologists, when making the decision to implement exercise and physical activity in to our daily lives for positive lifestyle changes.\\n\\nAt ESSA, our membership base and National Board is currently 50% women, and it’s important for ESSA to continue encouraging women to look after their physical and mental health through the significant benefits of exercise.\\n\\nAnita Hobson-Powell is the Chief Executive Officer of Exercise & Sports Science Australia (ESSA).\\n\\n3\\n\\nWHO IS ESSA?\\n\\nFounded in 1991, Exercise & Sports Science Australia (ESSA) is the peak professional body and accrediting authority for over 7,000 university qualified and Accredited Exercise Physiologists, Exercise Scientists, Sports Scientists, and High Performance Managers.\\n\\nFind your local accredited exercise professional: www.essa.org.au/find-aep/\\n\\nA Locked Bag 4102, Ascot QLD 4007 P 07 3171 3335 F 07 3318 7666 E info@essa.org.au W www.essa.org.au\\n\\n20/12/2018\\n\\nPublisher: Camella Brightman Designer: Leigh McLennan\\n\\nThank you to the ESSA accredited professionals who contributed their time and expert knowledge to this eBook.\\n\\n4\\n\\nCONTENTS\\n\\nForeword - Esme Soan Foreword - Anita Hobson-Powell Who is ESSA?

Women also experience post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) and eating disorders at higher rates than men.\\n\\n6 IN 10 AUSTRALIAN WOMEN ARE OVERWEIGHT OR OBESE.\\n\\nExcess body weight, known as overweight and obesity, is a risk factor for many conditions, including cardiovascular disease, high blood pressure, type 2 diabetes, sleep apnoea and osteoarthritis.\\n\\nIn 2014–15, almost 6 in 10 women in Australia (56%) were overweight or obese.\\n\\nWOMEN AND PREGNANCY\\n\\nWomen are giving birth later in life. The average age of all women who give birth continues to rise. It was 30 in 2016, compared with 29 in 2006.\\n\\n12% of women who gave birth in 2016 had gestational diabetes.\\n\\nAlmost 1 in 2 mothers were overweight or obese at their first antenatal visit. Obesity in pregnancy contributes to increased risks of illness and death for both mother and baby. Pregnant women who are obese have an increased risk of thromboembolism, gestational diabetes, pre-eclampsia, post-partum haemorrhage (bleeding), and wound infections.\\n\\nBURDEN OF DISEASE\\n\\nWomen experience a greater proportion of the total disease burden from blood and metabolic disorders (59%), neurological conditions (58%) and musculoskeletal conditions (55%). Nearly half (44%) of the burden of disease in women is from cancer, musculoskeletal conditions, and cardiovascular disease.\\n\\nThe leading cause of death was coronary heart disease, followed by dementia and Alzheimer disease, and cerebrovascular disease. Females were almost twice as likely to die from dementia and Alzheimer disease as males, accounting for 65% of all deaths from dementia and Alzheimer disease.\\n\\n7\\n\\nWHY IS EXERCISE IMPORTANT FOR WOMEN?\\n\\nThe great news is, that although 56% of Australian men and women are not participating in sufficient physical activity, 1 in 2 Australian women aged 18–64 are getting enough exercise.\\n\\nIn 2014–15, 46% of women aged 18–64 exercised sufficiently (completing at least 150 minutes of physical activity over 5 or more sessions each week).\\n\\n46%\\n\\n18-64\\n\\nyears of age\\n\\nmins/week\\n\\n150\\n\\nExercise rates were highest among women aged 25–34 (51%) and lowest among women aged 55–64 (41%).\\n\\n25-34 years of age\\n\\n51%\\n\\n55-64 years of age\\n\\n41%\\n\\n1 in 4 (23%) women aged 65 and over were sufficiently active (completing at least 30 minutes of exercise on most days each week).\\n\\n65+\\n\\n30mins most days/wk\\n\\n8\\n\\nPROTECT YOUR MENTAL HEALTH\\n\\nThe link between regular physical activity and positive mental health for women has been well documented. Exercise helps to both manage many mental health conditions, such as depression and anxiety, and has a positive effect on mood and overall mental health.\\n\\nSUPPORT AGEING\\n\\nAs women age, exercise becomes even more crucial for maintaining health and movement. Half of all Australian women over 60 will suffer a fracture related to osteoporosis. Weight bearing exercise can help to improve bone health and reduce the risk of fractures.\\n\\nPREVENT CHRONIC CONDITIONS\\n\\nHalf of Australian women are affected by at least one of eight major chronic diseases. Exercise can help to reduce the risk of developing a range of chronic conditions, including cardiovascular disease, breast cancer and diabetes.\\n\\nRegular exercise not only improves your physical and mental health, but it reduces your risk of chronic disease and premature death. This means you’ll be happier, healthier and around for longer to spend quality time with your loved ones.\\n\\n9\\n\\nHOW MUCH SHOULD YOU EXERCISE?\\n\\nIn line with Australian physical activity recommendations, it’s recommended that women undertake 150 to 300 minutes (2 ½ to 5 hours) of moderate activity or 75 to 150 minutes (1 ¼ to 2 ½ hours) of vigorous intensity physical activity each week. This can include:\\n\\n» biking » walking » swimming » jogging\\n\\nIt’s also recommended to fit in at least two strength sessions every week, and limit long periods of sitting.\\n\\nUnderstanding exercise intensity is important. A quick way to test your exercise intensity is using the talk test. When exercising can you:\\n\\n» Talk comfortably and sing comfortably? You’re probably exercising at a light intensity. » Talk comfortably but not sing? This is likely to be moderate intensity exercise. » Neither talk nor sing comfortably? You’re working hard at a vigorous/high intensity.\\n\\nConsistency is key – try to be physically active on most, if not ALL days.\\n\\nFor beginners: start with 10 minutes of light activity, slowly boosting exercise intensity as it becomes easier.\\n\\n10\\n\\nWHO ARE THE EXERCISE PROFESSIONALS?\\n\\nAccredited Exercise Physiologists (AEP) are qualified allied health professionals that hold a minimum of 4-years of university training. AEPs are equipped to design, deliver and evaluate safe and effective evidence-based exercise interventions to individuals at high risk of developing, or with existing, chronic and complex conditions and injuries, including any conditions for which there is evidence that exercise can improve the client’s clinical status.\\n\\nBy speaking with an Accredited Exercise Physiologist who works and specialises in women’s health, they can provide you with a program suitably tailored to your own level of fitness, and assist you with your health or any medical conditions or injuries you may have.\\n\\nTo get in contact with your local accredited exercise professional, visit the ESSA website: www.essa.org.au or speak with your GP for a referral to an Accredited Exercise Physiologist.\\n\\n11\\n\\nEXERCISING FOR SAFE WEIGHT LOSS\\n\\nIn 2011-12, over 2.3 million Australians aged 15 years and over reported to be on a diet to help lose weight or for another health reason. A majority of these Australians were women. Unfortunately, women are also more likely than men to have higher rates of body dissatisfaction, poor body image, engage in riskier health behaviours such as extreme dieting and purging, and report depression and anxiety associated with their weight.\\n\\nWe have become a society obsessed with losing weight through extreme measures, fad diets and magic pills, which may be why a majority of weight loss efforts fail long term. Due to these extreme measures, exercise is not typically recommended, yet, exercise has been shown to play a crucial role not only with weight loss but for our overall physical and mental health. Regular physical activity is important for the prevention of chronic diseases, such as cancers and diabetes, and assists with the management of anxiety and depression. Let’s take a closer look on how to make exercise and weight loss a positive experience.\\n\\nYour mindset towards exercise or physical activity is a great determinant towards your success or failure with weight loss. If you consistently see exercise as difficult or as a punishment, then you’re not likely to stick to a plan, and who would if you say you hated it. If you’re a self-confessed non-exerciser, rather than feeling confined to traditional forms of exercise, such as walking/running, the gym or swimming, try other forms! Dancing, horse riding or stand up paddle boarding all require some sort of physical exertion and can be extremely fun. Go out and try something new, you may even make some great workout friends along the way, which will help your weight loss even further!\\n\\nOther ways to improve your relationship towards exercise can be focusing on the positives you receive from it, such as increased moods, confidence, energy, and strength, as well as lowering your risk for chronic diseases. If you’re still finding it difficult to stick to your new exercise plan, see my top 10 tips for some extra help.\\n\\n12\\n\\nTOP 10 TIPS\\n\\n1. Ask yourself why. If you’ve ever tried to lose weight before there usually comes a moment in time when you ask yourself why you’re doing this. So why is losing weight important to you? What will you be able to do once you lose weight? Is it to have more energy to play with your kids, buy an outfit in a particular shop, or climb stairs without getting puffed? Finding your why will enable you to stick to your plan when the going gets tough.\\n\\n2. Set small, incremental goals. Sometimes we get overwhelmed by the weight we’d like to lose so it’s always\\n\\nrecommended to break down the goal into smaller amounts. Particularly as the recommended weight loss is 0.5-1kg maximum per week.\\n\\n3. Track your progress. Weight loss progress can seem slow so it’s recommended to take as many measurements as you can to help you stay on track. Many people tend to only use their weight on a scale but you should also take body measurements, photos and perform a fitness test.\\n\\n4. Keep a food and fitness diary. Many weight loss studies have shown that when people track their food and physical activity throughout the day or week it resulted in higher and more sustainable weight loss. This was thought to be due to a greater awareness.\\n\\n5. Recruit friends and family. Let’s face it, exercise can be tough, but when you do it with other people it has been\\n\\nshown to increase adherence as no one wants to be the one that cancels.\\n\\n6. Use incentives. Incentives are a great way to stay on track as you reach milestones. They can range from\\n\\nscheduling a massage, buying a new outfit, or even new exercise gear.\\n\\n7. Progress not perfection. When you’re first starting out, you can get caught up in trying to do everything\\n\\nperfectly, but sometimes this isn’t sustainable. Instead, focus on positive changes you’ve made; did you cut out your soft drink habit or are you taking the stairs rather than the lift? All of these positive health behaviours will help you reach your goal.\\n\\n8. Plan for failure. Let’s face it, life happens, and when it does it’s best to be prepared. Put out your clothes the\\n\\nnight before, pack a healthy lunch, and schedule in your exercise time so you can plan out your week.\\n\\n9. Action, action, action! Unless you actually move your body you won’t receive the great rewards. Any type of\\n\\nphysical activity will help get you to your goal. So if you didn’t make it to the gym today, ask yourself what other activities you can do. Make sure you get up every 1-2 hours and walk around for 5 minutes, take the stairs, park further away, or set a goal of doing 100 squats off your chair throughout the day. Every bit counts!\\n\\n10. Seek out the professionals for help. Speak to an exercise professional such as an Accredited Exercise\\n\\nPhysiologist on how to kick start your exercise goals. Not only can they provide motivation but they are the experts of exercise and can tailor a plan specific to you making you more likely to stick to it.\\n\\nExpert Contributor: Phoebe Roberts, Accredited Exercise Physiologist\\n\\n13\\n\\nEXERCISING FOR BREAST CANCER\\n\\nThe diagnosis of breast cancer brings challenges, lots of emotions, time off work, a new routine and a range of side effects. The last component of treatment that an individual is likely to consider is regular exercise, however exercise is an integral part of management of breast cancer during and after treatments have ended.\\n\\nIn 2018, COSA, the Clinical Oncology Society of Australia, called for exercise to be embedded as part of standard practice in cancer care and to be viewed as an adjunct therapy that helps counteract the adverse effects of cancer and its treatment. Best practice cancer care also included referral to an exercise professional with experience in cancer care, such as an Accredited Exercise Physiologist.\\n\\nRegular physical activity will assist with:\\n\\n» Maintenance of lean muscle mass » Maintenance of Bone Mineral Density (BMD) » Manage and reduce cancer-related fatigue » Improved mood » Maintaining aerobic conditioning » Manage flexibility and mobility, especially after surgery and reconstructive surgeries » Improve appetite and reduce nausea (a common side effect of chemotherapy) » Enhanced outcomes during and post-treatment » Reduction in overall side effects experienced » Improved sense of being connected and social interaction\\n\\nHOW MUCH EXERCISE?\\n\\nThe amount and duration of exercise will depend on the individual, their treatment and ability to engage in regular physical activity. Just remember, something is better than nothing.\\n\\nOverall, the general guidelines for individuals with breast cancer are to engage in 30 minutes of exercise on most (5+) days per week. This can be accumulated in 10 minute blocks throughout the day. The intensity of the exercise is recommended to be moderate. This means a slight increase in breathing rate, heart rate and body temperature.\\n\\nYou will still be able to maintain a conversation with a friend though!\\n\\n14\\n\\nWHAT TYPE OF EXERCISE?\\n\\nFirstly, find something that you enjoy. Use this time as your time away from all the medical appointments, scans, results and waiting rooms! Any type of exercise is better than none. So maybe try out a few different things and see what feels best for you. It might be a walk with a friend, a yoga or Pilates class, or a weekly session with an Accredited Exercise Physiologist.\\n\\nWHAT SHOULD I BE CAREFUL OF?\\n\\nLymphedema is swelling of the arm or upper limb which can occur in women who have had lymph nodes removed or damaged during surgery. The good news is that exercise and regular movement can reduce your risk of developing lymphoedema as well as managing symptoms for those who do have lymphoedema.\\n\\nRemember, gradual implementation of exercise is key and will assist in your recovery on many levels. Weight gain is very common after diagnosis which can be related to treatment options as well as lack of activity. Regular physical activity will not only help you to manage your weight but also improve your lean muscle mass so that you are able to maintain your strength and function.\\n\\nMOTIVATION AND WHERE TO START?\\n\\n» Remember, start small. Set realistic goals for yourself. » It might help to have an exercise buddy or friend or family member who joins you or just checks in on how you\\n\\nare going.\\n\\n» Set a reminder on your phone or place a reminder quote on your fridge. » Keep a diary of how you are feeling. An exercise or mood diary can be satisfying to see you commitment but\\n\\nalso provide you with insight on how physical activity is affecting other areas of your life and well-being.\\n\\n» Research suitable groups and sessions in your local area and community.\\n\\n15\\n\\nWHAT MIGHT BE SOME OF THE BARRIERS AND WHAT SHOULD I DO ABOUT THEM?\\n\\nFinances\\n\\nIt is important you find an exercise option that suits your budget. This will ensure a sustainable approach to physical activity as well as reduce any extra stress you may have relating to finances.\\n\\n» Opt for the outdoors! It’s free! Try going for a walk or jog in the local park or completing some body weight\\n\\nexercises in the garden.\\n\\n» Research cost-effective programs in your local community. Most local councils offer walking groups, tai-chi\\n\\nor yoga programs which are either free or very low cost options.\\n\\nYou may be eligible for a rebate from your Private Health Insurance for any sessions provided by an Accredited Exercise Physiologist. This is something to be mindful of when researching suitable providers and locations.\\n\\nSide Effects of Treatment\\n\\nFatigue and nausea are two big side effects experienced by those undergoing cancer treatment. Research shows that by even engaging in a small amount of structured physical activity, these side effects can be lessened and in some case even provide an energy boost. Try and choose a time to exercise which is most comfortable for you. For example, if you are often more fatigued or nauseated in the morning, opt for an afternoon exercise regime.\\n\\nWHAT SORT OF PROGRAMS MIGHT SUIT ME?\\n\\nMany Accredited Exercise Physiologists in the community may run or have access to targeted exercise groups for you to try. Some of these programs may also be low-cost options to make access easier for you and those in a similar position.\\n\\nExpert Contributor: Ismini Dandanis, Accredited Exercise Physiologist\\n\\n16\\n\\nHOLLY’S EXERCISE JOURNEY WITH BREAST CANCER\\n\\nAt 31, Holly was diagnosed with breast cancer. Shortly after her diagnosis, she started chemotherapy treatment and underwent a double mastectomy.\\n\\nHolly shares her exercise journey with us and how sessions with her Accredited Exercise Physiologist made her feel ‘amazing’ and ‘like her old self again’, physically and mentally.\\n\\nHolly encourages everyone going through cancer treatment to be physically active; “to be in control of something is a positive part of recovery that anyone can do.”\\n\\n17\\n\\nEXERCISING WITH YOUR MENSTRUAL CYCLE\\n\\nOur hormones control our body. Our bodies go through the menstrual cycle and this cycle can influence your metabolic state and results from training. Hormones, estrogen and progesterone, impact fat gain and loss due to their direct impact as well as effect on other hormones.\\n\\nOur menstrual cycle (here I’m talking about premenopausal women and those who are not using oral contraceptives):\\n\\n» The start of your cycle begins immediately after you finish the follicular phase from day 0 to 14, during this\\n\\nphase there is an increased estrogen and normal progesterone and an average body temperature.\\n\\n» From here we move to the ovulation phase around day 14. This is where our estrogen levels and progesterone\\n\\nlevels start to peak. From days 15 to 28, this is the luteal phase where estrogen declines, progesterone increases and our body temperature remains higher than baseline.\\n\\nLADIES, HERE IS WHAT YOU NEED TO KNOW ABOUT TRAINING AND YOUR MENSTRUAL CYCLE:\\n\\n» Our menstrual cycle has a huge influence on a females metabolic state and exercise results\\n\\nThe follicular phase in our cycles is when women should focus on progress – this is characterised by a\\n\\nhigher tolerance for pain and increased levels of endurance. During this time, our insulin sensitivity also increases hence allowing us to use more carbohydrates to fuel the session. This is the best time for HIIT training and sprinting.\\n\\nThe ovulation phase in our cycles is when women are more prone to injury but you will also notice that\\n\\nstrength levels will still be high.\\n\\nThe luteal phase in our cycles is when the body will rely on more fat as a fuel source, meaning our body temperatures will be higher, and in addition to this, you may be retaining excess water due to PMS increases in the cortisol, thus increasing sodium levels and causing retention. During this phase, doing workouts that utilise fat as fuel is a better choice; this is also a good time for active recovery or de-loading in strength training.\\n\\nIf you are wanting to start a new exercise program, or have any concerns about exercising suitably for your menstrual cycle, contact your local Accredited Exercise Physiologist.\\n\\nExpert Contributor: Kitty Chao, Accredited Exercise Physiologist\\n\\n18\\n\\nEXERCISE AND FEMALE SEXUAL DYSFUNCTION\\n\\nWHAT IS FEMALE SEXUAL DYSFUNCTION?\\n\\nFemale sexual dysfunction (FSD) affects approximately 40% of women. It is defined by the various ways in which an individual is unable to participate in a sexual relationship as she would wish. FSD is a very complex and multi- faceted disorder due to a woman’s perception on sex, comprising of anatomical, psychological, physiological, and social-interpersonal components.\\n\\nThere are multiple classifications of FSD: sexual desire disorder, sexual aversion disorder, sexual arousal disorder, sexual pain disorders, and female orgasmic disorders.\\n\\nWHAT CAUSES FEMALE SEXUAL DYSFUNCTION?\\n\\nThere are a variety of physical and mental factors that can contribute to the onset of FSD.\\n\\nPHYSICAL FACTORS:\\n\\nMENTAL FACTORS:\\n\\n» Vaginal atrophy » Trauma » Chronic conditions (eg. Endometriosis, Vulvodynia,\\n\\npelvic pain)\\n\\n» High-tone pelvic floor dysfunction » Increasing age » Pregnancy » Cardiovascular disease » Diabetes » Cancer survivors\\n\\n» Depression and use of anti-depressants » Anxiety » Guilt and/or shame » Past sexual trauma or abuse » Poor interpersonal relationship with partner » Body image issues\\n\\n19\\n\\nEXERCISE CAN HELP TREAT FSD!\\n\\n20 to 30 minutes of high intensity exercise approximately half an hour before sexual interaction has been shown to increase sexual arousal in FSD. This is attributed to the increase in sympathetic nervous system (SNS) activity. The SNS is our “fight or flight” response, increasing blood flow, dilating pupils, accelerating heart rate and increasing arterial blood pressure. This increase in SNS activity from exercise has the same effects seen during the later stages of female sexual arousal.\\n\\nThe pelvic floor muscles (PFM) also play a role in normal sexual function. They have the potential to increase lubrication, arousal, orgasm, and desire. If PFM are overactive, it can inhibit relaxation and sometimes cause contraction where relaxation is required, potentially causing painful intercourse. Alternatively, if PFM are underactive and cannot contract, incontinence and pelvic organ prolapse may result, both of which are contributing factors to FSD.\\n\\nRegular exercise combined with PFM exercises have also been shown to assist in sexual satisfaction indirectly by preserving autonomic flexibility, benefiting cardiovascular health and mood.\\n\\nWhen it comes to mental health, it has been well documented that exercise has a positive impact on depression, anxiety, and body image, all of which can increase sexual well-being.\\n\\nExercise causes a reduction in anxiety and increases blood flow and oxygen to the brain. This causes an elevated mood and decreases the negative thought patterns associated with FSD. Exercise also encourages feelings of self-efficacy and a shift from external to internal locus of control. This increases the feeling of having control over the issue.\\n\\nYoga, meditation and breathing exercises to help to relax the muscles and the mind are also beneficial.\\n\\nWHAT NOW?\\n\\n» Consult your GP or obstetrician-gynaecologist if\\n\\n» Exercise regularly to prevent comorbidities that\\n\\nyou are experiencing pain, vaginal bleeding or have any other concerns.\\n\\nmay worsen FSD, assist in treating depression and anxiety, and preserve SNS flexibility.\\n\\n» Consult an Accredited Exercise Physiologist to prescribe safe, effective, and individualised high intensity exercise, PFM exercise, and relaxation exercise.\\n\\n» Seek help from a sex therapist/psychologist to assist\\n\\nin psychological factors.\\n\\nIf you want to use exercise to help manage FSD, talking to an Accredited Exercise Physiologist is a great place to start.

Are your periods irregular or absent altogether? Is your skin breaking out like crazy? These are just a few signs that you may be suffering from Polycystic Ovarian Syndrome (PCOS), a hormonal condition that affects up to 18% of women. However, diet and exercise can be extremely helpful in treating the symptoms so you can lead a healthy, happy and fertile life.\\n\\nHOW PCOS AFFECTS YOUR BODY\\n\\n» Excess testosterone – we all produce some testosterone, but too much can prevent ovulation and change your\\n\\n»\\n\\nmenstrual cycle. Insulin resistance – your body has to produce much more insulin than normal to keep blood sugar levels stable. Excess insulin floating around also increases testosterone production and can lead to: • Reduced fertility • Irregular or absent periods • Excess hair on your body and face (hirsutism) • Less hair on your head (alopecia) • Changes in your skin, such as acne, or darkened skin patches\\n\\n» You may also notice a decline in mental health, with symptoms such as low self-esteem, body image concerns,\\n\\nor depression and anxiety from all these physical changes that arise after diagnosis.\\n\\nBut there’s good news! A lot of these signs and symptoms can be improved with a few tweaks to your lifestyle, particularly with exercise. Here are the best types of exercise to do and how they can help.\\n\\n1. CARDIO\\n\\nGood for reducing insulin resistance, boosting fertility, stabilising mood\\n\\nModerate exercise like brisk walking, jogging, cycling, or swimming are all great activities that can help with PCOS. This type of exercise increases your body’s sensitivity to insulin, which reduces your risk of cardiovascular disease and type 2 diabetes. Doing 30 minutes or more a day can also help with weight management, symptoms of depression and anxiety, as well as improving frequency of menstrual cycles and ovulation. And if you’re about to start IVF, regular light exercise can boost your reproductive success.\\n\\n2. STRENGTH TRAINING\\n\\nGood for reducing insulin resistance, increasing metabolic rate, improving body composition (more muscle and less fat tissue)\\n\\nBodyweight exercises like squats, push-ups, or tricep dips improve the function of insulin in your body, but can also boost your metabolism by building more muscle mass. Don’t worry though; you won’t bulk up unless you’re taking steroids! More muscle simply means burning more calories while exercising, but also throughout the day, even at rest. Combining resistance moves with cardio exercise is the best way to ensure you’re building a lean body, achieving a healthy BMI, and reducing your risk of chronic diseases like type 2 diabetes.\\n\\n21\\n\\n3. INTERVAL TRAINING\\n\\nGood for increasing cardiovascular fitness, decreasing waist circumference, and achieving a healthy BMI\\n\\nIntervals involve swapping between short bouts of high intensity work and lower intensity recovery. It’s a time efficient way of boosting your cardiovascular fitness, with extra benefits for PCOS. Going hard on the spin bike burns bucket-loads of calories, and reduces abdominal fat more effectively than say, a brisk walk. This can help you achieve a 5-10% weight loss, which studies show can decrease PCOS symptoms by reducing excess testosterone and improving insulin resistance.\\n\\n4. CORE STRENGTH\\n\\nGood for general well-being and injury prevention, preparing your body for pregnancy\\n\\nBeing above your ideal weight can cause lower back pain and poor posture, so including core training in your program is essential. These muscles support the spine and learning how to switch them on ensures you don’t injure yourself during exercise. Also if you’re trying to conceive, start training your pelvic floor muscles! These muscles are also part of your core and help prevent incontinence, boost sexual health, and improve pelvic stability to help support a healthy pregnancy.\\n\\nThe most effective exercise is the one you can keep up with, so choose something you enjoy! Seeking help from an Accredited Exercise Physiologist is a great way to guarantee you’re exercising right for your condition. They can provide a tailored exercise program as well as lifestyle advice and support to help you reach your health and well- being goals.\\n\\nExpert Contributor: Sarah King, Accredited Exercise Physiologist\\n\\n22\\n\\nEXERCISING FOR ENDOMETRIOSIS\\n\\nEndometriosis, also known as ’endo’, is a chronic health condition affecting one in ten women worldwide, yet unfortunately there is little information available around how exercise can help manage and improve the painful symptoms associated with an endo diagnosis.\\n\\nExercise may be the last thing you feel like doing, and there are some inappropriate exercises that may worsen your current symptoms, but returning to exercise post-diagnosis can be important for both your physical and mental health!\\n\\nWHAT IS ENDOMETRIOSIS?\\n\\nEndometriosis is a gynaecological condition where endometrial-like tissue grows outside the uterine cavity. We say endometrial-like, as this tissue is not identical to the cells found within the uterine cavity, however it has a lot of similar properties.\\n\\nEndometriosis is fuelled by the hormone oestrogen, however we are still learning and discovering exactly what causes this tissue growth. This tissue can attach itself anywhere within the pelvic and abdominal cavity, with reports of endometriosis even found on the diaphragm (though this is very rare)! Unfortunately, the human body is not equipped to remove these tissue growths, and they continue to act as endometrial-like cells, and with every menstrual cycle, scar tissue and adhesions can form through the release of oestrogen. This can cause a wide range of symptoms, including inflammation, bloating, and pelvic pain and cramping. Currently, the gold standard diagnosis for endometriosis is a laparoscopy or key-hole surgery, and as a result, starting exercise following this surgery can be a daunting prospect.\\n\\nBEST EXERCISES TO START WITH POST-ENDO DIAGNOSIS:\\n\\nRegular physical exercise can have protective effects against diseases like endometriosis that involve inflammatory processes since it causes an increase of the anti-inflammatory and antioxidant markers within the body, and also acts by reducing oestrogen levels, making it a great idea to incorporate exercise into your recovery and disease management.\\n\\nThe pain and discomfort associated with endometriosis can cause a guarding mechanism within the body – where the body braces to protect itself from pain. This bracing can affect the pelvic floor, abdominal wall and hip flexors – the anterior side of the body.\\n\\nSo firstly, when resuming exercise, it is important to first focus on the lengthening and strengthening of these muscle groups. You can’t strengthen a tight muscle! Exercises based around the principles of Pilates and yoga can be fantastic to help these muscles release or stretches such as seated glute stretch, seated hip flexor stretch and a wall side bend stretch can really help to release those muscle groups.\\n\\n23\\n\\nWHAT NEXT\\n\\nIt is great to then progress to reconnect with your core and the muscles around the pelvis – the pelvic floor and glutes! Gentle progression into resistance-based exercises to start activating the glutes include exercises such as:\\n\\n» Clams or side lying leg raises » » Glute bridging with theraband\\n\\nSit to stands\\n\\nThese muscles help to support the lumbo-pelvic region of the body, so gradually adding in strengthening exercises can help manage your symptoms by balancing out that bracing and tightness through your anterior core muscles.\\n\\nGoing for a gentle walk for 30 to 60 minutes can always be a fantastic way to get back into the routine of regular exercise, and is a great addition to the above exercises.\\n\\nSOME EXERCISES TO AVOID FOLLOWING AN ENDO DIAGNOSIS:\\n\\n» » High-impact exercises e.g. running/burpees\\n\\nSit-ups and crunches\\n\\nThat’s not to say you can never return to high-impact exercise, however your body will require some rest and recovery to allow itself to heal while reducing these guarding postures!\\n\\nIt is always best to start slowly when experiencing pain or discomfort, or after surgery. It is always best to seek the guidance of an Accredited Exercise Physiologist to help return you to the exercise that you love to do – and help you to manage your symptoms moving forward!\\n\\nExpert Contributor: Brittany Cogger, Accredited Exercise Physiologist\\n\\n24\\n\\nEXERCISING DURING PREGNANCY\\n\\nWhat an exciting (not to mention worrying, stressful, anxious and busy) time if you are expecting. A common concern of expectant mothers is – is it safe to exercise throughout my pregnancy?\\n\\nIt is always recommended to speak with your doctor or obstetrician before commencing a new exercise regime or continuing with exercise throughout your pregnancy. Once given the all clear, your next best point of call is an Accredited Exercise Physiologist. All Accredited Exercise Physiologists are trained to be able to prescribe safe and suitable exercise throughout your entire pregnancy. An Accredited Exercise Physiologist is your best resource to advise you on what to do and what not to do with your exercise regime whilst you are expecting.\\n\\nWHY SHOULD YOU EXERCISE DURING PREGNANCY\\n\\nExercise may be the last thing you are feeling like doing whilst battling nausea and fatigue, amongst a host of other symptoms, however it is one of the best things that you can do for the health of you and your baby. Exercise is a great way to prevent gestational diabetes and excessive weight gain; improve your energy and mood; keep your body strong (in preparation for lifting your new baby!); help you sleep well; and prepare you for labour.\\n\\nExercise is also a great way to prevent and treat back and postural pain associated with changes in body shape that occur with pregnancy. Back pain is common and can be related to the changes in centre of gravity which occur as baby moves forward, causing an increased arch (also known as lordosis) in the lower back. Postural or thoracic pain can also be experienced as the breasts increase in size and consequently cause the shoulders and mid back area to slump forward.\\n\\nWHAT TYPES OF EXERCISE SHOULD YOU DO WHILE PREGNANT\\n\\n‘Pregnancy Pilates’ is one of the best forms of exercise to tackle both back and postural pain, as well as strengthen the core and pelvic floor, stretch tight muscles and assist to relieve generalised muscular aches.\\n\\nOther safe options for physical activity include walking, stationary cycling and aquatic/water exercise. If given the all clear by your doctor, these gentle forms of exercise can often be continued throughout the entire pregnancy.\\n\\n25\\n\\nNot all types of exercise are safe throughout pregnancy, so again, it is always recommended to seek the advice of an Accredited Exercise Physiologists to avoid doing more harm than good. A small example of exercises to avoid include sit-ups or crunches, contact sports, activities which increase your risk of having a fall, ballistic exercises (i.e. bouncing or jumping), and exercises lying on your back.\\n\\nHOW MUCH IS ENOUGH\\n\\nThe current recommendation is that pregnant women aim to meet the prescribed physical activity levels of the Australian Physical Activity Guidelines, which is 150 minutes of moderate intensity or 75 minutes of vigorous intensity exercise a week, or a combination of both, using the ‘talk test’ (page 10) as an intensity guide. It is important to consider your activity level before you were pregnant and progress your exercise slowly under the guidance of an Accredited Exercise Physiologists. Always listen to your body, as you know it best; being aware of any adverse symptoms including dizziness, bleeding or leaking of amniotic fluid, decreased foetal movement, headaches, unusual swelling, nausea or vomiting. Ensure to seek immediate medical attention if you do experience any of the above mentioned.\\n\\nExpert Contributor: Jadi Lacco, Accredited Exercise Physiologist\\n\\n26\\n\\nEXERCISING FOR GESTATIONAL DIABETES\\n\\nAs our lifestyles change and women have children at a later age, the prevalence of gestational diabetes has risen. Currently 68 Australian women are diagnosed every day.\\n\\nThere are many treatment options available including dietary changes implemented by an Accredited Dietitian and regular exercise prescribed by an Accredited Exercise Physiologist. Regular exercise can help manage blood sugar levels, and improve the health and well-being of both mum and bubs.\\n\\nNever fear, this exercise doesn’t have to be hours in a gym, it can be as gentle as a daily walk!\\n\\nWHAT IS GESTATIONAL DIABETES?\\n\\nGestational diabetes is typically tested for at 24-28 weeks gestation. For the test, the mother usually has blood samples taken before and after a sugary drink being consumed. Gestational diabetes is diagnosed when the mothers blood sugar levels are too high before the sugary drink is consumed (fasted blood sugar level >5.1mmol) or too high two hours after the drink has been consumed (blood sugar level >8.5mmol).\\n\\nTry to imagine insulin is a key, floating through the blood stream, unlocking doors to allow sugar to enter the cells.\\n\\nDuring pregnancy, the placenta releases hormones which reduce the mother’s sensitivity to insulin, so the key no longer goes in to the door as easily as it did before.\\n\\nThis means her placenta must release more insulin to allow sugar to enter the cells around her body. Gestational diabetes occurs when the mother’s pancreas is unable to release enough insulin (keys) to get all the sugar in to her cells (through the door), which increases the amount of sugar floating around in her blood. If not properly controlled, this additional sugar will instead go to baby resulting in a heavier birth weight and placing stress on the baby’s developing pancreas.\\n\\n27\\n\\nHOW DOES EXERCISE HELP MANAGE GESTATIONAL DIABETES?\\n\\nExercise helps manage gestational diabetes by increasing the number of doors available for the insulin keys to fit in. This subsequently increases the amount of sugar which can be burned by cells.\\n\\nExercise also helps reduce blood sugar levels through the additional energy expended during the exercise and in the hours after exercise which further assists in reducing blood sugar levels.\\n\\nWHAT IS THE BEST TYPE OF EXERCISE?\\n\\nThe ideal exercise program is something you can complete most days of the week. An Accredited Exercise Physiologist can create an individualised exercise program, including a mix of both aerobic exercise and strength training.\\n\\nOptions include walking, swimming, light weights training, body weight exercises, and Pilates. Daily pelvic floor strengthening exercises are also an important inclusion for all pregnant women.\\n\\nFor optimal results, you should aim to complete aerobic exercise for at least 30 minutes, 5 days per week, and 8 – 12 different strength exercises, 3 days per week. These strength exercises should target major muscles all over the body.\\n\\nTHINGS TO CONSIDER\\n\\n» Always check with your obstetrician or midwife prior to beginning a new exercise program. » Always seek guidance from an Accredited Exercise Physiologist for exercise prescription. »\\n\\nSpeak to your obstetrician, midwife or diabetes educator for guidance on exercise timing if you are taking insulin medications.\\n\\nExpert Contributor: Bryannah Downward, Accredited Exercise Physiologist\\n\\n28\\n\\nEXERCISING SAFELY POSTPARTUM\\n\\nWhat to do and when to start exercise following childbirth can be confusing for a new mum. However, it is an important topic to address as exercise postpartum can have a multitude of benefits for both physical and mental well-being including helping to prevent postnatal depression, relieve stress and increase energy.\\n\\nGetting the right advice and following evidence based professional guidelines for postpartum exercise can help you to experience the multitude of benefits of exercise whilst staying safe. Your local Accredited Exercise Physiologist will be your best resource for guidance and expertise regarding safe exercise if you have recently given birth, whether it be a natural birth or caesarean delivery. Your Accredited Exercise Physiologist may ask for a clearance from your obstetrician or doctor before recommending exercise, depending on the type of delivery and if there were any complications.\\n\\nWHEN IS IT SAFE TO START EXERCISING AGAIN?\\n\\nThis will be different for each new mum, dependent on the type of delivery she endured and any complications that may have arisen. For a healthy pregnancy followed by a normal vaginal delivery, The American Congress of Obstetricians and Gynecologists indicates that it is safe to commence gentle exercise (for example a slow short walk) 2-3 days after giving birth, if feeling up to it. For anyone with complications throughout the pregnancy or delivery, or if undergone a caesarean delivery, speak to your obstetrician or health professional and get the all clear first.\\n\\nHOW MUCH EXERCISE SHOULD I BE AIMING FOR?\\n\\nIt is important to be patient when returning to exercise postpartum, as too much too soon can do more harm than good. Try not to overdo an exercise program in the early days and resist the temptation to jump straight back into a pre-pregnancy regime. The American Congress of Obstetricians and Gynecologists recommendation for postpartum exercise is to start with 20-30 minutes of gentle physical activity per day, remembering that this can be broken up into small 10 minute bouts.\\n\\nWHAT TYPES OF EXERCISE ARE SAFE?\\n\\nShortly after a natural birth, your midwife may prescribe a small range of pelvic floor and gentle abdominal exercises to start to re-activate and strengthen the core. Again it is important to acknowledge that every delivery is different and to be guided by a health professional with regards to the type of exercises that are safe for you.\\n\\nThe safest type of aerobic exercise to start with is walking, which has the added bonus of being an outdoor activity for the often housebound new mum, as well as being an activity that can be done with baby. Start with slow, short and gentle walks which can be progressed by increasing speed, duration and adding small hills as you feel that you can. It is generally not recommended to introduce jogging until at least 12 weeks and, even at this stage, only after a clearance from a health professional. Introducing high impact activities (including jogging and aerobics) too early postpartum can overload already unstable joints and the pelvic floor, increasing the risk of sustaining an injury or a pelvic organ prolapse.\\n\\n29\\n\\nThe new mum will often be subjected to a lot of incidental strengthening exercises in the early days postpartum including lifting, carrying and bouncing the baby, which is a safe and gentle re-introduction to strength based exercises. Following a caesarean delivery, this is the limit to strength based exercises for the first 6 weeks. You can generally start to slowly increase your strength regime if cleared by your obstetrician after 6 weeks.\\n\\nIS THERE ANYTHING ELSE THAT I NEED TO CONSIDER BEFORE STARTING EXERCISE?\\n\\nYes – be prepared! Invest in a supportive bra; keep well hydrated (this is particularly important for the breastfeeding mum); and if breastfeeding, feed your baby or express prior to your exercise to avoid any discomfort in the breasts.\\n\\nMOTIVATION\\n\\nIf you are struggling to find the drive and energy to get moving again, you are not alone. You could try joining a class, for example a mums and bubs Pilates or yoga; or rally other new mums to form a regular walking group. The social interaction, support and motivation that can come from group exercise can also be a great for your mental health.\\n\\nTAKE HOME TIPS\\n\\n» Always get a clearance from a health professional before recommencing exercise »\\n\\nStart small and increase the exercise regime slowly. Be patient and mindful of what your body has endured and avoid being impatient to return to your pre-pregnancy regime too quickly\\n\\n» Break your exercise into small bouts throughout the day » Avoid high impact exercise for at least the first 12 weeks » »\\n\\nListen to your body Join a class\\n\\nAnd, most importantly, sleep when the baby sleeps!\\n\\nExpert Contributor: Jadi Lacco, Accredited Exercise Physiologist\\n\\n30\\n\\nEXERCISE TO BATTLE POSTNATAL DEPRESSION\\n\\nAccording to Perinatal Anxiety & Depression Australia (PANDA), postnatal depression is effecting more than 1 in 7 new mums each year in Australia, and it’s important to understand the difference between ‘feeling a bit down’ and having a mental health condition.\\n\\nPostnatal depression is different from the ‘baby blues’, which many women experience in the early days after giving birth associated with hormonal cascades. Some signs of PND are consistent low mood, anxiety, feelings of guilt, shame, worthlessness, or hopelessness. PND is depression occurring in the months following childbirth. The onset of PND tends to be gradual and may persist for many months and even years.\\n\\nSome parents feel ashamed if they are not coping and so may try to hide their struggles. However, PND is a serious condition and if left untreated, it may develop into chronic depression or recur when another baby is born. For a better over look at postnatal depression and its symptoms and signs, please visit Beyond Blue.\\n\\nIf you are a new parent worried about your emotional and mental wellbeing it’s important to seek support from a trusted health professional. Your GP should be able to help you understand what is happening and direct you to the best treatment options. These might include counselling, methods of self-care, medication or direction to appropriate information and resources.\\n\\nIt’s also important for a GP to rule out any other physical conditions that we know can contribute to feelings of depression, anxiety, low energy or lack of motivation. If these are identified and treated the feelings that are worrying you may stop.\\n\\nWe know depression can impact on your ability to complete your everyday tasks and activities, let alone the additional demands of caring for a newborn. It can be hard to manage alone, so it’s important to be aware of the signs of postnatal depression, and to seek help from family, friends and professionals.\\n\\n31\\n\\nExercising before and during pregnancy is healthy for both you and baby, however evidence shows that continuing to exercise postpartum is a vital tool in enhancing mental and physical health and an effective treatment in reducing the symptoms and severity of postnatal depression.\\n\\nExercise is a form of medicine, and we know it can help improve your mood, as well as assist with your sleep quality and energy levels, as well as your physical recovery from pregnancy and delivery.\\n\\nIMPORTANT THINGS TO NOTE:\\n\\n» » Make sure you get clearance from your doctor at a postpartum check-up prior to seeing an accredited exercise professional such as an Accredited Exercise Physiologist or Accredited Exercise Scientist.\\n\\nIf you are concerned about postnatal depression seek advice from your GP as soon as you can.\\n\\n» Not all exercises are suitable for postpartum women, so it’s important to seek professional advice early to\\n\\n»\\n\\nensure you receive expert care from an exercise professional.

All of the pelvic organs are supported by a complex of muscles, ligaments, and fascia that attach to the bony anatomy of the pelvis. When these are weakened, those organs can descend.\\n\\nDepending on which organs are involved, POP can be diagnosed as ‘anterior wall’ (involving the bladder), posterior wall (involving the bowel), uterine or vaginal vault.\\n\\nAlmost one in five Australian women will be affected by prolapse during their lifetime, and it is important to remember that prolapse is common and manageable.\\n\\nWHAT CAN CAUSE POP?\\n\\n» Vaginal delivery with interventions like forceps or vacuum, or a long second stage of labour (push phase) » Being overweight » Constipation » Persistent heavy lifting with bad technique » Excessive coughing – causing repetitive straining » Changes in hormonal levels with menopause or surgery like hysterectomy\\n\\nWHAT ARE POP SYMPTOMS?\\n\\nProlapse can have a variety of symptoms, including:\\n\\n» Pressure, pain, or fullness in pelvis, or a visible lump around the pelvis » Feeling a downward dragging or like a tampon falling out » Urinary incontinence » Difficulty going to the toilet » »\\n\\nLower back, pelvic or abdominal pain Lack of sexual sensation or painful intercourse\\n\\nWomen can be hesitant to openly discuss these symptoms, but prolapse is very important to identify, and modifying exercises is necessary for exercise to be performed safely.\\n\\nIf you think you may have prolapse, first seek guidance from your GP or Women’s Health Exercise Physiologist.\\n\\n33\\n\\nWHY IS EXERCISE IMPORTANT?\\n\\nExercise is important for your general health and fitness, and especially important for maintaining bone mineral density and mobility moving towards menopause.\\n\\nSpecific exercises for prolapse, including pelvic floor exercises, can help improve and manage prolapse symptoms and support your body, however certain exercises are contraindicated for prolapse – and can make things worse.\\n\\nTherefore, it’s important to seek help from a professional, such as an Accredited Exercise Physiologist, to ensure you are exercising safely.\\n\\nPELVIC FLOOR EXERCISES:\\n\\n» » Reduce the risk of prolapse » »\\n\\nImprove bladder and bowel control\\n\\nImprove recovery from childbirth, gynaecological surgery and prolapse Increase sexual sensation and orgasmic potential increase social confidence and quality of life\\n\\nPelvic floor exercises have their place to help improve motor control, strength and endurance of your pelvic floor, however a program of these exercises alone is not enough!\\n\\nEXERCISE CONSIDERATIONS:\\n\\n» » Avoid holding your breath by exhaling with effort. » Maintain good posture. » Avoid all abdominal exercises like sit ups and crunches – and instead chose abdominal exercises that\\n\\nLighten your weights or resistance so that you don’t feel pressure down on your pelvic floor as you move.\\n\\nresistance lateral and frontal flexion like side planks.\\n\\n» Keep your legs closer together during exercise, no wide legged squats or squat jumps. »\\n\\nLift your pelvic floor before you move and relax afterwards. Notice how many reps that you can do before your pelvic floor muscles tire.\\n\\n» You may need to add some rests, or reduce the number of reps that you do in a row, while your pelvic floor\\n\\nmuscle fitness improves.\\n\\nWANT TO LEARN MORE?\\n\\nAn Accredited Exercise Physiologist can help create an individualised exercise program for you that is pelvic floor safe and may help elevate your prolapse symptoms, allowing you to transition back to moving without fear, return to sport and support you to reach your personal fitness goals.\\n\\nExpert Contributor: Esme Soan, Accredited Exercise Physiologist\\n\\n34\\n\\nEXERCISING FOR MENOPAUSE\\n\\nAs we progress through the lifespan, our body is challenged in different ways. Menopause is no different. With changing body composition, energy levels, hormone balance and more, it is a period of adjustment and refocusing on lifestyle choices and behaviour changes.\\n\\nMenopause refers to the end of menstruation and is said to have occurred when a woman has not had a period for 12 months. Australian women typically experience menopause between ages 50-55 years, although this can occur in younger women secondary to surgery, chemotherapy or radiation.\\n\\nA significant change that occurs in menopause is weight gain, especially around the waist, which is not only uncomfortable but also a significant risk factor for other health conditions. A woman’s risk for numerous medical conditions, including breast cancer, type 2 diabetes, and heart disease, rises during and after menopause.\\n\\nBeing physically active and maintaining a healthy weight can help offset these risks.\\n\\nEXERCISE BENEFITS WOMEN DURING MENOPAUSE IN SEVERAL WAYS INCLUDING:\\n\\n» » » » » Reduced incidence of chronic disease (i.e. type 2 diabetes and heart disease) » Improved quality of life » Enhanced mental health » Reduced stress »\\n\\nImprove sleep and reduction in disturbances experienced Improved mood Improved weight control Increased/maintained bone density and strength\\n\\nImproved balance and falls prevention\\n\\nWHAT TYPE OF EXERCISE IS IMPORTANT?\\n\\nA variety of aerobic, strength, balance and flexibility exercises should be prescribed to build your exercise tolerance, improve muscle and bone strength and increase your stability.\\n\\nAerobic activity that makes use of your large muscle groups while keeping up your heart rate is recommended – walking, jogging, biking, and swimming all count.\\n\\nAlso consider the intensity of the exercise – it is different for everyone. Ideally a moderate intensity exercise program will provide you with the above mentioned benefits of regular physical activity.\\n\\nDuring menopause, the hormonal changes (particularly oestrogen) means that the risk of developing osteoporosis, or brittle bones, is significantly greater. This is where strength-based training is particularly beneficial to continue to load your muscles, bones and joints in a safe way to build strength and prevent or slow the progression disease.\\n\\n35\\n\\nAlso consider your preferences for exercise and your physical symptoms of this life stage. You might feel more comfortable exercising outside in the fresh air or with layers of clothing you can peel off as your body temperature increases (or the hot flush comes!).\\n\\nIf you are experiencing hot flushes, it is recommended to exercise in a relaxed environment that has a focus on deep relaxed breathing such as yoga, Tai chi or low impact classes that focus on slow controlled breathing with the movement.\\n\\nKeep yourself hydrated by aiming for 30ml of water per kilogram of body weight each day. This might seem like a lot if you aren’t used to drinking a lot of water, so build it up gradually.\\n\\nSO, WHERE DO YOU START?\\n\\nTalk to an exercise professional. An Accredited Exercise Physiologist will ensure the most suitable program to suit your needs and abilities. They will adopt a holistic approach to your health and well-being goals and work with you to track your progress and adjust your exercise regime to reflect your progress.\\n\\nIdeally, aim for 30 minutes of activity 5 days per week. That is, a total of 150 minutes per week to meet the National Physical Activity Guidelines for Australian Adults. Start small and build up from there. Your body will thank you for it!\\n\\nExpert Contributor: Ismini Dandanis, Accredited Exercise Physiologist\\n\\n36\\n\\nEXERCISING AFTER A HYSTERECTOMY\\n\\nUnfortunately, many women are left in the dark about how to safely return to exercise after a hysterectomy.\\n\\nThere are some inappropriate abdominal exercises after hysterectomy that can increase the risk of injury to the pelvic floor (e.g. pelvic organ prolapse or hernia), but we know how important exercise is – both for physical and mental health!\\n\\nThere are some exercises however, that are better than others for recovering and returning to exercise after hysterectomy, and it is always best to seek the advice of an Accredited Exercise Physiologist to help rehabilitate and return to the activity you love to do – and protect your pelvic floor for the future.\\n\\nWHAT IS A HYSTERECTOMY?\\n\\nA hysterectomy is an operation to remove the uterus – and depending on the type of hysterectomy being performed, accompanying organs such as the fallopian tubes, ovaries and cervix are often removed at the same time.\\n\\nMost hysterectomies are performed to treat conditions such as fibroids (growths that form inside the uterus), endometriosis, adenomyosis, pelvic organ prolapse and cancer.\\n\\nHysterectomy is one of the most common types of elective surgeries for Australian women, but although this surgery is common, it is important to remember that it is a major abdominal surgery that requires a period of rehabilitation afterwards!\\n\\nBEST EXERCISES TO START WITH AFTER A HYSTERECTOMY:\\n\\nFirst time back at the gym after surgery? Or looking to get started again at home?\\n\\nThe best exercise to start with is walking. Walking is fantastic functional exercise, and hill walking is a great way to challenge your cardiovascular fitness without risking injury to your pelvic floor.\\n\\nIt is also great to start to reconnect with your pelvic floor and core by performing some pelvic floor exercises (aka kegels) and core breathing. At times, these exercises can be difficult to do, but an Accredited Exercise Physiologist can help you!\\n\\n37\\n\\nPELVIC FLOOR ELEVATORS\\n\\n»\\n\\n» »\\n\\n»\\n\\nStart by lying on your back, with knees bent and feet flat. Take a gentle inhale breath for 3-4 seconds, breathing into your ribcage and tummy, and gently exhale through pursed lips for 5 seconds. Think of your pelvic floor like an elevator, with closing doors and a G floor, and 1st floor. Start your pelvic floor contraction by ‘closing the elevator doors’ (squeeze around anus and urethra like you are trying to stop the flow of urine) Then, feel a gentle lift of the pelvic floor elevator up to the 1st floor.\\n\\nAlways remember to relax your pelvic floor again, by letting it descend back to G floor, and allowing the doors to open. This should not be forceful – but just a relaxation.\\n\\nFinally, some gentle stretches and mobility work will help get your body ready to move again. Some of our favourites are a seated glute stretch, seated hip flexor stretch and a wall side bend stretch.\\n\\nSOME EXERCISES TO AVOID AFTER HYSTERECTOMY ARE:\\n\\n» High impact exercises e.g. running/jumping/burpees » Abdominal exercises e.g. sit ups/crunches/planks » Heavily loaded resistance exercises e.g. anything that makes you hold your breath or grunt to lift\\n\\nImmediately after surgery (within first 6 weeks post-surgery) you may be advised to avoid lifting anything heavier than 4kg, and avoid prolonged standing.\\n\\nThis is not to say you can never perform these types of exercises again, but that your body will require some recovery, rehabilitation and regain strength in your pelvic floor and core before you can return to this kind of high impact or heavy loaded work.\\n\\nFinally, it is always best to start slowly when returning to the gym after major surgery, and if your exercise or activity goal is to return to high impact work like running or sport, seek the help of a professional like an Accredited Exercise Physiologist to help get you there safely and successfully!\\n\\nExpert Contributor: Esme Soan, Accredited Exercise Physiologist\\n\\n38\\n\\nEXERCISING TO BUILD STRENGTH AND PREVENT FALLS\\n\\nAs women age, exercise may become daunting, especially post-joint replacement or after years of sedentary behaviour. Sometimes people may not know the safest way to start with a routine, they may be weary of their balance deteriorating, or they may be living with chronic pain.\\n\\nBalance exercises are paramount for all individuals but become increasingly important to reduce the risk of falls in the elderly. Falls may include slips, trips and near misses. They can happen to anyone, but if falls do occur, injuries are more significant the older we get.\\n\\nCOMMON INJURIES INCLUDE:\\n\\n» Hip and wrist fractures » Hip and shoulder dislocations » Head injuries and abrasions » Bruising and sprains » Fear of falling that can result in loss of confidence and restriction of activities\\n\\nRemember: falls are preventable.\\n\\nWith all this in mind, surely each of us knows either a family member, neighbour or friend that may benefit from some balance and leg strengthening. Perhaps it’s even yourself. Please spare some time in your busy lives to try and practice these exercises together.\\n\\nHOME EXERCISES\\n\\nSome simple exercises can be practiced at home to reduce the risk of falls. They can be practiced sporadically throughout the day and you can build up your capacity slowly.\\n\\nSome pointers:\\n\\n» Move slowly. » » Hold on to a strong support such as the kitchen table/sturdy chair against a wall. »\\n\\nStop if you feel faint or experience sharp pains.\\n\\nStand tall and breathe deeply to improve your posture.\\n\\n39\\n\\n1. Heel to toe balance\\n\\nAs well as improving overall balance, this exercise will help you keep your balance if you should have to walk through a narrow space.\\n\\nLevel 1: Feet together\\n\\nLevel 2: Step forward\\n\\nLevel 3: Heel to toe standing\\n\\nChoose a level appropriate for you.\\n\\nHINT: You should feel a tiny bit wobbly, but not so wobbly you feel you will fall. By feeling wobbly you will help train leg strength and balance.\\n\\nPractice: 4 x 10 seconds – alternating between left and right foot in front.\\n\\nYou may find that it is a lot easier to balance one leg than the other. This is okay, just persevere with both legs, so that you do not favour one side too heavily when walking and stepping.\\n\\nRemember to hold on – this is not cheating! Maintain a tall stance and as you improve try to hold on with just fingertips held lightly on support.\\n\\n2. Sideways walking\\n\\nThis exercise will help improve hip stability, and help you keep your balance if you need to take a sideways step to avoid oncoming traffic or in the instance of recovering from a bump from side on (relying on your new-found leg strength!).\\n\\nPractice: 2 x 10 steps – either on the spot or up and back the length of the kitchen bench or wall.\\n\\nSteps don’t need to be excessively large, small is fine too.\\n\\nRemember to hold on, maintain a tall stance and as you improve try to hold on with just fingertips.\\n\\n40\\n\\n3. Marching on the spot\\n\\nThis exercise will help with foot clearance over steps, help with getting in and out of a car or bus and help you feel stronger and less fatigued in climbing up the dreaded stairs.\\n\\nPractice: 2 x 5-10 steps – alternate between lifting the left and right legs.\\n\\nFeel free to hold on to two strong supports, one in each hand.\\n\\nStand tall. Keep the body straight (avoid leaning to one side).\\n\\nDon’t worry if the knee doesn’t lift to knee height, lift as high as you feel comfortable with – it will improve over time!\\n\\nExercises to improve balance are best practiced daily. Try to complete the above exercises as often as possible for the best outcomes. Perhaps take 5 minutes to try after breakfast is cleared from the bench, see how you go.\\n\\nPlease see an exercise professional, such as an Accredited Exercise Physiologist, if you have any concerns before commencing a balance program or for further advice.\\n\\nExpert Contributor: Alex Hardy, Accredited Exercise Physiologist\\n\\n41\\n\\nPAULINE’S EXERCISE JOURNEY TO BUILD STRENGTH AND PREVENT FALLS\\n\\nPauline felt like she was losing her ability to enjoy life. Her general health and well-being was declining and she felt her quality of life was slipping away. Pauline relied on walking aids, struggled to walk more than very short distances, and was unable to walk up and down stairs.\\n\\nPauline proudly says that before she commenced her program with her Accredited Exercise Physiologist she was just ‘surviving’ – whereas now she is ‘thriving’ and is now able to fully participate in life.\\n\\n42\\n\\nTHINGS TO REMEMBER\\n\\nAerobic activities and strength training are both important for women and their health.\\n\\nAerobic activity, aka any continuous exercise that makes your breathing increase, makes use of your large muscle groups while keeping up your heart rate. Walking, jogging, biking, and swimming all count and mixing your exercise up throughout the week will help to improve your motivation.\\n\\nStrength training will help to build bone and muscle strength, burn body fat, and rev up your metabolism. There are many different ways we can perform strength exercise. For example, holding onto weights (e.g. dumbbells), pushing or pulling loads (e.g. resistance bands, machines) or exercises as simple as moving your own body weight (e.g. squats, lunges). New to strength training? Start off with light weights and try to increase the weights you’re using over the following couple of weeks.\\n\\nIt’s always recommended that you speak to and gain advice from an Accredited Exercise Physiologist before commencing any new exercise programs to ensure it is safe for you and your health.\\n\\nTIPS FOR STAYING ON TRACK\\n\\nGrab a friend – Exercising with your partner, friends or family increases the likelihood that you’ll stick to your routine. Grab a buddy and get moving! Being held accountable for exercising with someone, and supporting each other’s goals, is proven to increase the amount of exercise undertaken.\\n\\nMaking time – One of the most common reasons for not exercising is lack of time. Sure, you’re busy, but it’s all about planning and prioritising. Your health is what’s most important. Even if it’s a 10-20 minute walk in your lunch break each day – something is better than nothing.\\n\\nHave fun – Exercise isn’t supposed to be a chore. Hate running? Don’t do it! Find something you enjoy and do that. Sometimes it can take time to find an exercise we enjoy, and that’s okay. There’s a variety of exercises available, and seeking advice from an Accredited Exercise Physiologist can help too.\\n\\nEvery bit counts – Don’t forget to make the most of incidental exercise. Take the stairs. Park your car further away from work. Opt for standing instead of sitting. It all adds up and every little bit counts.\\n\\nFor more exercise recommendations and motivation, you can find further information on the Exercise Right website, an ESSA initiative providing the public with information on how to exercise right for your health: www.exerciseright.com.au\\n\\n43\\n\\nWHAT DO OUR PROFESSIONALS HAVE TO SAY?\\n\\nTHE EXPERTS OF THE WOMEN’S HEALTH SPECIAL INTEREST GROUP SHARE THEIR REASONS FOR EXERCISING\\n\\nI partake in recreational Olympic weightlifting. It’s one way to break the stigma of women and lifting weights, and it’s also my ‘me’ time to block out work and life and ‘play’ for an hour. Kitty Chao, AEP\\n\\nI exercise because I know how good it is for my growing baby! As well as making me feel better too. It immediately reduces my overall fatigue, soreness and discomfort I am feeling as my body changes. Living in the NT there is no swimming as the water is full of crocs, so my go to exercise is using my exercise bike in front of the aircon and fan, and daily Pilates and an hour walk when it finally cools down! Alexandra Bruggisser, AEP\\n\\nI exercise to help manage fatigue and to give me energy. I’m now conscious of maintaining bone health in preparation for getting older, whilst also maintaining the strength, endurance and enthusiasm for combining the day-to-day running of my business with a balanced home life. In summer I love to swim – it’s like meditation; my thinking time to be present with myself. The same with walking around the river. I am also working on strength at the gym and challenging myself to be stronger. I want to be a role model for my niece, my nephew, and hopefully one day, my own kids. Rebecca Hallam, AEP\\n\\nAs the mum of a toddler, I have recently developed a strong passion for women’s health, particularly in regards to supporting women to maintain or rebuild activity levels with children, and also to model an active and healthy life for our children. Our family enjoys ‘adventures’ together, including surfing and bushwalking, and my daughter and I do yoga together and lots of walks and time on the trampoline. I also try to do exercise with her while she is at the park (I climb the equipment and play as well). With limited exercise time it’s all about having fun together. I rarely make time for my own ‘workout’ time in the way that I did pre-baby, although I imagine that will change as she gets older. Sonja Tayler, AEP\\n\\nI exercise to keep my mind clear and improve my sleep at night. I also exercise to relieve stress and have some focused ‘me’ time. I love that exercise makes me feel better about myself and gives a sense of accomplishment, in addition to helping maintain a healthy physique. Personally, I enjoy exercising with others and finding ways to exercise outdoors. I find exercising with friends also improves my motivation to exercise and stick to something. I love the beach so a run along the foreshore with a friend is always fun, as are outdoor Pilates and yoga sessions. Bryannah Downward, AEP\\n\\n44\\n\\nI own a Pilates studio that is basically populated by women; teenagers, women in their 20s through to their 70s. Each group has their different goals and restrictions based on their age and special population, from pre- and postnatal, who experience everything from pelvic pain, to low back pain, to rectus diastasis. Pilates is hands down my go to exercise for all of the above populations. Trissi Pearce, AEP\\n\\nI am currently exercising to help manage joint issues that are common during pregnancy. If I don’t keep up with it, pelvic pain increases and movements become more difficult. My go to exercise in final trimester is my exercise mat and resistance band in front of the TV when the kids are in bed. Jessica Bricklebank, AEP\\n\\nI try to move as much as possible with my kids in our daily lives to make it normal. They can join me in backyard strength circuits, we walk to school (rain or shine), and we spend as much time as possible in nature. When I can get away, I prefer kite surfing or hiking as these are good for my body, mind and soul. I find strength work very valuable at this stage of my life. I also love trying out new forms of exercise and am currently learning from some students of Ido Portal – very cool stuff, but very challenging for me! Stacey Pine, AEP\\n\\nI build exercise into my every day in some shape or form. I do it because it makes me feel great and I want to role model it for my daughter, plus I live in Brisbane where the climate is fantastic! I start every morning with a walk with my daughter outside, exploring our suburb, or by beautiful locations in our city. I swim, run, cycle, strength train and do yoga. We have a home gym where my 2-year-old watches (and copies) my strength sessions. I also always try to walk or cycle to things instead of going in the car if possible. Meg Achilles, AEP\\n\\nAt 25 and a mum of a little 2-year-old boy, exercise is my ‘me’ time that allows me to have the energy to keep up with being a mum and running a business. My go to exercise is circuit or HIIT training, especially in group settings, as I love how it motivates me. I also ensure I’m keeping my pelvic floor muscles strong and train them daily for at least 5-10 minutews, as I struggled with urge/stress incontinence postpartum. I’ve also just taken up sprinting again with the hope of making a return to competition. Exercise is my medicine and without it I would be stressed out, lethargic and cranky.

When it comes to fitness, like most male American slugs, I’m actually more of a complete blathering moronic idiot.

Now all I need to know is how to look cool and studly in the gym while sweating profusely.”\\n\\n—Steve Elling, Raleigh News & Observer\\n\\n“This book is a joy to read — written with wit and style, it comes as a wel- come reassurance that both razor-sharp accuracy and first-rate writing can co-exist in the same package.”\\n\\n—Jonathan Bowden, M.A.C.S.C.S., Senior Faculty, Equinox Fitness Training Institute and Contributing Editor, Fitness magazine\\n\\n“Fitness For Dummies is a smart buy for the exercise enthusiast. It’s the fitness equivalent of carbo-loading.”\\n\\n—Orange County Register\\n\\n“This is one of the most comprehensive, authoritative — and entertaining — fitness books I’ve ever seen.”\\n\\n—Men’s Fitness magazine\\n\\n“No one is more of a dummy when it comes to exercise than I am. Until I read Fitness For Dummies, I thought taking a book like this off the shelf counted as a workout. Now I know better. It’s only a warm-up!”\\n\\n—Phil Rosenthal, Columnist, Los Angeles Daily News\\n\\n“The exercise content and evaluations in this book are outstanding. Liz and Suzanne are the ultimate professionals, and Fitness For Dummies will help all exercisers maximize their potential.”\\n\\n—Fitness magazine\\n\\n“Fitness For Dummies is the definitive book for people who would like to achieve a stronger, healthier body.”\\n\\n—Mark Allen, Six-Time Ironman Champion\\n\\n“Suzanne and Liz have created an insider’s guide through the maze of mis- information about fitness. Before you buy an exercise gadget, a gym mem- bership, or a fitness video, read this book!”\\n\\n—Women’s Sports & Fitness magazine\\n\\n“Fitness For Dummies is a real rarity: a fitness book written by fitness writ- ers — two of the best. It’s full of smart, jargon-free, common-sense advice for anyone who’s interested in fitness. These two are not afraid to tell the truth. It’s like getting the word from a trusted friend.”\\n\\n—Shape magazine\\n\\n“I am duly impressed with the newest entry into the For Dummies series. From dispelling myths such as how we really burn fat to a comprehensive look at every choice of equipment on the market today, this book becomes a trustworthy, truly helpful guide to getting in shape.”\\n\\n—Diana Nyad, World Record Holder, Longest Swim in History, and TV\\n\\nBroadcaster\\n\\nFitness\\n\\nFOR\\n\\nDUMmIES‰\\n\\n3RD EDITION\\n\\nby Suzanne Schlosberg and Liz Neporent, M.A., with Tere Stouffer Drenth\\n\\nFitness For Dummies®, 3rd Edition Published by Wiley Publishing, Inc. 111 River St. Hoboken, NJ 07030-5774 www.wiley.com\\n\\nCopyright © 2005 by Wiley Publishing, Inc., Indianapolis, Indiana\\n\\nPublished simultaneously in Canada\\n\\nNo part of this publication may be reproduced, stored in a retrieval system, or transmitted in any form or by any means, electronic, mechanical, photocopying, recording, scanning, or otherwise, except as permitted under Sections 107 or 108 of the 1976 United States Copyright Act, without either the prior written permis- sion of the Publisher, or authorization through payment of the appropriate per-copy fee to the Copyright Clearance Center, 222 Rosewood Drive, Danvers, MA 01923, 978-750-8400, fax 978-646-8600.

things in life never change, like the traffic in Los Angeles or the\\n\\nweather in Tahiti. But fitness doesn’t fall into that category. In the exer- cise world, there’s something new in equipment, research, classes, gadgets, videos, and Web sites just about every day. In fact, so much has changed since the first two editions of Fitness For Dummies were published that we felt compelled to overhaul the book, adding several chapters and substantially revamping the others.\\n\\nSo what exactly is new in fitness? Health clubs are offering innovative new classes, like circuit training, cardio kickboxing, and firefighter boot camp, and nifty new machines, like the elliptical trainer. Yoga, Pilates, and other “mind- body” workouts have become so popular that we’ve devoted additional space to them. Technology has transformed fitness in many ways, too. And many clubs have invested in fancy entertainment systems so you can watch your own personal TV — or even surf the Internet — while running on the treadmill.\\n\\nOf course, this being the fitness industry, the last few years have also seen the invention and marketing of new schlock — like pills that claim to elimi- nate cellulite or burn extra carbohydrates and machines that purport to tone your thighs “without any effort on your part.” And there’s no shortage of hokey books, Web sites full of misleading fitness information, and magazine ads posing as articles. We help you sort through all of that.\\n\\nAbout This Book\\n\\nFitness For Dummies, 3rd Edition, updates you on all the latest — the good, the bad, and the totally weird. But our main mission remains the same as it was the first two times around: to tackle your fears, whether you worry that operating a stair-climber requires a degree in mechanical engineering or fret that no matter what exercise routine you start, sooner or later you’ll end up back in the recliner.\\n\\nWe don’t want you to become a fitness statistic. The fact is, among people who start an exercise program, half quit within eight weeks. This book gives you the knowledge and motivation to stick with fitness for the rest of your life.\\n\\n2\\n\\nFitness For Dummies, 3rd Edition\\n\\nFitness For Dummies, 3rd Edition, tells you the stuff you really want to know, such as:\\n\\n(cid:1) Will you burn more fat if you exercise at a slower pace? (cid:1) Which brands of home exercise equipment are most reliable? (cid:1) How do you know if a health club is trying to rip you off? (cid:1) Can you actually become “Rock Solid in 6 Weeks,” like the magazines say? (cid:1) Which weight-training exercises are best for beginners? (cid:1) What the heck is Pilates, and how do you pronounce it? (cid:1) How many days a week do you really need to work out? (cid:1) Is low-carb eating right for you?\\n\\nThe book is basic enough for the fitness rookie to understand, but it’s also useful for workout veterans who want to brush up on the latest fitness con- cepts, gadgets, or training techniques.\\n\\nConventions Used in This Book\\n\\nWe use few conventions in this book, because we want you to be able to pick it up and start anywhere. Two conventions to keep in mind are the following:\\n\\n(cid:1) New fitness jargon appears in italics, like this, along with a brief definition.\\n\\nUse these terms to impress your friends.\\n\\n(cid:1) Web sites appear in a special font, like this, to distinguish them from\\n\\nother text. Jump on over to your computer and check them out.\\n\\nWe also use the terms fitness routine, workout, exercise, and activity to mean the same thing: whatever you’re doing to raise your heart rate, build strength, or both.\\n\\nFoolish Assumptions\\n\\nWe make few assumptions about you, dear reader, but the first and most important is that you want to improve your fitness. You may be brand-new to working out and have questions ranging from how to get started to what shoes to buy. Or you may have been working out for years and are looking for advice on how to reinvigorate your routine. Or you may be returning to a healthier lifestyle after a few years in the recliner.\\n\\nIntroduction\\n\\n3\\n\\nWhatever your situation, this guide helps you make the best choices for your goals, lifestyle, and current fitness level. We give you step-by-step instruc- tions and explain fitness terminology so you don’t feel overwhelmed when talking to the salesperson trying to sell you a treadmill or a gym membership. (Added bonus: These terms come in handy if you find yourself at a dinner party with a bunch of personal trainers.) And we let you know when your sit- uation may benefit from the advice of a personal trainer, physician, or spe- cialized publication.\\n\\nHow This Book Is Organized\\n\\nFitness For Dummies, 3rd Edition, is divided into eight parts, and the chapters within each part cover specific topic areas in detail. You can read each chap- ter or part without having to read what came before, although we may refer you to other sections for more information about certain topics. Here’s a brief look at the eight parts.\\n\\nPart I: Getting Your Butt off the Couch\\n\\nIn this part, we give you the tools to start a fitness program. First, we give you an overview of the entire book, so you have a fast and easy way to under- stand the basics. Then, we discuss the important first steps in any fitness program, such as getting your fitness tested and setting realistic goals. We present strategies for making exercise a habit and explain the basics of healthy eating so you steer clear of fad diets and useless supplements. We also show you how to choose a personal trainer, should you decide to take that popular option.\\n\\nPart II: Enjoying Total-Body Health: Eating Well and Staying Injury-Free\\n\\nThis part covers everything everyone hopes to ignore about fitness: injuries, stretching, and nutrition. Sure, getting off the couch is critical to getting fit, but if you end up with an injury, you’ll be benched again before you know it. Stretching may not be pretty or exciting, but it’s one of the surest ways to ensure the long-term health of your muscles and joints. Finally, with so many differing opinions today about how to eat — low-carb, low-fat, carbo-loading, raw-foods-only — this part gives you the lowdown.\\n\\n4\\n\\nFitness For Dummies, 3rd Edition\\n\\nPart III: Getting to the Heart of the Matter\\n\\nThis part is devoted to cardiovascular exercise — the kind that strengthens your heart and lungs, burns lots of calories, lowers your stress level, and gives you the energy to chase down your cat for a bath. We tell you how long, how often, and how hard you need to work out in order to slim down, live longer, or train for a 10K run. We cover the most popular cardiovascular options, both indoor and outdoor, and offer tips on how to combat boredom when you’re walking, climbing, or pedaling in place.\\n\\nPart IV: Lift and Curl: Building a Stronger Bod with Weights\\n\\nIn this part we explain why everyone — whether you’re 18 years old or 80, male or female — ought to strength-train. We give you the know-how to get started and answer questions such as:\\n\\n(cid:1) What’s the difference between weight machines, dumbbells, and\\n\\nbarbells?\\n\\n(cid:1) How much weight should I lift? (cid:1) How many exercises should I do? (cid:1) What’s a deltoid, and why should I care?\\n\\nWe also updated the book by including a complete weight-training routine you can perform either at home or at the gym.\\n\\nPart V: Cardio-Strength Workouts: Getting the Best of Both Worlds\\n\\nIf you can combine cardio workouts with strength building, you’ve managed to get two workouts in one. One of the most popular cardio-strength work- outs is circuit training, in which you set up strength-building and cardio exer- cise stations, and walk or briskly run between each, giving you a total-body workout; in this part, you find a chapter devoted to circuit training. Yoga, one of the oldest forms of exercise in the world, is also discussed here, in its many forms and varieties. You also find out about hot, hot Pilates, a strength-and-cardio workout phenomenon.\\n\\nIntroduction\\n\\n5\\n\\nPart VI: Conquering the Gym (Even at Home)\\n\\nWalking into a health club can be a terrifying proposition, sort of like landing cold in some foreign country where you don’t know a soul, don’t speak the language, don’t know the customs, and feel like everyone’s staring at you. This part gives you the information you need to enter a gym with confidence. We explain how to choose a good club, fill you in on locker-room etiquette, and tell you how to get through an exercise class when you feel like you have two left feet that are tied together. We also update you on the latest in exercise classes, from spinning to treading to kickboxing.\\n\\nHealth clubs aren’t for everyone, so in this part, we also help you choose the best fitness equipment for your budget, your goals, and the size of your living room. We cover a wide range of equipment, from space-age treadmills to $3 rubber exercise tubes. We offer tips for designing your home gym so you’ll actually use the stuff you buy. And we tell you everything you ever wanted to know about exercise DVDs and videos.\\n\\nPart VII: Exercising for All Ages and Stages\\n\\nWorried about continuing your workouts during your pregnancy? Don’t be. This part helps calm your fears and gives you the basics on what to do — and what not to do — to keep you and your baby healthy. And to help get your kids off on the right fitness foot, this part shares some ways you can involve the whole family in fun activities, whether you’re the parent of a toddler or a teenager. If you’re moving into your senior years, this part is for you, too. Here, we show you how to get and stay fit into your 90s, so you can enjoy this golden time in your life.\\n\\nPart VIII: The Part of Tens\\n\\nEvery For Dummies book has a Part of Tens. These chapters give you a differ- ent spin on some of the information already presented in the other parts. For example, scattered throughout this book are many reasons to get and stay fit; in Chapter 24, you find a whole chapter of reasons. In Chapter 25, we tell you which low-priced fitness products we consider to be the best bargains. Conversely, in Chapter 26, we give you our picks for the worst fitness products and pills. Finally, in Chapter 27, we present ten tips for staying motivated.\\n\\n6\\n\\nFitness For Dummies, 3rd Edition\\n\\nIcons Used in This Book\\n\\nIcons are small pictures in the margins of this book that flag certain material for you. The following icons highlight information you want to pay special attention to.\\n\\nThis icon flags great strategies for getting in shape, such as recording your workouts in a daily log. We also use the target for money-saving tips, such as asking your health club to waive its initiation fee. It also highlights first-rate exercises and fitness products, from treadmills to stretching devices to nutri- tion newsletters.\\n\\nWhen information is just too good to forget, this icon helps you remember. This is the stuff you want to jot down and attach with a magnet to your fridge.\\n\\nWe use the Myth Buster superhero to dispel popular fitness myths. For exam- ple, in Chapter 8, we explain that exercise doesn’t have to hurt in order to be good for you. In Chapter 26, we explain that you can’t sweat off excess fat by wearing vinyl workout suits.\\n\\nThis icon warns you about hucksters who offer false promises, sell bogus products, or try to snare you with slimy sales tactics. We also use this icon to caution you about common exercise mistakes, such as neglecting to adjust the seat on an exercise machine.\\n\\nWe use this icon when we tell a story about our own adventures in fitness or recount the experiences of people we know. The anecdotes range from the wacky to the inspirational to the just plain helpful.\\n\\nWhere to Go from Here\\n\\nYou can dive into this book in two ways:\\n\\n(cid:1) If you want a crash course in fitness, read the book cover-to-cover. You’ll get a thorough understanding of what it takes to get in shape. And you’ll come across topics you may not have thought to look up, such as proper etiquette in the gym, how to judge the accuracy of fit- ness Web sites, and how often you need to buy new running shoes. (cid:1) If you want to find out about a specific topic, you can flip to that sec-\\n\\ntion and get your answers right away. Use the book as a reference every time you boldly enter uncharted territory, like a yoga class or the exercise aisle at your video store.\\n\\nPart I Getting Your Butt off the Couch\\n\\nIn this part . . . We help you get going on a fitness program, no\\n\\nmatter what shape you’re in.\\n\\nChapter 1 gives you a brief overview of the entire book, so that, if you’re short on time, you can get the quick-and- dirty lowdown on fitness. Chapter 2 explains the important first step toward getting fit: having your fitness tested. (Don’t worry — you can’t flunk!) Chapter 3 helps you devise a game plan: You find out how to set goals, track your progress, and use strategies to make exercise a habit. And because personal trainers are all the rage these days, Chapter 4 tells you how to choose one for yourself — and how much you can expect to pay.\\n\\nChapter 1 Fitness 101: Getting the Scoop\\n\\nIn This Chapter (cid:1) Getting ready for your first fitness test (cid:1) Deciding among your many choices of exercise routines (cid:1) Stretching well and eating right (cid:1) Working out while pregnant, in childhood, and into your senior years\\n\\nHome Time or This Old House, you’re pretending to get fit by reading this book!) While transforming yourself from couch potato to buff hottie doesn’t take a Ph.D. in physiology or kinesiology, you do need to follow a few rules of the road.\\n\\nIf you’re reading this chapter, you’ve decided to get fit. (Or, like wannabe\\n\\nhome remodelers who do nothing more than sit on the couch watching\\n\\nThis chapter outlines the very basics of getting fit. If you want to find out more, each section tells you which chapters to read for all the juicy details.\\n\\nYes, This Class Has Tests\\n\\nIn order to best determine how to reach your fitness goals, you first need to figure out where you are, physically. And the best way to do this is to sign up for a fitness evaluation (see Chapter 2), including a full health/fitness history and other important measures, such as the following:\\n\\n(cid:2) Resting heart rate: Also known as pulse, this test measures the number of times per minute your heart beats while you’re sitting down or in some other way relaxing. As you exercise more and more, your resting heart rate will likely drop.\\n\\n(cid:2) Heart rate after physical activity: Generally, you exercise for about 15 minutes on a treadmill or stationary bicycle and test your pulse. Cardio exercises (discussed in Chapter 8) can gradually lower this number.\\n\\n10 Part I: Getting Your Butt off the Couch\\n\\n(cid:2) Blood pressure: This test measures how hard your heart has to work to pump blood through your blood vessels. Cardio activities (see Chapter 8) can help alleviate high blood pressure (hypertension), which can lead to health problems.\\n\\n(cid:2) Percentage of body fat: Instead of measuring how much you weigh,\\n\\nwhich doesn’t necessarily indicate how fit you are, measuring your body fat tells you how much of you is fat and how much is muscle, bones, blood, organs, and other tissues. Up to a point, the lower the number, the better; reducing your body fat is often a matter of eating better (discussed in Chapter 7) and burning calories through cardio workouts (see Chapter 8) and lifting weights (see Chapter 11).\\n\\n(cid:2) Strength: This tests measures the strength of your upper body, abdomi- nal muscles, and lower body by doing sit-ups, push-ups, leg extensions (on a weight machine), and so on. Weight lifting, described in Chapter 11, helps improve your strength.\\n\\n(cid:2) Flexibility: Because flexibility is the downfall of even the super-fit, make sure your evaluation measures the range of motion of your joints and muscles. Chapter 6 gives you the lowdown on stretching, which is one of the best ways to improve your flexibility.\\n\\nEach of these tests can be done by a physician, a personal trainer, or a fitness professional working at a gym. But don’t spend any time studying for them: You can’t fail these tests. Think of them more as baseline measurements that help you decide where to put your emphasis: improving the health of your heart, losing weight and reducing body fat, building strength, improving your flexibility, and so on.\\n\\nChoosing Your Weapon\\n\\nWith so many workout options available these days, you have plenty of fitness weapons from which to choose. Your workout options tend to fall into three categories, however: cardio, strength, and combination workouts. The three following sections give you a brief overview of each.\\n\\nSeeing into the heart of the matter\\n\\nWorkouts that get your heart pumping are known as cardio (short for cardio- vascular) exercises, and these improve the health of your heart and blood vessels. Cardio workouts also burn calories, which helps you lose weight. Check out Chapter 8 for a cardio primer.\\n\\nChapter 1: Fitness 101: Getting the Scoop\\n\\n11\\n\\nThe simplest — and, perhaps, the cheapest — cardio exercise is walking. Other popular cardio exercises include running, cycling, in-line skating, swimming, rowing, and (if you live in a snowy winter climate) snowshoeing and cross- country skiing. Chapter 10 discusses many of these outdoor cardio activities and gives you pointers for developing good techniques for each.\\n\\nYou don’t have to brave the outdoors to get a cardio workout, however. Chapter 9 discusses indoor cardio machines, including treadmills, elliptical trainers, stationary bikes, stair-climbers, and rowing machines.\\n\\nGetting buff with weights\\n\\nMany men focus heavily on weight training, while some women shy away from it. The truth is that both men and women need to do some strength training (along with some cardio workouts, discussed in the preceding section, to get the heart and blood vessels into tip-top shape) for one impor- tant reason: to help burn more calories. Strange as it seems, weightlifting improves your resting metabolism, which means you turn into a fat- and calorie-burning machine. Chapter 11 shares this and many other reasons to start pumping iron.\\n\\nCardio and strength together: Two for the price of one\\n\\nA few activities combine cardio and strength training into one workout. One of the most popular, circuit training (see Chapter 15), combines a cardio warm-up and cooldown with a series of weight-lifting and other strength stations. Not only can circuit training save you time, but it’s also a lot of fun, because you move from station to station every 30 or 40 seconds.\\n\\nTwo other popular strength-cardio exercises are yoga and Pilates, which tend to focus on core strength, the strength and flexibility of your midsection. Discussed in Chapters 16 and 17, respectively, yoga and Pilates can be high- energy, revved-up workouts or soothing, mind-body workouts that leave you feeling refreshed.\\n\\nStretching Your Mind (and Body)\\n\\nDon’t let recent headlines claiming there’s no correlation between stretching and injuries fool you: If you stretch properly and do it after (not before) you work out, studies show that you reduce your risk of injury. (But do take care\\n\\n12 Part I: Getting Your Butt off the Couch\\n\\nthat you perform some flexibility movement prep before your workout — see Chapter 6.) And the bottom line is that you want to avoid injuries, because they keep you from working out as often and as intensely as you’d like. We offer you an entire chapter on stretching (see Chapter 6), plus a short chap- ter on avoiding common injuries (see Chapter 5).\\n\\nYoga, discussed in Chapter 16, is an excellent way to improve your flexibility.\\n\\nWhat Are You Eating?\\n\\nThe link between exercise and nutrition has been clear for decades, and you’re likely to have trouble improving your fitness if you make poor nutritional choices. But how do you know which choices to make? Low fat? High carb? Low carb? High protein? Low calorie? Food pyramids? Hydration? Vitamins? It’s enough to make your head spin.\\n\\nKnowing what to eat for optimal fitness has never been a murkier proposition. Fortunately, in Chapter 7, we guide you through the haze, giving you a clear picture of the benefits of a low-fat, low-bad-carb, high-good-carb, moderate- protein, Mediterranean-food-pyramid, lots-o-water, balanced diet. Flip to that chapter when you’re ready to get the final scoop on nutrition — final for based on current scientific research, that is.\\n\\nAt Home or at the Gym — Choosing What’s Best for You\\n\\nTo join or not to join, that is the fitness question everyone asks himself at some point. Joining a gym can be a big financial investment, and many people choose not to join for that reason, opting for the free activities (walking, run- ning, cycling) available just by walking out your front door.\\n\\nBut gyms have plenty to offer, including the latest and greatest workout equipment, fun and invigorating classes, the opportunity to schedule time with a personal trainer, and the infectious energy of other gym members. Chapter 18 gives you step-by-step instructions for how to scout out and decide whether to join a local gym and offers a basic lesson in gym etiquette. Chapter 19 offers practical advice on deciding whether to join an exercise class or purchase a DVD to use at home.\\n\\nChapter 1: Fitness 101: Getting the Scoop\\n\\n13\\n\\nA gym isn’t the only place to use exercise equipment. If you have the money to invest in your own equipment, you can set up your own home gym in your basement, spare room, garage, or any other convenient area. Chapter 20 helps you plan your space and make the most of your fitness equipment shopping excursions; Chapter 25 offers ten low-cost fitness investments for your home.\\n\\nSpecial Exercises for Special People\\n\\nFitness isn’t only for those buff, 20-something gyms gods. In fact, you can start exercising in your 80s and still reap the benefits of a healthier, longer life. And the earlier in life you start working out, the more likely it will become a lifelong habit. Chapter 23 offers some tips and advice for beginning an exer- cise program in your senior years.\\n\\nHow early is early enough? How about the womb? One study shows that women who exercise during pregnancy have leaner babies who turn into leaner kids. The benefits aren’t only for the kids, however. From reducing back pain and encouraging better sleep patterns to encountering an easier delivery to slipping back into your old jeans more quickly, exercising during pregnancy offers incredible health benefits. See Chapter 21 for a short tutor- ial on getting and staying fit during pregnancy. For an in-depth look at preg- nancy workouts, check out Fit Pregnancy For Dummies by Catherine Cram and Tere Stouffer Drenth (published by Wiley).\\n\\nKids, perhaps more than any other age group, understand that being active is fun. If you can tap into their natural love of activities, especially games, sports, and dancing, you can help your kids avoid the alarming rates of obesity that plague children today. Without emphasizing “exercise” or “workouts,” you can introduce your child to all sorts of healthy activities that encourage a lifelong fitness. Keep the emphasis on fun, without pushing your child into competitions or activities she doesn’t enjoy, and you’ll help your child become an adult with a strong body and a healthy heart.\\n\\n14 Part I: Getting Your Butt off the Couch\\n\\nChapter 2 Testing Your Fitness\\n\\nIn This Chapter (cid:1) Reviewing your health history (cid:1) Determining your heart rate and blood pressure (cid:1) Surveying your heart and lungs (cid:1) Scrutinizing your body fat (cid:1) Measuring your strength and flexibility\\n\\nevaluated. Don’t panic. This test isn’t like your driver’s license renewal exam: You can’t flunk, and you don’t have to stand in line for three hours listening to people rant and rave about government bureaucracy. A fitness test simply gives you key information about your physical condition.\\n\\nWe’ve never been fond of tests that you can’t study for. Nevertheless,\\n\\nwe think the first step toward getting in shape is having your fitness\\n\\nWe constantly hear people say, “I’m so out of shape. I need to lose weight.” But that’s like telling a travel agent, “I’m in Europe. I need to go to Africa.” Your travel agent needs to know the specifics: Are you in Rome? Berlin? Moscow? Do you want to go to Cairo? Cape Town? The Kalahari Desert? Before you embark on a fitness program, you need to know your starting point with the same sort of precision. A fitness evaluation gives you impor- tant departure information, such as your heart rate, body fat, strength, and flexibility. Armed with these facts, you or your trainer can design an intelli- gent plan to get you to your fitness destination. And when you get there, you’ll have the numbers to prove just how far you’ve come.\\n\\nIn this chapter, we describe what to expect when a professional tests your fit- ness. We also explain how to test your fitness on your own. However, even if you do most of the testing yourself, consider getting certain aspects of your fitness evaluated at a sports medicine clinic or fitness center. As you com- plete the various tests, record your results on the chart found at the end of this chapter.\\n\\n16 Part I: Getting Your Butt off the Couch\\n\\nWhat’s Your Health History?\\n\\nWhen you join a gym, one of the first things you should be asked to do — after signing your check, of course — is to fill out a health-history question- naire. Your answers to these questions give a snapshot of your overall well- being, including your eating and exercise habits, your risk for developing cardiovascular disease, and any orthopedic limitations or medical conditions that you may have. Typical questions include: Do you have any chronic joint problems such as arthritis? Do you have a high stress level? Are you currently taking any over-the-counter or prescription medications?\\n\\nIf you don’t belong to a gym, ask yourself the following questions, which are designed to indicate your risk of developing heart disease:\\n\\n(cid:2) Are you inactive? (cid:2) Do you have a history of heart disease? (cid:2) Do you have diabetes or high blood sugar? (cid:2) Do you have a history of high blood pressure? (cid:2) Did your mother, father, sister, or brother develop any form of\\n\\nheart disease before age 50?\\n\\n(cid:2) Do you smoke cigarettes, or have you quit within the last two years? (cid:2) Do you have high cholesterol — either total cholesterol higher than 200\\n\\nmg/dl or HDL less than 40 mg/dl?\\n\\nIf you answer “yes” to at least one question and you’re over age 35, see a physician for a complete medical evaluation before you even pursue a fitness testing session. A physician is the only one who can accurately determine whether exercising puts you in any danger. If you answer “yes” to two or more questions, get a checkup no matter how old you are.\\n\\nSome gyms request that you be tested by a physician if a staff member feels you may have a medical problem. Don’t groan; a request like this indicates that your gym is on the ball. Some health clubs just want your money. They may not require any testing — other than the test that determines whether you can sign your name on a credit-card slip. If that’s the case, you need to take responsibility for getting tested.\\n\\nAfter you fill out your questionnaire, your tester should discuss the answers with you and ask for more information if necessary. If you’re a smoker, for example, he may ask you how much you smoke. Respond honestly and thor- oughly. Don’t say that you run 5 miles a day if you haven’t broken a sweat since high school — or if you intend to run every day but just haven’t gotten around to it.\\n\\nChapter 2: Testing Your Fitness\\n\\n17\\n\\nLet your tester judge what’s important. Liz tested two men who failed to tell her that they’d each had a lung removed. Another client neglected to men- tion that he had serious congenital heart problems. Two weeks later, he passed out while running on the treadmill and hit his head on the way down, causing a life-threatening head injury. Lucky for him, an ambulance arrived within five minutes, and the paramedics were able to save him.\\n\\nWhat’s Your Heart Rate?\\n\\nYour heart rate, also known as your pulse, is the number of times your heart beats per minute. Your fitness evaluation should include a measure of your resting heart rate — your heart rate when you’re sitting still. Ideally, your rest- ing heart rate should be between 60 and 90 beats per minute. It may be slower if you’re fit or genetically predisposed to a low heart rate; it may be faster if you’re nervous or have recently downed three double cappuccinos. In addi- tion to caffeine, stress and certain medications can speed up your heart rate. To be sure, take your heart rate first thing in the morning for three consecu- tive days and find the average to determine your heart rate.\\n\\nAfter a month or two of regular exercise, your resting heart rate usually drops. This means that your heart has become more efficient. It may need to beat only 80 times per minute to pump the same amount of blood (or more) than it used to pump in 90 beats. In the long run, this saves wear and tear on your heart.\\n\\nThe simplest place to take your own pulse is at your wrist. Rest your middle and index fingertips (not your thumb) lightly on your opposite wrist, directly below the base of your thumb. Most people can see the faint bluish line of their radial artery; place your fingertips here. Count the beats for 1 minute. Or, if you have a short attention span, count for 30 seconds and multiply by 2. For a really, really short attention span, count for 6 seconds and multiply by 10. An even easier and faster way to measure your pulse is to strap on a heart-rate monitor, an extremely useful gadget we describe in Chapter 8.\\n\\nWhat’s Your Blood Pressure?\\n\\nHave a professional test your blood pressure. Home blood-pressure machines tend to be inaccurate, as do those contraptions in the mall that charge a quarter for a reading.\\n\\nBlood pressure is a measurement of how open your blood vessels are. Low numbers mean that your heart doesn’t have to work very hard to pump the blood through your blood vessels. Ideally, your blood pressure should read 115/75 or below, a lower standard than the old standby of 120/80. If it’s\\n\\n18 Part I: Getting Your Butt off the Couch\\n\\nslightly higher, don’t get stressed (that only increases it even more). However, if your blood pressure is higher than 140/90, you are considered hypertensive, a fancy term for having high blood pressure. In case you’re wondering, the top number, called your systolic blood pressure, measures pressure as your heart ejects blood. The bottom number, your diastolic blood pressure, mea- sures pressure when your heart relaxes and prepares for its next pump.\\n\\nIf you get a high blood-pressure reading, ask your tester to try again. The numbers can be affected by many factors, such as illness, caffeine, nervous- ness, or racing into your test because you were late. But if you repeatedly get high readings, see a doctor.\\n\\nHow Fit Is Your Heart?\\n\\nMost reputable clubs perform something called a submax test. That’s short for submaximal test, fitness jargon for a test that evaluates your heart rate when you’re working at less than your maximum effort. Typically, this test takes you to about 75 to 85 percent of your maximum heart rate. A maximal test — in which you go all-out — should only be performed by a physician or in the presence of a physician.\\n\\nSubmaximal tests are usually performed on a stationary bicycle, treadmill, or step bench. (If you’re a runner, request a treadmill; if you’re a cyclist, ask to be tested on a bike. You’re best at what you practice most.) The test usually lasts about 15 minutes. During this time, you increase your intensity every three or four minutes while the tester monitors your heart rate and blood pressure. The test shouldn’t be very hard. On a bike, the worst it should feel like is pedaling up a moderately steep hill for a few minutes.\\n\\nIf you don’t belong to a health club, you can test your aerobic fitness using a watch with a second hand and a course that’s exactly 1 mile long. Warm up with a slow walk for five to ten minutes, and then time yourself as you walk or run the mile as briskly as you can. Take your pulse right before you stop, and make a mental note of the number. Also note your time as you complete your mile.\\n\\nOne minute after you finish the mile, take your pulse again. See how far it has dropped from the pulse check you did right at the end of your walk. Try this test again in two months and see how much faster you can complete the mile and how much more quickly you recover. If a mile sounds like too much for you right now, do a half-mile or even walk around the block. Just choose a distance that you can measure again at a later date.\\n\\nSchedule a second fitness evaluation in six weeks. Those first weeks of train- ing can bring about some dramatic changes, and it’s really motivating to see how well you’ve done. After that, changes tend to be steady but somewhat slower. Get tested again every three to six months. Don’t go longer than a\\n\\nChapter 2: Testing Your Fitness\\n\\n19\\n\\nyear without reevaluating your progress. You don’t want to waste time with a workout program that’s not getting results.\\n\\nHow Much of You Is Fat?\\n\\nDuring your evaluation, your tester will probably weigh you. Just know that your weight is of limited value. When you hop on a scale, you learn the grand total weight of your bones, organs, blood, fat, muscle, and other tissues. This number can be misleading because muscle weighs more per square inch than fat.\\n\\nConsider two men who stand 5\\'8\" and weigh 190 pounds. One guy may be a lean bodybuilder who has a lot of muscle packed onto his frame. Another guy may be a couch potato whose gut hangs 4 inches over his belt buckle. Even a low weight doesn’t necessarily indicate good health or fitness. It may simply mean that you have small bones and little muscle.\\n\\nMore helpful than your body weight is your body composition — how much of your body is composed of fat and how much is composed of everything else. Your body composition is also called your body-fat percentage. If you score a 25 percent on a fat test, this means that 25 percent of your weight is composed of fat.\\n\\nLike your weight, your body-fat percentage is not necessarily a measure of your health. True, cardiovascular disease, diabetes, and certain cancers are more prevalent among overweight people — men who have more than about 20 percent body fat and women who have more than about 30 percent body fat. However, some researchers believe that these health problems are not caused by the extra fat itself but rather by a lack of exercise and a poor diet. In other words, if you exercise regularly and eat well, extra body fat may not compromise your health. So consider your body-fat score in a context with other health measures, such as your cholesterol levels, blood pressure, and other gauges of fitness, such as a submaximal test and your resting heart rate.\\n\\nAn additional number to consider is the circumference of your waist. Excess abdominal fat — the type that lies deep in your belly, clumped around your organs — is linked to increased risk for heart disease. Heavy thighs, on the other hand, do not appear to be related to health problems. (In other words — to use terms we can all relate to — a beer belly is more harmful to your health than saddlebags.) Men with waist measurements greater than 40 and women with waist measurements greater than 35 should consult a physician.\\n\\nAlthough body fat testing has its limits, your results can give you great insight into how your fat-loss and exercise program is coming along. Sure, your scale can tell you that you lost 7 pounds. But a body-fat test can tell you that your 7-pound loss means that you lost 10 pounds of fat and gained 3 pounds of muscle, results that are probably more motivating.\\n\\n20 Part I: Getting Your Butt off the Couch\\n\\nBody-fat testing also can tell you if you have too little fat. Maybe you can never be too rich, but you definitely can be too thin. For women, super-low body fat — below about 16 percent — may lead to problems such as irregular menstrual periods, permanent bone loss, and a high rate of bone fractures.\\n\\nKeep in mind that every body-fat testing method has room for error. At a recent fitness convention, Suzanne had her body fat measured by two different methods — and appeared to have gained 11 percent body fat in a matter of 15 minutes. You may even get wildly different readings using the same test, depending on the skill of the tester or the condition of the equipment.\\n\\nThe only way to measure body fat with complete accuracy is to burn yourself up and take a carbon count of the ashes. Because that technique doesn’t draw too many volunteers, scientists have developed a number of other methods. Here’s a look at the ones you’re most likely to come across.\\n\\nPinching an inch\\n\\nThe most common body-fat test uses the skinfold caliper, a gizmo that resem- bles a stun gun with salad tongs attached (see Figure 2-1). When your tester fires, the tongs pinch your skin, pulling your fat away from your muscles and bones. (You feel moderate discomfort, like when your great aunt pinches your cheek on the holidays.) Typically, the tester pinches three to seven dif- ferent sites on your body, such as your abdomen, the back of your arm, and the back of your shoulder. The thickness of each pinch is plugged into a for- mula to determine your body-fat percentage. Your tester should pinch each site two or three times to verify the measurement.\\n\\nMany things can go wrong with a caliper test. The tester may not pinch exactly the right spot, or he may not pull all the fat away from the bone. Or he may pinch too hard and accidentally yank some of your muscle. Also, research suggests that certain formulas are more accurate for certain ethnic groups, age ranges, and fitness levels.\\n\\nExperts give this test a margin of error of four points, meaning your actual body-fat percentage could be four points higher or lower than it actually is. Be sure to get tested before your workout. When you exercise, blood travels to your skin to cool you down. This can cause your skin to swell, and you may test fatter than you really are. Plus, calipers can slip if your skin is wet from sweat.\\n\\nIf you want to try this method on your own, you can purchase calipers such as Accu-Measure (available for about $20 through Collage Video, a company you can visit at www.collagevideo.com and that’s described in Chapter 19). These calipers come with a decent booklet that explains how to test yourself and interpret the results. For better accuracy, you may want to have a friend perform the test on you.\\n\\nChapter 2: Testing Your Fitness\\n\\n21\\n\\nFigure 2-1: Getting pinched with calipers.\\n\\nPhotograph by Jennifer Lawler\\n\\nTaking your measurements\\n\\nA less precise but also helpful way to keep track of your body fat is to take your measurements. You don’t get a percentage, but you can use the num- bers to keep track of inches lost (or gained, if you’re trying to pack on muscle), which can be motivating in and of itself. If you’re losing inches, chances are, you’re dropping body fat. Some common places to measure include across the middle of your chest, the center of your upper arm, the smallest part of your waist, the widest part of your hips, the widest part of your thigh, and the widest part of your ankle. You can write these numbers on the chart at the end of this chapter.\\n\\nCalculating your body mass index\\n\\nYet another method of estimating how “fat” you are is body mass index (BMI), a number derived from your height and weight. To determine your BMI, turn to Table 2-1, locate your height in inches, and then move across that row until you find your weight. The number at the top of that column is your BMI.\\n\\n22 Part I: Getting Your Butt off the Couch\\n\\n5 3\\n\\n7 6 1\\n\\n3 7 1\\n\\n9 7 1\\n\\n5 8 1\\n\\n1 9 1\\n\\n7 9 1\\n\\n4 0 2\\n\\n0 1 2\\n\\n6 1 2\\n\\n3 2 2\\n\\n0 3 2\\n\\n6 3 2\\n\\n3 4 2\\n\\n0 5 2\\n\\n8 5 2\\n\\n5 6 2\\n\\n2 7 2\\n\\n9 7 2\\n\\n7 8 2\\n\\n4 3\\n\\n2 6 1\\n\\n8 6 1\\n\\n4 7 1\\n\\n0 8 1\\n\\n6 8 1\\n\\n1 9 1\\n\\n7 9 1\\n\\n4 0 2\\n\\n0 1 2\\n\\n7 1 2\\n\\n3 2 2\\n\\n0 3 2\\n\\n6 3 2\\n\\n3 4 2\\n\\n0 5 2\\n\\n7 5 2\\n\\n4 6 2\\n\\n2 7 2\\n\\n9 7 2\\n\\n3 3\\n\\n8 5 1\\n\\n3 6 1\\n\\n8 6 1\\n\\n4 7 1\\n\\n0 8 1\\n\\n6 8 1\\n\\n2 9 1\\n\\n8 9 1\\n\\n4 0 2\\n\\n1 1 2\\n\\n6 1 2\\n\\n3 2 2\\n\\n9 2 2\\n\\n6 3 2\\n\\n2 4 2\\n\\n0 5 2\\n\\n6 5 2\\n\\n4 6 2\\n\\n1 7 2\\n\\n2 3\\n\\n3 5 1\\n\\n8 5 1\\n\\n3 6 1\\n\\n9 6 1\\n\\n5 7 1\\n\\n0 8 1\\n\\n6 8 1\\n\\n2 9 1\\n\\n8 9 1\\n\\n4 0 2\\n\\n0 1 2\\n\\n6 1 2\\n\\n2 2 2\\n\\n9 2 2\\n\\n5 3 2\\n\\n2 4 2\\n\\n9 4 2\\n\\n6 5 2\\n\\n3 6 2\\n\\n1 3\\n\\n8 4 1\\n\\n3 5 1\\n\\n8 5 1\\n\\n4 6 1\\n\\n9 6 1\\n\\n5 7 1\\n\\n0 8 1\\n\\n6 8 1\\n\\n2 9 1\\n\\n8 9 1\\n\\n3 0 2\\n\\n9 0 2\\n\\n6 1 2\\n\\n2 2 2\\n\\n8 2 2\\n\\n5 3 2\\n\\n1 4 2\\n\\n8 4 2\\n\\n4 5 2\\n\\n0 3\\n\\n3 4 1\\n\\n8 4 1\\n\\n3 5 1\\n\\n8 5 1\\n\\n4 6 1\\n\\n9 6 1\\n\\n4 7 1\\n\\n0 8 1\\n\\n6 8 1\\n\\n1 9 1\\n\\n7 9 1\\n\\n3 0 2\\n\\n9 0 2\\n\\n5 1 2\\n\\n1 2 2\\n\\n7 2 2\\n\\n3 3 2\\n\\n0 4 2\\n\\n6 4 2\\n\\n9 2\\n\\n8 3 1\\n\\n3 4 1\\n\\n8 4 1\\n\\n3 5 1\\n\\n8 5 1\\n\\n3 6 1\\n\\n9 6 1\\n\\n4 7 1\\n\\n9 7 1\\n\\n5 8 1\\n\\n0 9 1\\n\\n6 9 1\\n\\n2 0 2\\n\\n8 0 2\\n\\n3 1 2\\n\\n9 1 2\\n\\n5 2 2\\n\\n2 3 2\\n\\n8 3 2\\n\\nx e d n I s s a M y d o B\\n\\n8 2\\n\\n7 2\\n\\n6 2\\n\\n4 3 1\\n\\n9 2 1\\n\\n4 2 1\\n\\n8 3 1\\n\\n3 3 1\\n\\n8 2 1\\n\\n3 4 1\\n\\n8 3 1\\n\\n3 3 1\\n\\n8 4 1\\n\\n3 4 1\\n\\n7 3 1\\n\\n3 5 1\\n\\n7 4 1\\n\\n2 4 1\\n\\n8 5 1\\n\\n2 5 1\\n\\n6 4 1\\n\\n3 6 1\\n\\n7 5 1\\n\\n1 5 1\\n\\n8 6 1\\n\\n2 6 1\\n\\n6 5 1\\n\\n3 7 1\\n\\n7 6 1\\n\\n1 6 1\\n\\n8 7 1\\n\\n2 7 1\\n\\n6 6 1\\n\\n4 8 1\\n\\n7 7 1\\n\\n1 7 1\\n\\n9 8 1\\n\\n2 8 1\\n\\n6 7 1\\n\\n5 9 1\\n\\n8 8 1\\n\\n1 8 1\\n\\n0 0 2\\n\\n3 9 1\\n\\n6 8 1\\n\\n6 0 2\\n\\n9 9 1\\n\\n1 9 1\\n\\n2 1 2\\n\\n4 0 2\\n\\n7 9 1\\n\\n8 1 2\\n\\n0 1 2\\n\\n2 0 2\\n\\n4 2 2\\n\\n6 1 2\\n\\n8 0 2\\n\\n0 3 2\\n\\n1 2 2\\n\\n3 1 2\\n\\n5 2\\n\\n9 1 1\\n\\n4 2 1\\n\\n8 2 1\\n\\n2 3 1\\n\\n6 3 1\\n\\n1 4 1\\n\\n5 4 1\\n\\n0 5 1\\n\\n5 5 1\\n\\n9 5 1\\n\\n4 6 1\\n\\n9 6 1\\n\\n4 7 1\\n\\n9 7 1\\n\\n4 8 1\\n\\n9 8 1\\n\\n4 9 1\\n\\n0 0 2\\n\\n5 0 2\\n\\n1 - 2 e l b a T\\n\\n4 2\\n\\n3 2\\n\\n2 2\\n\\n1 2\\n\\n0 2\\n\\n9 1\\n\\nI\\n\\nM B\\n\\nt h g i e W\\n\\ny d o B\\n\\nt h g i e H\\n\\n) s d n u o p (\\n\\n) s e h c n i (\\n\\n5 1 1\\n\\n0 1 1\\n\\n5 0 1\\n\\n0 0 1\\n\\n6 9\\n\\n1 9\\n\\n8 5\\n\\n9 1 1\\n\\n4 1 1\\n\\n9 0 1\\n\\n4 0 1\\n\\n9 9\\n\\n4 9\\n\\n9 5\\n\\n3 2 1\\n\\n8 1 1\\n\\n2 1 1\\n\\n7 0 1\\n\\n2 0 1\\n\\n7 9\\n\\n0 6\\n\\n7 2 1\\n\\n2 2 1\\n\\n6 1 1\\n\\n1 1 1\\n\\n6 0 1\\n\\n0 0 1\\n\\n1 6\\n\\n1 3 1\\n\\n6 2 1\\n\\n0 2 1\\n\\n5 1 1\\n\\n9 0 1\\n\\n4 0 1\\n\\n2 6\\n\\n5 3 1\\n\\n0 3 1\\n\\n4 2 1\\n\\n8 1 1\\n\\n3 1 1\\n\\n7 0 1\\n\\n3 6\\n\\n0 4 1\\n\\n4 3 1\\n\\n8 2 1\\n\\n2 2 1\\n\\n6 1 1\\n\\n0 1 1\\n\\n4 6\\n\\n4 4 1\\n\\n8 3 1\\n\\n2 3 1\\n\\n6 2 1\\n\\n0 2 1\\n\\n4 1 1\\n\\n5 6\\n\\n8 4 1\\n\\n2 4 1\\n\\n6 3 1\\n\\n0 3 1\\n\\n4 2 1\\n\\n8 1 1\\n\\n6 6\\n\\n3 5 1\\n\\n6 4 1\\n\\n0 4 1\\n\\n4 3 1\\n\\n7 2 1\\n\\n1 2 1\\n\\n7 6\\n\\n8 5 1\\n\\n1 5 1\\n\\n4 4 1\\n\\n8 3 1\\n\\n1 3 1\\n\\n5 2 1\\n\\n8 6\\n\\n2 6 1\\n\\n5 5 1\\n\\n9 4 1\\n\\n2 4 1\\n\\n5 3 1\\n\\n8 2 1\\n\\n9 6\\n\\n7 6 1\\n\\n0 6 1\\n\\n3 5 1\\n\\n6 4 1\\n\\n9 3 1\\n\\n2 3 1\\n\\n0 7\\n\\n2 7 1\\n\\n5 6 1\\n\\n7 5 1\\n\\n0 5 1\\n\\n3 4 1\\n\\n6 3 1\\n\\n1 7\\n\\n7 7 1\\n\\n9 6 1\\n\\n2 6 1\\n\\n4 5 1\\n\\n7 4 1\\n\\n0 4 1\\n\\n2 7\\n\\n2 8 1\\n\\n4 7 1\\n\\n6 6 1\\n\\n9 5 1\\n\\n1 5 1\\n\\n4 4 1\\n\\n3 7\\n\\n6 8 1\\n\\n9 7 1\\n\\n1 7 1\\n\\n3 6 1\\n\\n5 5 1\\n\\n8 4 1\\n\\n4 7\\n\\n2 9 1\\n\\n4 8 1\\n\\n6 7 1\\n\\n8 6 1\\n\\n0 6 1\\n\\n2 5 1\\n\\n5 7\\n\\n7 9 1\\n\\n9 8 1\\n\\n0 8 1\\n\\n2 7 1\\n\\n4 6 1\\n\\n6 5 1\\n\\n6 7\\n\\n) I\\n\\nB L H N\\n\\n( e t u t i t s n I d o o B d n a\\n\\nl\\n\\n,\\n\\ng n u L , t r a e H\\n\\nl\\n\\na n o i t a N\\n\\n:\\n\\ne c r u o S\\n\\nChapter 2: Testing Your Fitness\\n\\n23\\n\\nIf you’re in the mood to pull out your calculator, you can determine your BMI by following these steps:\\n\\n1. Multiply your height in inches times your height in inches.\\n\\n2. Divide your weight by the number you arrived at in Step 1.\\n\\n3. Multiply the number you came up with in Step 2 by 705.\\n\\nThe result is your BMI.\\n\\nSo what does your BMI mean? The National Institutes of Health has issued the BMI guidelines shown in Table 2-2.\\n\\nTable 2-2\\n\\nUnderstanding Your Body Mass Index\\n\\nBMI\\n\\nWeight Status\\n\\nLess than 19\\n\\nUnderweight\\n\\n19 to 24.9\\n\\nHealthy\\n\\n25 to 29.9\\n\\nOverweight\\n\\n30 or greater\\n\\nObese\\n\\nPeople with a BMI of 25 or above are considered at higher risk for heart dis- ease, stroke, hypertension, diabetes, gallbladder disease, cancer, and death. But these guidelines are controversial. Even members of the government panel that issued the guidelines believe that setting the low point for over- weight at a BMI of 25 is somewhat arbitrary. Keep in mind that BMI, like body- fat percentage, is only one factor in assessing your health. Also know that BMI measurements for extremely muscular athletes and pregnant women are not very accurate.\\n\\nYou may wonder: If BMI has so many limitations, why are we including it in this book? Because it’s the simplest way — no fees, no equipment, and no schlepping to the health club — of estimating whether you may be in the overweight ballpark.\\n\\nGetting zapped (also body-fat scales and handheld testers)\\n\\nAnother common method of body fat testing is called bioelectrical impedance analysis (BIA). You lie on your back while a signal travels from an electrode on your foot to an electrode on your hand. The slower the signal, the more\\n\\n24 Part I: Getting Your Butt off the Couch\\n\\nfat you have. This is because fat impedes, or blocks, the signal. The signal travels quickly through muscle because muscle is 70 percent water and water conducts electricity. Fat, on the other hand, is just 5 to 13 percent water.\\n\\nSimilar technology is used in body-fat scales and handheld gadgets that resemble a car steering wheel and are even less accurate than BIA.\\n\\nBioelectrical impedance can have a huge margin of error, especially if you’re extremely fat or extremely lean. In one study, world-class female distance runners were found to average 20 percent body fat, when more reliable meth- ods actually show that they were closer to 10 percent. Dehydration also can skew the results wildly; the signal slows down, and you appear to have more fat than you really do. Don’t drink alcohol or caffeine for at least 24 hours before the test because they can lead to dehydration.\\n\\nGetting dunked (underwater weighing)\\n\\nUnderwater weighing is the most cumbersome method of body-fat testing, but it’s also the most accurate method that’s anywhere near affordable. You sit on a scale in a tank of warm water about the size of a Jacuzzi. (When Suzanne did this, she felt like a giant piece of tortellini floating in a big pot.) Then comes the unnerving part: You blow all the air out of your lungs and bend forward until you’re completely submerged. If there’s air trapped in your lungs, you score fatter than you really are. Knowing this fact makes you try really, really hard to blow out your air, which makes you feel like you’re about to explode. You stay submerged for about five seconds while your underwater weight registers on a digital scale. The result is then plugged into a mathematical equation.\\n\\nThis method of testing is based on the premise that muscle sinks and fat floats. The more fat you have, the more your body wants to float when dunked under water. The denser you are, the more you sink, and the more water your body displaces.\\n\\nThe margin of error for this test is 2 to 2.5 percent for young to middle-aged adults. The results are less accurate for children, older adults, and extremely lean people. This is because lean body tissue is made up of other things besides muscle. Bone, for example, isn’t fully formed in children, and it may be somewhat porous in older adults and somewhat denser in super-fit people. You can get this test done at sophisticated sports-medicine clinics or labs for $50 to $100.\\n\\nChapter 2: Testing Your Fitness\\n\\n25\\n\\nBOD POD: The cutting edge of body-fat testing\\n\\nUnderwater weighing has long been the standard for body-fat testing, but a sophisticated contraption called the BOD POD may one day replace it. The BOD POD is a 5-foot-tall fiberglass chamber that looks like a giant egg with a tinted window. You sit in the chamber for two or three 50-second tests while computerized pressure sensors determine how much air your body displaces — in other words, how much space you take up. (Underwater weigh- ing determines the same information, just in a way that’s less convenient.)\\n\\nResearch suggests that the BOD POD may be as accurate as underwater weighing, but the technology is so new that only a few studies have been conducted. Although the machine costs about as much as a luxury car, at universities, fitness expos, and some health clubs around the country, you can get a BOD POD test for about $25.\\n\\nDEXA: X-ray vision\\n\\nAnother method is Dual-Energy X-ray Absorptiometry (DEXA). Not only does it measure how much fat you have, but it also determines where the fat is located on your body, a more relevant health indicator. Originally developed to scan bone density, DEXA is available at hospitals and in doctors’ offices; it usually requires a physician’s referral. (The test costs from $150 to $200.) You lie on a bed while low doses of two different X-ray energies scan your body from head to toe.\\n\\nHow Strong Are You?\\n\\nFear not: You won’t be required to do one-arm push-ups or lift a barbell that weighs more than your dad. Strength tests, like the other tests that we describe in this chapter, are simply designed to give you a starting point. If you get started on a good weight-lifting program and stick to it, you’re likely to see dramatic changes when you take another fitness test in two or three months.\\n\\nMost health clubs don’t take true strength measurements; in other words, they don’t measure the absolute maximum amount of weight you’re capable of lifting. Going for your “max” can be dangerous and can cause more than a\\n\\n26 Part I: Getting Your Butt off the Couch\\n\\nlittle muscle soreness. Instead, gyms test your muscular endurance: how many times you can move a much lighter weight. You can do many of these tests at home. Having a friend count for you and make sure you’re doing the exercise correctly is a help. Here are some common muscular endurance measures.\\n\\nMeasuring your upper-body strength\\n\\nCount how many push-ups you can do without stopping or losing good form. For this test, men do military push-ups, with their legs out straight and toes on the floor. Women do modified push-ups, with their knees bent and feet off the floor. Lower your entire body at once until your upper arms are parallel to the floor. Pull your abdominals in to prevent your back from sagging. Do this test correctly! One guy we watched didn’t have the strength to lower his body all the way, so he just bobbed his head up and down.\\n\\nUse Table 2-3 or Table 2-4 to find out how you stack up against other people of your age and gender.\\n\\nTable 2-3\\n\\nPush-Ups — Men\\n\\nAge:\\n\\n20–29\\n\\n30–39\\n\\n40–49\\n\\n50–59\\n\\n60+\\n\\nExcellent\\n\\n55+\\n\\n45+\\n\\n40+\\n\\n35+\\n\\n30+\\n\\nGood\\n\\n45–54\\n\\n35–44\\n\\n30–39\\n\\n25–34\\n\\n20–29\\n\\nAverage\\n\\n35–44\\n\\n25–34\\n\\n20–29\\n\\n15–24\\n\\n10–19\\n\\nFair\\n\\n20–34\\n\\n15–24\\n\\n12–19\\n\\n8–14\\n\\n5–9\\n\\nLow\\n\\n0–19\\n\\n0–14\\n\\n0–11\\n\\n0–7\\n\\n0–4\\n\\nTable 2-4\\n\\nPush-Ups — Women\\n\\nAge:\\n\\n20–29\\n\\n30–39\\n\\n40–49\\n\\n50–59\\n\\n60+\\n\\nExcellent\\n\\n49+\\n\\n40+\\n\\n35+\\n\\n30+\\n\\n20+\\n\\nGood\\n\\n34–48\\n\\n25–39\\n\\n20–34\\n\\n15–29\\n\\n5–19\\n\\nAverage\\n\\n17–33\\n\\n12–24\\n\\n8–19\\n\\n6–14\\n\\n3–4\\n\\nFair\\n\\n6–16\\n\\n4–11\\n\\n3–7\\n\\n2–5\\n\\n1–2\\n\\nLow\\n\\n0–5\\n\\n0–3\\n\\n0–2\\n\\n0–1\\n\\n0\\n\\nChapter 2: Testing Your Fitness\\n\\n27\\n\\nSome health clubs also measure upper-body strength on a free-weight bench press or a chest-press machine. (In Chapter 12, we explain the difference between free weights and machines.) The amount of weight doesn’t matter, as long as you use the same weight every time you get tested. You simply do as many repetitions as you can.\\n\\nMeasuring your abdominal strength\\n\\nThe strength of your abdominal muscles is usually measured by a crunch test. (However, this test isn’t recommended if you have a history of lower- back problems.)\\n\\nPlace two pieces of masking tape about halfway down the length of a mat, one directly behind the other, about 21⁄2 inches apart. Lie on your back on the mat with your arms at your sides and your fingertips touching the rear edge of the back piece of tape. Bend your knees and place your feet flat on the floor. Curl your head, neck, and shoulder blades upward, sliding your palms along the floor until your fingertips touch the front edge of the front piece of tape. Return to the starting position and keep going until you’re too tired to continue or you can’t reach the tape. Don’t cheat by sliding your arms with- out moving your body or by moving only one side of your body. See Figure 2-2 for an example of the crunch test.\\n\\nFigure 2-2: The crunch test.\\n\\nPhotograph by Sunstreak Productions, Inc.\\n\\nUse Tables 2-5 and 2-6 to gauge the results of your crunch test.\\n\\n28 Part I: Getting Your Butt off the Couch\\n\\nTable 2-5\\n\\nCrunches — Men\\n\\nAge:\\n\\nUnder 35\\n\\n36–45\\n\\nOver 45\\n\\nExcellent\\n\\n60\\n\\n50\\n\\n40\\n\\nGood\\n\\n45\\n\\n40\\n\\n25\\n\\nMarginal\\n\\n30\\n\\n25\\n\\n15\\n\\nNeeds work\\n\\n15\\n\\n10\\n\\n5\\n\\nTable 2-6\\n\\nCrunches — Women\\n\\nAge:\\n\\nUnder 35\\n\\n36–45\\n\\nOver 45\\n\\nExcellent\\n\\n50\\n\\n40\\n\\n30\\n\\nGood\\n\\n40\\n\\n25\\n\\n15\\n\\nMarginal\\n\\n25\\n\\n15\\n\\n10\\n\\nNeeds work\\n\\n10\\n\\n6\\n\\n4\\n\\nMeasuring your lower-body strength\\n\\nThe strength of your lower-body muscles is often measured on a leg-extension machine, which targets your front-thigh muscles. (This machine is sort of like a big chair with a high back.) Some clubs test lower-body strength on other machines; others don’t test your lower-body strength at all.\\n\\nYou can test the strength of your thigh and butt muscles at home by doing an exercise called a squat, described in Chapter 14. We suggest that, if you’re a woman, you hold a 5-pound dumbbell in each hand with your arms hanging down at your sides, and if you’re a man, use 15-pound dumbbells. If you’re a novice, skip the weight and place your hands on your hips.\\n\\nThere are few standard norms for this test, so just use your results as a basis of comparison for future evaluations.\\n\\nHow Flexible Are You?\\n\\nHow come gymnasts can wrap their legs around their shoulders while you have trouble touching your toes? Because gymnasts are more flexible than you are. Flexibility refers to how far you can move around a joint’s axis (your\\n\\nChapter 2: Testing Your Fitness\\n\\n29\\n\\nrange of motion) and how easily you can move it. Because your muscles attach to your bone and bones move around a joint’s axis (therefore, muscles move the bones around a joint), flexibility also refers to the mobility of your muscles.\\n\\nFlexibility tests sometimes feel like a cross between circus tryouts and an IQ test. The tester asks you to twist yourself into some strange positions, and you have to figure out what he’s talking about. Then you have to see whether your body agrees to follow along.\\n\\nOne common test is the sit-and-reach, which measures the flexibility of your lower-back and rear-thigh muscles. You sit with your legs out straight and place your feet flat on the side of a special metal box. Keeping your legs straight, you lean forward and reach toward the box as far as you can. Along the top of the box, a scale in inches measures how far you reach forward. We find it amusing that the special box costs $200. You can do this same test with the carton that the box comes in.\\n\\nSome clubs don’t get that sophisticated with flexibility measurements; don’t hold it against them. As a measure of lower-back and hamstring flexibility, they may simply ask you to bend over and try to touch your toes. Estimating your flexibility instead of measuring it to the exact degree is okay. At least you find out which joints are tight, so you emphasize them when you stretch. For details about how to stretch properly, see Chapter 6.\\n\\nTable 2-7 describes flexibility tests you can do at home. You may also encounter these tests during a health-club evaluation.\\n\\nTable 2-7\\n\\nTesting Your Flexibility\\n\\nThe Test\\n\\nWhat to Do\\n\\nYou Have Good Your Flexibility Flexibility If . . .

A conscien- tious tester will also help you use the results of tests to customize cardiovascular, strength- training, and flexibility workouts.\\n\\nYour test results should be detailed on a piece of paper (sort of like a report card) that you can take home. Save this piece of paper so you can see how much you’ve improved later. One day, it may mean more to you than your high school diploma.\\n\\nChapter 3 Establishing Your Plan of Attack\\n\\nIn This Chapter (cid:1) Establishing fitness goals (cid:1) Rewarding yourself in small ways (cid:1) Tracking your fitness progress (cid:1) Making fitness a daily habit\\n\\nof where you want to take your company and how you propose to get there. Instead, you would assess your cash flow and expenses, choose a loca- tion for your office, decide on your hours of operation, and develop strategies to overcome obstacles.\\n\\nYou wouldn’t start or expand a business without a plan — a clear-cut idea\\n\\nYour workout program deserves the same level of attention, whether you’re just beginning to map out your fitness plan or looking to expand and improve your current fitness routine. This chapter helps you develop your plan of attack. We show you how to set realistic goals and track your progress, and we offer strategies for sticking to your plan so that your workout program is as successful as any of those upstart Internet companies run by 20-year-old CEOs.\\n\\nSetting Goals\\n\\nBefore you embark on a new exercise program — or attempt to invigorate your existing one — clarify why you want to get fit. Maybe heart disease runs in your family, and you want to avoid carrying on that tradition. Maybe you can’t keep up with your grandkids. Maybe your pants split as you got up to greet your blind date, and you thought, “I really ought to do something about this.” Whatever the reason, make sure you’re doing this for yourself — not simply to please your doctor or to lure back the spouse who left you for some- one much younger.\\n\\n34 Part I: Getting Your Butt off the Couch\\n\\nThen, after you evaluate your current fitness level (see Chapter 2 for details about fitness testing), start setting specific goals. Research shows that goal- setting works. In typical studies, scientists give one group of exercisers a spe- cific goal, such as doing 60 sit-ups. Meanwhile, they tell a second group of exercisers simply, “Do your best.” The exercisers with specific goals tend to have significantly more success than the comparison groups. This approach can work for you, too.\\n\\nWhen you start an exercise program, you need to set a few different types of goals. Look at the big picture while giving yourself stepping stones to get there. Having mini-goals makes your long-term goals seem more feasible. Here’s a look at the different types of goals you should set.\\n\\nLong-term goals\\n\\nGive yourself a goal for the next three to six months. Some people get really creative with their long-term goals. One Ohio woman Suzanne interviewed set a long-term goal to walk to a friend’s house — in Birmingham, Alabama. No, she didn’t literally hoof it 697 miles. She charted the route on an auto-club map, and for every 20 minutes that she spent doing an aerobic exercise video, she gave herself credit for 1 mile. At the end of each week, she added up her “mileage” and used a yellow highlighter to mark the ground she covered on the map.\\n\\nMake sure your long-term goals are realistic. If you start your swimming pro- gram today, jumping into the frigid waters of the English Channel and swim- ming all the way to France is not exactly what we recommend for a six-month goal. On the other hand, don’t be afraid to dream. Choose a goal that really sparks you — something that may be out of reach at the moment but is not out of the realm of possibility. People are often surprised by what they can accomplish. Liz has a client who was 60 years old when he started training for a trek up Alaska’s Mount McKinley. Liz eventually had the guy walking uphill for up to 90 minutes on the treadmill with a heavy pack and hiking boots. After six months of training, the man successfully completed his trek. He was the oldest one on the trip, but he wasn’t the slowest. His success inspired him to train for many other hiking events.\\n\\nJudge for yourself what’s realistic. Some people rise to the occasion when they set goals that seem virtually impossible. Other people get discouraged by setting extremely high expectations. If you’re a beginner, we recommend setting moderately challenging goals. If you reach your goals earlier than you expect, that’s the time to choose more ambitious ones. Here are some concrete examples of long-term goals that may spark your imagination:\\n\\n(cid:2) Complete a 50-mile bike ride that’s four months away. (cid:2) Drop 3 percent body fat in 10 weeks.\\n\\nChapter 3: Establishing Your Plan of Attack\\n\\n35\\n\\n(cid:2) Do one full pull-up. (cid:2) Drop 20 points from cholesterol count. (cid:2) Fit into that pair of jeans. (cid:2) Walk 1 mile in under 15 minutes.\\n\\nShort-term goals\\n\\nSix months is a long time to wait for feelings of success. In order to stay motivated, you need to feel a sense of accomplishment along the way. When Suzanne was bicycling from the West Coast of the United States to the East Coast, she didn’t dream about the Atlantic Ocean every day; she focused on a goal that seemed more manageable, like getting across North Dakota. Set short-term goals for one week to one month. Here are some examples:\\n\\n(cid:2) Take two step aerobics classes a week for one month. (cid:2) Improve your 1-mile walk time by 20 seconds. (cid:2) Use the stair-climber four times this week for 30 minutes each time. (cid:2) Bicycle 60 miles a week for the next four weeks.\\n\\nImmediate goals\\n\\nImmediate goals refer to goals for each week, day, or workout. This way, when you walk into the gym, you don’t waste any time figuring out which exercises to do. Here are examples of immediate goals:\\n\\n(cid:2) Spend a full ten minutes stretching at the end of a workout. (cid:2) Do upper-body weight exercises and 20 minutes on the stair-climber. (cid:2) Run 2 miles. (cid:2) Bike a hilly 20-mile course.\\n\\nBackup goals\\n\\nYou always need a Plan B, in case something happens and you’re not able to reach your primary goal as soon as you want to. By setting backup goals, you have a better chance of achieving something, and you don’t feel like a failure if your long-term goal doesn’t work out. Suppose your long-term goal is to lose 10 pounds by eating healthier and walking 3 miles a day. Your backup\\n\\n36 Part I: Getting Your Butt off the Couch\\n\\ngoal could be increasing your stamina enough to walk 3 miles in less than an hour. Or say that you’re training for a 10K run in the spring, but you sprain an ankle and have to stop running. If one of your backup goals is to strengthen your upper body, you can still keep on track while your ankle heals.\\n\\nFinding Ways to Reward Yourself\\n\\nYou let your kids watch their favorite video when they bring home good grades, right? You give your golden retriever a doggy treat when he fetches the Frisbee. Be nice to yourself, too. Attach an appropriate reward to each of your goals. If you drop 3 percent body fat over the next two months, buy yourself a nifty sports watch. If you lift weights three days a week for a month, treat yourself to a massage. Sure, it’s bribery, but it works. Short-term rewards are particularly important because there’s always a chance that you may not make it all the way to your long-term goal. You need to give yourself credit for making it even halfway. (By the way, triple-decker fudge cake isn’t what we have in mind for a reward. Try to make sure your reward is as healthy as your goal.)\\n\\nAs with your goals, you can get pretty creative with your rewards. We know a guy who asked a friend to hold $500 for him. If he reached his goal of losing 25 pounds, he’d get the money back and buy new clothes. If he didn’t reach his goal, the money would become a charitable contribution to the Young Republicans. Considering that this guy made Edward Kennedy look like Rush Limbaugh, this was a very good incentive, indeed. The guy lost his 25 pounds.\\n\\nWriting Everything Down\\n\\nSetting goals and rewards is pretty easy; forgetting what they are is even easier. To keep yourself honest — and motivated — consider tracking your goals and accomplishments on paper. One friend of ours tapes his goals to the inside of his gym locker. Some people program their computers to flash their goals on-screen twice a day. A member of Liz’s Thursday night Internet chat group posts her fitness and weight-loss accomplishments on the mes- sage board every week, along with a note thanking other members for their encouraging notes. (And this idea of sharing your goals with others, even someone in the cubicle next door, is a powerful motivator and may keep you from giving up.) Losing 30 pounds was a big milestone for the woman and touched off quite a bit of buzz among the regulars. Other members of the group read these messages avidly and live vicariously through her progress; many have been inspired to start their own fitness programs. Here are some other ways that you can monitor your progress.\\n\\nChapter 3: Establishing Your Plan of Attack\\n\\n37\\n\\nMaking a goal sheet\\n\\nWrite down your goals on a piece of paper or index card and put it some- where so that you can see it every day, like taped to your desk or on your refrigerator. Next to every goal, write down the corresponding reward. This strategy isn’t just for amateurs. Many world-class athletes use it, too. Figure 3-1 shows a sample goal sheet that you can fill out each week. Underneath each heading, write down your goal and your target date.\\n\\nLong-Term Goals\\n\\nLong-Term Rewards\\n\\nBackup Long-Term Goals\\n\\nShort-Term Goals\\n\\nShort-Term Rewards\\n\\nWeekly Goals\\n\\nWeekly Rewards\\n\\nFigure 3-1: Make a goal sheet like the one here (or photocopy this one).\\n\\nWorkout Goals\\n\\nDaily Rewards\\n\\n38 Part I: Getting Your Butt off the Couch\\n\\nKeeping a workout log\\n\\nWhatever your goals are, keeping track of your workouts in a workout log (also called a workout diary or training diary) can help you get better results. You can look back at the end of each week and say, “I did that?” And you may be inspired to accomplish even more. Keeping a log shows you whether your goals are realistic and gives you insight into your exercise patterns. If you’re losing weight, building strength, or developing stamina, you won’t have to wonder what works, because you’ll have a blow-by-blow description of every- thing you’ve done to reach your goals.\\n\\nOn the other hand, if you get injured or stuck in a rut, you can turn to your diary for clues as to why. You may discover that if you don’t eat before you cycle, you cover your usual route five minutes slower. Maybe you pull a ham- string every time you run over a certain hilly course. Maybe you’re more sus- ceptible to catching a cold if you don’t rest at least one day each week.\\n\\nA workout diary keeps you honest. You may think that you’re working out four times a week. But when you flip through your log, you may realize that you’ve been overestimating your efforts.\\n\\nBookstores and sporting-goods stores carry a variety of logs, some aimed at walkers, others at weight lifters; others have space to chart any activity you can think of. You also can buy nifty computer software to monitor your progress or use a Web-based tracking program. In Chapter 25, we mention some of our favorite products for recording your workouts. You can also use Figure 3-2 (photocopying the page) to see whether you enjoy tracking your workouts on paper.\\n\\nHere are some suggestions for filling in the blanks.\\n\\nDay, date, and conditions Don’t forget to note the day and date. This information helps you assess what you’ve done in a week; when you look back, you’ll know whether you ran those 20 miles in one week or two. Also, you may discover that you always have a bad workout on Fridays because you stay up late Thursday nights to watch ER. Maybe Friday is the day for you to take off. Note the day and date of your rest days, as well. This way you know how much recovery time you’re giving yourself.\\n\\nIn the Conditions box, you may also want to note the weather conditions, including the wind and the temperature, because you work much harder when it’s raining or hot. Describe the course you cover (was it hilly or flat?); who you worked out with (“Marge talks too much”), and how you feel before, during, and after your workout. These notes may help you trace the root of any training problems that crop up.\\n\\nChapter 3: Establishing Your Plan of Attack\\n\\n39\\n\\nDay of the Week\\n\\nDate\\n\\nConditions\\n\\nGoals\\n\\nCardiovascular Training\\n\\nTime\\n\\nDistance\\n\\nDifficulty Rating\\n\\nStrength Training\\n\\nWeight\\n\\nSets\\n\\nReps\\n\\nNotes\\n\\nNotes\\n\\nFigure 3-2: A sample workout log.\\n\\nGoals for the workout Write down what you hope to accomplish during your workout, like complet- ing the 20-minute Roller Coaster program on the stair-climber or swimming a half mile. Rather than scribbling a few lines while you’re running from the locker room into an aerobics class, fill in this section the night before or, better yet, immediately following your last workout. This makes you stop and think about just what it is that you’re trying to achieve. If you keep your goals in mind, you may have more enthusiasm for your workout.\\n\\nCardiovascular training Write down the type of activity, whether it’s stationary cycling, walking, skat- ing, rowing, and so on. In the Time and Distance sections, note how long your aerobic session lasted and (when applicable) how far you went — for example:\\n\\n40 Part I: Getting Your Butt off the Couch\\n\\n(cid:2) Cardiovascular Training: “Jogged on treadmill” (cid:2) Time: “20 minutes” (cid:2) Distance: “1.8 miles”\\n\\nIn the Difficulty Rating box, rate your workout on a scale from one to ten. Don’t base this assessment simply on the number of miles you walked or the number of calories you burned. Instead, rate your workouts according to how hard you push yourself. A 1 rating is an extremely easy day; a 10 is an all-out workout. (See Chapter 8 for details on rating your exertion.) The purpose of the difficulty rating is to remind you to aim for a healthy mix of numbers. If you rate a 9 on Monday, Tuesday is a good day for a 2 workout. Log a 0 for the days you don’t exercise.\\n\\nStrength training Jot down the name of each exercise, the amount of weight you lifted, and the number of sets you did. (If you need any of these terms defined, see Chapter 14.) If you don’t know the name of an exercise, make it a point to find out. Writing down “bicep curl” may reinforce the idea that this exercise strengthens your biceps. (If you’re not sure where your biceps are, see Chapter 12.) You may also want to note what changes you need to make during your next weight-lifting session. Suppose you use 50 pounds on the leg-press machine and have a pretty easy time of it. In your diary, write that you want to try 60 pounds the next time. Also, note which exercises are par- ticularly easy and which need more attention.\\n\\nStretching Simply note whether you stretched or not. You may also jot down a few words about which muscles felt the tightest and which stretches felt the best.\\n\\nNotes Here’s your chance to record any details that don’t seem to fit into the other categories. For example, you may describe a new leg exercise you tried. Or you may elaborate on which yoga poses you found most difficult. Or you may realize that you always feel great when you work out with a certain friend. Write down whatever you feel is important.\\n\\nMaking Exercise a Habit\\n\\nAs we mention in the introduction to this book, 50 percent of new exercisers quit within eight weeks. Of course, we want to make sure that you’re among the other 50 percent. The following tips can help you get over the hump and\\n\\nChapter 3: Establishing Your Plan of Attack\\n\\n41\\n\\nboost the odds that you’ll stick with your new program. We discuss several of these topics in detail throughout the book, but we want you to keep them in mind from the start.\\n\\nExpect to feel uncomfortable at first\\n\\nExercise doesn’t need to be painful, but if you’ve neglected your body, don’t expect a free ride. Despite what you hear on infomercials — “just five minutes a day, and you can do this on the couch while watching TV!” — exercise is a serious commitment. You can’t get into shape without exerting some real effort and, perhaps, without experiencing some (but not a lot of) discomfort.\\n\\nPace yourself\\n\\nDon’t buy every exercise video on the market or try every weight machine in the gym the first day. You’ll kill your enthusiasm and flame out fast. Always keep yourself hungry for more.\\n\\nWork out with friends or join a club\\n\\nAn exercise buddy can push you to new heights — or get your butt outside for a walk on the days when you’d rather stay home and watch reruns of Bewitched. If you make a date to meet a friend at the gym, you’re a lot more likely to show up than if you make a date with yourself.\\n\\nTake the initiative to find workout buddies by joining an exercise class at your community center or YMCA, a Sierra Club hike, a local running group, or a charity event or race that has a training program.\\n\\nMix it up\\n\\nOne common complaint about exercise is that it’s boring. But if you change your workouts every couple of months, or even every time you exercise, that excuse pretty much flies out the window. This book is filled with ideas for varying your workouts — experimenting with different weight-training equip- ment, trying new stretches, and changing the intensity of your cardiovascular program, doing full-body or body-part workouts, training energy systems, varying reps, sets, times, intensity techniques, and so on.\\n\\n42 Part I: Getting Your Butt off the Couch\\n\\nNot only does this strategy keep you motivated, but it also keeps you healthy. Many injuries are the result of repeating the same movement patterns. So if you alternate, say, swimming with running, you’re less likely to develop the knee problems that are common to runners or the shoulder injuries that crop up among swimmers.\\n\\nBuy the right gear and equipment\\n\\nCycling isn’t going to be fun if you’re riding an old clunker that doesn’t shift properly. Walking isn’t going to be comfortable or safe if you’re doing it in sandals. You don’t need to spend megabucks on top-of-the-line equipment, but investing in the right gear and equipment can sometimes be the differ- ence between success and failure.\\n\\nLiz had a client who went out hiking in a 20-year-old pair of aerobics shoes and had a miserable time. She kept twisting her ankles because the shoes had poor ankle support, and her feet were blistered and bruised because the thin padding didn’t protect her from the rocks underfoot. Upon returning from her hike, the client announced to Liz that she hated hiking. Liz suggested that she buy a new pair of hiking boots and give it another try. The next time out, out- fitted in a comfy, sturdy pair of boots, the woman sailed to the head of the group and leapt from rock to rock like a mountain goat. She then reported to Liz that she loved hiking.\\n\\nIn Chapter 10, we discuss gadgets and apparel you need for a number of dif- ferent outdoor activities. But here are some general tips on shoes, one of the most important fitness purchases:\\n\\n(cid:2) Buy the right shoe for your sport. Walking shoes are more flexible and have firmer heel support than running shoes. Shoes for tennis, golf, and basketball have their own special designs; even sprinters and dis- tance runners have different footwear needs. If you dabble in a variety of activities — walking one day, biking the next, and lifting weights the next — cross-training shoes may suffice (ask for them at your favorite sporting-goods store), but if you spend a lot of time doing one particular activity, invest in shoes designed for that activity.\\n\\n(cid:2) Don’t cheap out. Bargain brands may look the same, but today’s fitness shoes are highly technical. Beneath those swooshes, stripes, and flashy colors, a lot of biomechanical engineering is going on to protect your feet, ankles, and other joints. A decent pair of athletic shoes may cost you at least $40, and in some cases more than double that. But you save money down the line: One thing that’s always more expensive than a good pair of shoes is a visit to an orthopedist.\\n\\nChapter 3: Establishing Your Plan of Attack\\n\\n43\\n\\n(cid:2) Shop at a specialty store where the salespeople are fitness enthusiasts themselves. In New York, runners are blessed with a fine chain of equip- ment shops called Super Runners, and many other cities and suburban areas have at least one running and/or walking store. If you’re a tennis player, look for a tennis specialty store. Same with cycling, yoga, and so on. When you find a shoe you’re comfortable with, you can save money on future pairs by shopping through a catalog or by joining a frequent-buyers club at your local shop.\\n\\n(cid:2) Make sure the shoes feel good from the moment you put them on. Forget this “breaking in” business. Try on several pairs of shoes, and take each one for a test run around the mall. Bounce up and down in them; mime a few quick volleys.\\n\\nCut yourself some slack\\n\\nRecognize that people come in all shapes and sizes, and everyone improves at a different pace. Getting inspiration from other people is great, but don’t let anyone else’s accomplishments diminish your own. Be proud that you’ve worked up to walking 3 miles every other day, even if your neighbor runs 10 miles a day.\\n\\nAnd don’t get mad at yourself if you miss a few days — or even a few months — of exercise. Expect to be up and down a bit in your motivation, which means you won’t always exercise with the same consistency and frequency. If you fall off the wagon, just try again. You have the rest of your life to get this right.\\n\\n44 Part I: Getting Your Butt off the Couch\\n\\nChapter 4 Hiring a Trainer\\n\\nIn This Chapter (cid:1) Identifying good reasons to hire a trainer (cid:1) Screening potential trainers (cid:1) Knowing how much a trainer should cost (cid:1) Recognizing the signs of a quality trainer (cid:1) Being a good client\\n\\nOperating exercise equipment isn’t nuclear physics, but neither is it\\n\\nsomething you should attempt to figure out on your own. We recom- mend signing up with a trainer — for at least one session — to get yourself started on a strength and cardiovascular program suited to your goals. Even workout veterans have plenty to gain from a session or two with a trainer.\\n\\nA trainer can teach you the subtleties of using exercise equipment: how to grip a barbell, how far to pull down a rope, and how to adjust a machine to fit your body — stuff that’s tough to glean from a book or video. We know a woman who hired a trainer just to teach her how to use the new technology in her gym, like the computerized weight machines, the wireless TV/radio headphones, and the fancy treadmill programs.\\n\\nA good trainer can teach you all this and more. Unfortunately, the industry has its share of quacks. This chapter explains how you can benefit from a trainer and discusses how to find a qualified one.\\n\\nFive Smart Reasons to Hire a Trainer\\n\\nTrainers do a lot more than just whip wimpy actors into shape for their next action movie, and they don’t all charge $200 an hour. (We tell you more about how much you should expect to pay in the “Trainer fees” section later in this chapter.) Consider hiring a trainer if you’re in any of the following situations:\\n\\n46 Part I: Getting Your Butt off the Couch\\n\\n(cid:2) You’re totally out of shape (or deconditioned, as the politically cor-\\n\\nrect like to say). If climbing the ropes in high school gym class was the last time you worked out, a personal trainer is a great way to bring you into the modern age. A lot has changed over the years, from the equip- ment to the lingo to proper stretching and strength-training techniques. A trainer can get you comfortable in your new environment and start you on a program that’s appropriate for your fitness level, so your new foray into fitness doesn’t end a week later with a trip to the orthopedist. You don’t need to sign up for life; five to ten sessions can get you up and running.\\n\\n(cid:2) You want to update your program. You can hire a trainer for a session or two to reevaluate your workout regimen. If you’re feeling stagnant, a new routine can give you a jump-start and ultimately improve your fit- ness level. (Of course, you actually have to work out for this to happen.)\\n\\n(cid:2) You’re training for a specific goal. Say you want to run your first 10K race, but you aren’t sure how long, how far, how often, or how hard to train. A qualified trainer can design a workout program that’ll get you to the finish line. Look for a trainer who specializes in the area you want to work on, such as losing weight, building strength, or getting fit for ski season. We know a trainer who works only with runners, designing their running schedules and appropriate strength-training and stretching rou- tines. Many of her clients are people who want to run their first marathon without getting injured.\\n\\n(cid:2) You’re coming back from an injury or illness. If you have a specific\\n\\ncondition such as lower back pain, or if you’ve just had surgery on your knee, a trainer can help you get back on your feet. Check with your doctor; she may want you to visit a physical therapist first. Still, more and more physicians are giving the okay for trainers to participate in a patient’s rehabilitation. Screen the trainer carefully, so you don’t make matters worse. A growing number of trainers specialize in conditions such as multiple sclerosis or breast cancer.\\n\\n(cid:2) You need motivation. If you won’t exercise unless a trainer is standing\\n\\nthere counting your repetitions, consider the money well spent.\\n\\nWeeding Out the Poseurs\\n\\nCurrently, few states have legal requirements for fitness trainers (and even those laws have loopholes). At the same time, a behind-the-scenes scramble is underway among the various professional organizations vying to be declared the official certifying body. In the meantime, however, anyone who can hoist a dumbbell and print a business card on a home computer can call himself a personal trainer.\\n\\nChapter 4: Hiring a Trainer\\n\\n47\\n\\nScreen a potential trainer with the same care that you use to screen a poten- tial employee. And don’t be afraid to try someone new if you don’t hit it off with the first trainer. It’s your time, your money, and your health we’re talking about. Our friend Daniel was thoroughly demoralized by his first trainer. “The guy kept looking at himself in the mirror and then pulling up his shirt and showing me his abs,” Daniel recalls. “Then he’d stick me on some machine without showing me any technique and leave me there while he’d go talk to some girl.” It took Daniel four years to muster the courage to hire another trainer. “I should never have waited so long,” says Daniel, who’s now a confi- dent lifter and a regular in the weight room.\\n\\nThe following sections tell you what to consider when investigating trainers.\\n\\nCertification\\n\\nAs with many other occupations and professions, the fitness industry offers certification tests. A certification is by no means a guarantee of competence, but getting certified by quality organizations is a time-consuming, pain-in- the-butt process. You have to study for at least a few months and then spend a full day taking a test. At the very least, going through this process shows commitment: You know that the trainer isn’t just doing this job because it pays better than her old job as a bike messenger. And by getting the certification, trainers surely pick up enough to have a basic level of competence.\\n\\nStill, some mighty unqualified people show up for these exams. While proc- toring a recent certification test, Liz asked one candidate to demonstrate a thigh stretch. He sat down on the floor and twisted one of his legs behind him, then began scooting himself forward on the floor. When Liz asked why he was doing that, the candidate explained that the maneuver shocks the muscle into stretching. He admitted that the stretch was indeed as painful as it looked, but said that was an unfortunate but necessary part of the exercise. Although Liz was technically not allowed to offer candidates her opinion, she felt compelled to tell the guy that he should never, ever, ever use that tech- nique with a client.\\n\\nHigh-quality certifying organizations weed out bozos like that. However, some organizations certify any breathing body. These schools are sometimes adver- tised on late-night TV or in the back of fitness magazines (alongside the ads for legitimate schools). You definitely don’t want a trainer who graduated from the National Correspondence School of Diesel Mechanics, TV Repair, and Personal Training. If you’re skeptical, ask to see a copy of the actual certificate.\\n\\n48 Part I: Getting Your Butt off the Couch\\n\\nThe following are among the best organizations that certify trainers. Their Web sites can refer you to certified trainers in your area. And make sure that your trainer’s certification is current; most expire after a year or two unless the trainer takes continuing education classes.\\n\\n(cid:2) Aerobics and Fitness Association of America (AFAA): This organization offers a variety of certifications, including Personal Trainer and Advanced Personal Trainer. The Personal Trainer exam, which includes both a practical and written portion (and many other tests are written-only), covers a wide range of topics but require less knowledge than ACSM or ACE certification tests. If the AFAA Personal Trainer is your trainer’s only certification, your trainer may be a former aerobics instructor making the switch to personal trainer without enough education or experience. Or, the trainer may have taken the exam out of convenience, because it’s offered in many rural areas where other exams aren’t available. See the organization’s Web site at www.afaa.com.\\n\\n(cid:2) American College of Sports Medicine (ACSM): The ACSM offers several certification levels and usually requires that the trainer possess a gradu- ate degree in one of the exercise sciences. The certification we recom- mend is the Health/Fitness Instructor. The test is very tough, so many trainers avoid it, but it’s the gold standard for personal trainers. Visit www.acsm.org.\\n\\n(cid:2) American Council on Exercise (ACE): This organization certifies both personal trainers and group trainers (such as aerobics instructors); we prefer the certification geared toward personal trainers. The ACE Personal Trainer certification is the most popular in the industry, and although the test is easier than the ACSM Health/Fitness Instructor test, it’s still plenty challenging. The certification is more practical than most, empha- sizing the trainer’s ability to design appropriate programs for a wide vari- ety of fitness levels and medical conditions. Visit www.acefitness.org.\\n\\n(cid:2) International Sport Science Association (ISSA): ISSA has ten different\\n\\ncertification programs, including Youth Fitness, Personal Fitness Trainer, and Senior Fitness. Most of its programs are similar in the information they contain, with sections devoted to the specific area of certification. ISSA has more of a bodybuilding emphasis and focus from its founders, educators, and information. Its certification process is actually more stringent than many, requiring case studies and written papers as part of the process, in addition to the written test. Although not quite at the level of the other certifying organizations, ISSA has become much more widely recognized. Check out www.issaonline.com.\\n\\n(cid:2) National Academy of Sports Medicine (NASM): This group, now affili-\\n\\nated with Reebok, offers a well-respected and practical Personal Trainer certification. Trainers must attend a workshop and pass an exam; train- ers need strong physiology, anatomy, and biomechanics backgrounds\\n\\nChapter 4: Hiring a Trainer\\n\\n49\\n\\ngoing into the workshop, which provides the education, solutions, and tools needed by fitness professionals to systematically progress any client through specific phases of training in order to reach any goal. NASM trainers have a strong emphasis on understanding the in-depth workings of the body as a functional unit. Check out www.nasm.org. (cid:2) National Strength and Conditioning Association (NSCA): This organiza- tion offers two tough certifications: the Certified Strength and Condi- tioning Specialist (CSCS), geared toward training high-level athletes in team sports, and the Certified Personal Trainer (CPT), designed for train- ers who work in gyms. All trainers must pass a three-part written exam that includes a video analysis of exercises. Trainers certified by the NSCA usually know a lot about strength training and conditioning; the NSCA asks candidates to identify every muscle involved in a particular exercise and requires them to know precisely what role each muscle is playing at which point in the movement. Visit the NSCA Certification Commission at www.nsca-cc.org.\\n\\n(cid:2) Specialty certifications: Some specialty fields, such as yoga (see Chapter 16), Pilates (see Chapter 17), and kickboxing (discussed in Chapter 19) do have certifications. Others, such as boxing, don’t. Don’t expect a boxing instructor or a country-and-western line-dancing teacher to be certified as a trainer. But if he does have a diploma from one of the organizations we list, that’s a plus.\\n\\nThese organizations aren’t the only ones that offer certifications and certifi- cates. Many colleges and universities offer their own extensive programs. And while some health clubs put their employees through rigorous training courses, trust courses from recognized organizations and universities above all else.\\n\\nUniversity degrees\\n\\nMost trainers don’t have degrees in physiology or related fields, so don’t hold it against them. But a master’s degree (M.A. or M.S.) is usually even better than a certification, and a fitness-related B.A. or B.S. can be a big plus. Look for degrees in exercise physiology, exercise science, physical therapy, occupa- tional therapy, fitness management, sports medicine, physical education, or kinesiology. If the trainer has a fitness-related university degree but not an industry certification, ask whether she keeps up with the latest techniques by going to conferences and seminars. Opinions and facts change quickly in the health and fitness field; if your trainer earned his Ph.D. in 1973 and hasn’t attended a workshop since, he needs to join the modern world.\\n\\n50 Part I: Getting Your Butt off the Couch\\n\\nMany registered nurses and physical therapists are getting into the training business. They tend to know a lot about how muscles work; what’s more, they may be able to accept insurance reimbursement if a doctor recommends training for treatment or rehab purposes.\\n\\nExperience\\n\\nChoose a trainer who has at least two years of experience at a club or on her own. Be sure to check references. The best way to get the lowdown on a trainer is from other clients. Also consider your own needs: If you’re looking to have a detailed program designed, you have medical conditions or injuries that require experience, or you have specific athletic goals you want to reach, look for someone with many years of experience.\\n\\nBrochures\\n\\nAn in-home trainer should have a brochure or packet describing her back- ground and experience as well as her focus and philosophy. (Trainers employed by a single health club probably won’t have brochures, although clubs may post information about their trainers’ qualifications.) The packet also should clearly explain fees, payment schedules, and cancellation policies. Printed materials show a degree of professionalism. Many trainers also have their own Web sites. Clients can go on the Net and peruse the trainer’s bio, photo, and sample workouts.\\n\\nLiability insurance\\n\\nMake sure your trainer has insurance to cover any mishaps that may occur. Many trainers have you sign a release, but this doesn’t absolve them from responsibility and from using safe and appropriate judgment, like asking you to bench-press 250 pounds during your first workout.\\n\\nLawsuits against trainers are unusual but not unprecedented. The widower of a health-club member who died of a stroke filed a $40 million suit against his wife’s trainer for giving dangerous nutritional advice. (The club was also named in the suit.) According to the suit, the trainer recommended ephedra, an herbal supplement that has been linked to dozens of deaths and should never be taken by people with high blood pressure. At the time, the woman was taking prescription medicine for hypertension.\\n\\nChapter 4: Hiring a Trainer\\n\\n51\\n\\nAn interview\\n\\nTo make sure that you’re compatible with your trainer, talk with him at length and ask questions before hiring him. A trainer may look good on paper but may not be able to speak in complete sentences. Or you may have a personal- ity conflict — the trainer may have too much or too little enthusiasm for your taste. Liz knows a woman who won’t work with a particular trainer because the trainer laughs too loudly; she’s afraid he’ll draw too much attention to her when she already feels self-conscious about working out.\\n\\nDon’t judge your potential trainer by looks alone. Just because someone’s a chiseled workout god doesn’t mean he knows which exercises are best for you or even how to teach them to you. A great teacher can live in a less-than- godlike body.\\n\\nA trial session\\n\\nBefore you commit to several sessions with a trainer, ask for a free or dis- counted trial workout. Also look for a money-back guarantee if you’re not fully satisfied with your trainer or the session. Many trainers will comply in the hopes of getting a long-term client. Most gyms that offer personal training either offer a first session free or a discounted session before making you commit to a package of sessions.\\n\\nTrainer fees\\n\\nFees vary from region to region, and from big cities to small towns. In Des Moines, you may pay $30 an hour; in New York, the going rate is between $85 and $105 per hour, and trainers charging as much as $120 per hour is not uncommon. (Charges depend on experience and popularity; the more experi- enced and popular a client, the higher the fee.) Ask friends or call gyms to get a sense of rates in your area, so you know if a trainer’s fees are way out of the ballpark.\\n\\nOn the off chance that someone is charging too little, watch out. Your so-called trainer may just be a pizza-delivery guy who happens to work out in his spare time and thinks he can make extra cash on the side.\\n\\nIf you belong to a health club, you’ll probably save money by hiring a trainer through the club. Good gyms thoroughly screen their trainers and keep an eye on them. However, follow the rules we list in the preceding section for weeding out bad trainers: Don’t assume that the club hires trainers who are certified and experienced.\\n\\n52 Part I: Getting Your Butt off the Couch\\n\\nYou also can cut costs by signing up for joint sessions with a friend. The trainer may charge slightly more than the regular hourly fee, but split two ways, your session is still a deal. You won’t get quite as much attention from the trainer, but teaming up with a friend may make a session affordable. Try to choose a friend who’s at the same fitness level as you or who has similar fitness goals. If you’re training for a marathon and your friend is a linebacker getting ready for football season, the trainer is going to have a tough time serving both your needs at once.\\n\\nAnother way to save money is to do a half-hour of cardio exercise on your own (see Part III of this book) with a program designed but not supervised by your trainer, and then hook up with the trainer for a half-hour of weight train- ing. This is a service primarily offered by gym trainers, as opposed to trainers who come to your home.\\n\\nCybertrainers\\n\\nIf you’re not big on human contact, if you want to save money, or if you just can’t get enough of technology, you may be interested in hiring an Internet trainer. We can’t really call these “per- sonal” trainers, because you never actually come face-to-face with a person, but many of these Web sites offer more individualized advice than you can get from a book or a video (or a lousy human trainer). But watch out: Some of these sites are a rip-off.\\n\\nMost programs start by asking you questions about your health, your goals, and your current workouts. The better ones also ask you to per- form some basic at-home fitness tests, similar to those we describe in Chapter 2, and then enter the results online. The really bad ones ask you for little more than your credit-card number.\\n\\nAfter you plug in all this info, your cybertrainer sends you a workout routine with suggested exercises, sets, and repetitions. Usually, you can download videos demonstrating how to perform each recommended exercise. Or, you can go to an exercise database, click on any number of exercises for a particular muscle group, and watch a demonstration. You can print out the routine and take it with you to the\\n\\ngym, or tack it up on the wall at home. If you plug in your workouts, you get feedback — allegedly from an actual human being — on how you’re progressing. For example, the trainer may suggest that you increase your weight or try a new shoulder exercise.\\n\\nThe Internet training program Web sites we like best, http://personaltraining.org and www.physicalgenius.com, offer work- outs designed by trainers who seem to know what they’re doing. Physical Genius lets you download programs into a handheld device that you can carry to the gym. You have to pay a couple hundred dollars for the device, which you order through the site.\\n\\nExpect to pay up to $500 for four months of cybertraining. Watch out for programs that charge $100 a session and those with exercise descriptions written in jargonese. Pay attention to the credentials of the trainers who are sup- posed to have designed the routines.\\n\\nTo find an Internet trainer other than the two we list, enter “online personal trainer,” “workout programs,” or “weight-training programs” into Google or some other search engine.\\n\\nChapter 4: Hiring a Trainer\\n\\n53\\n\\nFinally, ask whether your trainer charges by the hour or by the session. Typically, sessions last 45 to 90 minutes, including discussion and consultation time (not just workout time). If you’re paying by the hour and your session runs over, you may wind up paying a lot more than you expected.\\n\\nKnowing a Quality Trainer When You See One\\n\\nTrainers have different philosophies and use a variety of techniques. Some come from the drill-sergeant school of motivation; others prefer the cheer- leading approach. Still, there are some characteristics that all trainers should share. Choose a trainer who:\\n\\n(cid:2) Evaluates your fitness and goals: Before anything else, your trainer\\n\\nshould assess your current physical condition. (See Chapter 2 to find out what’s included in a fitness evaluation.) Then your trainer should have a long talk with you about your expectations for the training sessions — your hopes, your dreams, and your specific goals. All this information is crucial: To really be of help to you, a trainer must know where you’re starting from and where you want to go.\\n\\n(cid:2) Gives you a balanced program: Unless you specifically request other- wise, your sessions should include three components: cardiovascular exercise, strength training, and flexibility exercises. Some trainers prefer that you do the cardiovascular portion on your own, but if you ask, your trainer should help you design a program and keep tabs on your work- out and intensity. Heads up: Many trainers also skip the stretching and cool-down portions of a workout.\\n\\n(cid:2) Watches you closely: Your trainer should pay attention to your form and give you pointers throughout the session. On the other hand, you don’t want a trainer who blabs incessantly. Your trainer also should spot you — in other words, stand poised to grab the weight and give you some help if your muscles give out.\\n\\n(cid:2) Reassesses your goals and measures your progress: A good trainer\\n\\nretests you after the first six weeks of training and, if you’ve been work- ing out consistently, every two to three months thereafter. A trainer who is really on the ball also reassesses your goals every few weeks to keep you motivated.\\n\\n(cid:2) Listens to you: If you mention that an exercise doesn’t feel right, your\\n\\ntrainer should figure out why and show you an alternative move for the same body part. There’s no single exercise you absolutely must do. If you tell him you’re feeling stagnant, overtrained, or underchallenged, he should alter your program.\\n\\n54 Part I: Getting Your Butt off the Couch\\n\\n(cid:2) Teaches you to be independent: Ironically, good trainers train them-\\n\\nselves out of a job by teaching you how to do everything on your own. After a few months, you should be able to set the correct amount of weight, adjust the machines, use proper form, and modify your routine as needed. Of course, if you’d never exercise by yourself, you’re wel- come to hire your trainer for life; she’ll be glad to accommodate you. Regardless, you should know how to do everything on your own. This way, if you’re out of town on business or vacation, you can keep up your workouts at a hotel or local gym. And if, heaven forbid, your trainer goes on vacation, you won’t have an excuse to stop working out.\\n\\n(cid:2) Speaks English, not jargon: Some trainers say things like, “Your patella edema is a limiting factor in increasing your volume of oxygen uptake.” Translation: “You can’t run faster because you have bad knees.” If you can’t understand what your trainer is saying, find someone new. You shouldn’t expend extra energy just trying to figure out what the heck you’re being asked to do. Trainers with jargonitis tend to be really inse- cure. Occasionally, however, a small dose of fitness verbiage is good for you; a trainer may be trying to teach you something that you actually should know, like where your triceps are. (By the way, if you don’t know where your triceps are, read Chapter 12.)\\n\\nGetting the Most out of Your First Training Session\\n\\nEven with the guidance of a trainer, your first session may be a little awkward. One friend of ours says she just had to swallow her pride while trying out the weight machines for the first time. “Here was this cute, young trainer helping me climb onto the hamstring machine,” she remembers. “I felt like a 40-year- old woman trying to get on a horse for the first time. I’m lying on the bench with my butt in the air, and the trainer’s saying, ‘Keep your butt down.’ And I’m saying, ‘That’s as far down as it goes. It’s just big.’”\\n\\nHaving a good sense of humor can get you through a first workout session without any ego damage. So what if you sit backward on the shoulder machine? So what if you sink to the floor when you hop onto the stair-climber? Your trainer may as well earn his money showing you the right way to use the equipment.\\n\\nHere are some tips to help ease your anxiety and make your first session a productive one:\\n\\n(cid:2) Schedule the session at a time when the gym isn’t busy (any time\\n\\nother than weekday mornings or evenings). This way, you won’t have 12 other members clamoring to use the arm-curl machine while the trainer teaches you to adjust the seat.\\n\\nChapter 4: Hiring a Trainer\\n\\n55\\n\\n(cid:2) Take notes and draw pictures. During the session, your trainer should\\n\\nfill out a card listing each exercise in your program, how much weight to lift, and how many sets and reps to do. But if you supplement this infor- mation with your own notes, you may find it easier to remember what to do when you work out alone. For example, if your trainer writes “lat pull-down,” you can add, “pull bar down to chest; strengthens back muscles; adjust seat to second notch.” You may even want to sketch some of the machines so that when you work out by yourself, you won’t spend ten minutes searching for the right contraption. Some facilities number the machines to make them easier to remember and identify, too. Your trainer simply notes the machine number and the seat height. (cid:2) Ask lots of questions. Don’t be too intimidated to ask the trainer why he picked a particular chest exercise or for a reminder of where your delts are. No question is too stupid (unless you’re asking what time the 3 p.m. boxing class starts).\\n\\n(cid:2) Don’t expect to absorb everything your trainer tells you on the first day. Every time you work out, you’ll pick up more information, such as how to adjust each machine and how to stretch each muscle group. You can make things easier on yourself by scheduling a second training appointment to reinforce what you learned on the first go-around. Some gyms charge for a second appointment; some don’t. If you bring up the issue when you join the gym, some clubs may throw in a few extra train- ing sessions.\\n\\n(cid:2) Don’t try to impress the trainer by lifting too much. The trainer doesn’t expect you to be Arnold Schwarzenegger. One friend of ours lost any such illusions during his first session with a trainer. “I sat down on this machine and pulled the handles back, and the trainer said, ‘Do you feel that?’ I said, ‘Yeah, it’s really pulling on my muscles.’ Then the trainer said, ‘Oops, I forgot to put the weight on.’” When stuff like that happens, just laugh and realize that it doesn’t take much time to get stronger.\\n\\nBeing the Best Client You Can Be\\n\\nYou have the right to demand a lot from your trainer, but your trainer can also expect a certain level of courtesy, attention, and effort from you. Keep in mind the following rules of client etiquette. Some of these tips apply just to home trainers; others apply to trainers at a gym.\\n\\n(cid:2) Don’t show up at the door in your pajamas. Your trainer shouldn’t\\n\\nhave to serve as your alarm clock or wait a half-hour for you to get your act together. Like you, the trainer has a schedule, and time is money. If you’re late getting started, the trainer has every right to cut your ses- sion short or charge you extra.\\n\\n56 Part I: Getting Your Butt off the Couch\\n\\n(cid:2) Don’t answer your doorbell, phone, fax, pager, or e-mail. This just\\n\\nwastes the trainer’s time and distracts you from your workout. Also, if you have kids, make sure that someone is watching them. Your trainer won’t be happy if your 5-year-old runs into the room screaming, “Mommy! Mommy! My Scene Barbie is sick!”\\n\\n(cid:2) Don’t whine. Get yourself in a positive frame of mind before your\\n\\ntraining sessions.\\n\\nLiz used to train a woman who wanted to tone her legs but who hated to do leg exercises. While working out, she used to curse at Liz very loudly, to the point where people would turn around and stare. The management eventually asked Liz and her client to go elsewhere, but Liz refused to work with the client any longer.\\n\\n(cid:2) Schedule in advance. You’ll have a very happy trainer if you schedule a month in advance. (Just make sure that it’s a schedule you can stick to.) At the very least, don’t call in the morning and expect a session that afternoon.\\n\\nIf canceling or rescheduling, give your trainer as much time as possible. Many trainers have a 24-hour cancellation policy, which requires you to cancel or reschedule your session with at least 24 hours’ notice. This allows your trainer time to adjust his schedule and possibly fit someone else into that spot. It also helps keep a positive rapport with your trainer. (cid:2) Speak up. Just because you’ve hired a trainer doesn’t mean you’ve lost the power of speech. If something doesn’t feel right, say so. Your trainer isn’t a mind reader.\\n\\nOne woman we know severely pulled her inner-thigh muscles because a trainer went overboard on a stretch. Afterward, she said she felt pain for nearly a minute before she heard a loud pop. Why didn’t she say any- thing? Because she didn’t want to question the trainer. Granted, the trainer should have paid better attention, but he couldn’t have been expected to know how the woman felt.\\n\\n(cid:2) Keep the relationship professional. Your trainer isn’t your therapist. Inevitably, you’ll get into personal stuff; after all, this is your personal trainer. But don’t take your bad day out on your trainer, and don’t expect your trainer to fix your life. And never make a pass at your trainer, just as he or she shouldn’t be making a pass at you or making inappropriate comments.\\n\\nPart II Enjoying Total-Body Health: Eating Well and Staying Injury-Free\\n\\nIn this part . . . We tell you how to enjoy whole-body health, from\\n\\ninjury prevention to stretching to eating well.\\n\\nChapter 5 helps you prevent and treat common exercise injuries — and discover the difference between a sprain and a strain.\\n\\nWe also introduce you to the most neglected — and, per- haps most important — component of fitness: flexibility. In Chapter 6, we make a darn good case for taking ten min- utes out of each day to stretch. We also give you a rundown of the various stretching philosophies, cover the basic rules of stretching, and present a head-to-toe stretching workout that doesn’t require the flexibility of a Cirque du Soleil troupe member.\\n\\nChapter 7 fills you in on nutrition basics: You get the skinny on low-carb diets, low-fat eating, food pyramids, vitamin supplements, and phytochemicals (an important group of substances with long and unpronounceable names).\\n\\nChapter 5 This Doesn’t Have to Happen to You: Avoiding Common Injuries\\n\\nIn This Chapter (cid:1) Differentiating between good pain and bad pain (cid:1) Recognizing and treating exercise injuries\\n\\nSometimes, exercise hurts. If you never lift anything heavier than a tube of\\n\\nPringles potato chips and then start lifting dumbbells, naturally you’re going to feel some soreness. That type of pain is nothing to worry about. But, if you wake up the morning after a weight-lifting session and feel like your left arm has been shredded by a meat grinder, that’s a different story. This chap- ter tells you how to differentiate the two, how to take care of an injury, and how to prevent injuries in the first place.\\n\\nTaking Care of Common Injuries\\n\\nNormal pain is achy, dull, and very general. Usually, you feel it throughout an entire muscle or over a large area of your body. Bad pain — the type that signals injury — tends to be sharp and specific. It usually hurts when you do certain movements, like bending your knee or lifting your arm overhead. It’s important to recognize this type of pain and act accordingly. Not long ago, Suzanne ignored the shoulder pain that flared up after she performed certain chest exercises. Eventually, the pain got so bad — and her tendon so inflamed — that she couldn’t lift a pitcher of water without wincing. Suzanne was forced to take off three entire months from upper-body weight training, which made her grouchy and a real annoyance to her friends and kept her from improving her fitness level.\\n\\nYou can avoid a scenario like that if you follow the advice in this chapter, which covers injuries common to people who exercise. We tell you how to recognize and treat them — and how to prevent them from happening in the first place.\\n\\n60 Part II: Enjoying Total-Body Health: Eating Well and Staying Injury-Free\\n\\nStrains and sprains\\n\\nFirst, we should clear up some terminology. One of your coworkers may hobble into the office announcing he has “strained” a muscle — or maybe he says he has “pulled” a muscle. These terms are interchangeable, but they’re not synonymous with “sprain.”\\n\\nWhen you strain a muscle (commonly called a pulled muscle), you over-stretch or tear the tendon (the tough, cord-like end of the muscle that attaches to the bone). Strains happen when you push yourself harder than normal, like when you challenge your kid brother to a 100-yard dash. A sprain refers to a torn or overstretched ligament (the connective tissue that joins two bones together). You can sprain a joint — like when you turn your ankle while stepping off a curb — but you can’t sprain a muscle.\\n\\nTwo of the most commonly strained muscles are the hamstrings (rear thigh muscles) and groin (inner-thigh) muscles. (See Chapter 12 for pictures of and more information about these muscles.) These muscles often pull because they’re tight and because most people don’t take five minutes to warm up (that is, to ease into a workout by starting slowly and gradually increasing the tempo — see Chapter 8) before working out. You know you’ve strained your hamstring if a sharp pain shoots up the back of your thigh when you straighten your leg. You have a groin pull if a stabbing pain prevents you from lifting your leg in toward your other leg or out to the side. In both cases, you may feel a lump or a knot where the muscle has tightened up. Stop the offending activity for a few days until the muscle repairs itself. Otherwise, you may be headed for a full-blown tear, in which case you could be sidelined for several months instead of being laid up for a few days. Light stretching may be beneficial (see Chapter 6).\\n\\nTo speed up the healing process for a strain, apply ice to the injured area for the first 24 to 48 hours. (See the “RICE, RICE Baby” section in this chapter for icing tips.) Gentle — emphasis on gentle — massage may help work out muscle kinks. To prevent future pulls, carefully stretch your muscles every day, always after a thorough warm-up, and increase your exercise program on a gradual basis. Check your shoes, too. Athletic shoes with flared heels — heels that are wider on the bottom than on the top — may restrain your foot and ankle from normal movement. That, in turn, may cause your thigh mus- cles to tighten up. Shoes that are too big cause the same type of problem.\\n\\nSprains occur most commonly at the ankle. If you sprain your ankle badly, you may hear a loud pop or tearing sound when the injury happens. Usually you’re left with a bruise and swelling, and you can’t place any of your weight on the injured foot without pain. The treatment for a sprain is to keep your shoe on for as long as possible (this keeps the ankle from swelling), and then following the RICE formula (see the “RICE, RICE, Baby” section later in this chapter).\\n\\nChapter 5: This Doesn’t Have to Happen to You: Avoiding Common Injuries\\n\\n61\\n\\nShin splints\\n\\nShin splints is a catch-all term for shin pain, usually caused by a slight separa- tion between the shin muscle and the bone. You can develop shin splints from doing more exercise than your body is ready to handle or simply from introducing a new aspect to your training, such as wearing a new pair of shoes, running downhill, or running on the beach when you normally run on asphalt.\\n\\nTo cure shin splints, back off for a few days. When you’re free of pain, start back up gradually. Don’t increase your exercise time or distance by more than 10 percent a week (see Chapter 10). Ice helps by reducing inflammation and by dulling the pain. For shin splints, we recommend the ice massage method described in the “RICE, RICE, Baby” section. Also, gently but deeply massaging the area several times a day can help.\\n\\nTo prevent shin splints, strengthen your shin muscles so that they work more in harmony with your calves, the muscles that operate in opposition to them. Here’s one simple exercise: Stand on the floor or with your heels on the edge of a stair, with your weight distributed evenly over the entire length of your foot, and lift and lower your toes and the balls of your feet 20 to 30 times, as shown in Chapter 14. Ask a trainer to show you some other shin exercises. Stretching the calf muscles (see Chapter 6) also helps prevent injury to the shin and ankle.\\n\\nAlso, be sure to replace your athletic shoes often so your shins don’t take a pounding from lack of cushioning. We know one guy who solved his chronic shin splint problem overnight by buying a pair of shoes with a slightly wider heel. This seemed to suit his running style; a podiatrist or sports-medicine specialist (or even a well-informed running store associate) can help you find the solution that suits your style. If all else fails, your podiatrist may make a special pair of inserts, called orthotics, to properly position your feet in your shoes.\\n\\nAchilles tendonitis\\n\\nAchilles was the mighty Greek warrior whose mother had dipped him into the waters of the River Styx to make him invulnerable. The problem was, she missed a spot: the point on the back of his heel where she held him. This area, where the Achilles tendon connects to the heel, is a weak spot for just about anyone who happens to stand or move in an upright position, especially run- ners, walkers, in-line skaters, cyclists, and tennis players. When the Achilles tendon becomes swollen, sore, or inflamed, you have Achilles tendonitis.\\n\\n62 Part II: Enjoying Total-Body Health: Eating Well and Staying Injury-Free\\n\\nThe most common culprit is a calf muscle that’s too short and tight. A regular stretching program that focuses on your foot, calf, and hamstring muscles (see Chapter 6) goes a long way toward preventing the problem. Your old friend ice also can reduce swelling and relieve pain (see the “RICE, RICE Baby” section for details). If you wear high heels, wean yourself from them and switch to flats; heels can contribute to Achilles tendonitis by keeping your calves in a contracted (shortened) position for hours on end.\\n\\nFor chronic Achilles inflammation, the remedy that works best is something many die-hard exercisers don’t want to hear: Stop exercising. Give your Achilles tendon a few days off to rest and repair. Ice the spot, but don’t do any stretching or strengthening exercises that put pressure on your heel. (You can swim, but only if you feel no pain.) If your Achilles problem persists, see an orthopedist or a podiatrist. You may need more-aggressive remedies.\\n\\nKnee pain\\n\\nOn the surface, the knee seems to be a wonderfully uncomplicated mecha- nism with a pretty simple job description: to bend and straighten your leg. In reality, knee function is controlled by more muscles, tendons, ligaments, and cartilage than any other joint in your body. That’s one reason why it’s often the first joint to break down. The other is that the knees are involved in virtu- ally every sport or activity, making it the most common joint to suffer injury.\\n\\nKnee pain comes in more varieties than Baskin-Robbins ice cream. It can be caused by a tear in a ligament, a tendon, a muscle, or a piece of cartilage, the cushioning that prevents two bones from rubbing against each other. (See Chapter 12 for additional definitions of these high-tech terms.) We can’t diag- nose your specific ailment, but we can tell you this: Knee pain is often the result of doing the same movement over and over again. Typically, you can’t trace it to a specific incident; it’s more likely the result of one bike-a-thon or skate-a-thon too many. It’s also affected or caused by a lack of stability and strength in the hips.\\n\\nCross training is a good way to avoid knee pain. By varying your exercise activities — running one day, cycling the next — you use different muscles, or at least you use the same muscles in different ways. You can still injure your knees with a cross-training regimen, so be careful not to overdo it. If you do feel knee pain coming on, cut back on your exercise routine or switch to an activity that doesn’t aggravate the situation. Or, better yet, contact a quali- fied personal trainer to ensure that your form and technique are correct — improper technique is often the cause of joint problems. Some people with knee problems from running can bicycle with no pain whatsoever, and vice versa. Ice is always a good choice, too. But don’t mess around here. If pain persists, recurs frequently, or is caused by a single incident, get thee to a doctor ASAP.\\n\\nChapter 5: This Doesn’t Have to Happen to You: Avoiding Common Injuries\\n\\n63\\n\\nStress fractures\\n\\nThe first large group of modern-day athletes to experience stress fractures were soldiers in World War II. The Army took out-of-shape civilians, placed heavy packs on their backs, and sent them off to march for miles in heavy combat boots. Soon the rookies complained about foot pain, but because nothing showed up on X-rays, doctors assumed they were faking it. Often, a second X-ray was taken several weeks later, revealing a fuzziness along the bone. Bone callus (a build-up of bone material) was forming; the healing process had started. Today, long-distance runners, hikers, backpackers, and in-line skaters are the most common sufferers of stress fractures.\\n\\nStress fractures are typically not one but a series of micro-fractures or hairline breaks that run along the bone. Typically, you don’t have a telltale snap or pop that occurs in other breaks. More often, you wake up one day with pain radiating down the top of one or two of your toes to the center of your foot or along your shinbone. You may feel pain when you walk. You may even notice redness or swelling on top of your foot. When you press your finger on that spot, you feel a stabbing pain that immediately grabs your attention. The front of the shin is also a likely place for a fracture accompanied by the trademark pinpoint of pain.\\n\\nDon’t try to treat this kind of pain yourself. It definitely warrants a visit to your orthopedist or podiatrist, who will X-ray your foot to make sure that your injury is a stress fracture. The doctor will probably prescribe anti-inflammatory medication, ice, and elevation, and implore you to stay off your feet. In extreme cases, he may even put you in a soft or hard cast.\\n\\nIf you think you have a stress fracture, stop exercising immediately. We can’t tell you how many times marathoners in agonizing foot pain at mile nine go on to finish the race anyway. When you continue to run on a stress fracture, you transform a minor injury into one that can take months to heal.\\n\\nLower-back pain\\n\\nNearly 80 percent of people utter the words “Oh, my aching back,” at some point in their adult lives. You may be referring to a nagging stiffness that makes tying your shoes a difficult proposition, or you may be referring to chronic, debilitating pain that keeps you curled up in bed for weeks at a time. Although regular workouts (especially abdominal and back exercises) can do a lot to help prevent back pain, fitness activities can also cause back problems, particularly if you do a lot of pounding or use improper form when you run or cycle. You also can wrench your back by failing to bend your legs when you lift a weight off the rack.\\n\\n64 Part II: Enjoying Total-Body Health: Eating Well and Staying Injury-Free\\n\\nOf course, you also can throw out your back by doing completely nonathletic activities, such as improperly lifting a child or a bag of groceries. Always use proper form (lifting and bending with your legs, not your back), when lifting and carrying anything.\\n\\nIn many instances of back pain, the worst thing you can do is just stay in bed. This weakens the very muscles that need to be loosened up and strength- ened (and lack of activity may have led to the back pain in the first place). Another time-honored treatment, the heating pad, makes many back condi- tions worse by further inflaming the nerves.\\n\\nSo what helps back pain heal? Time, for one thing. Many cases of back pain disappear within four weeks without any treatment at all. If that doesn’t work, you can see a variety of professionals. Most experts believe that the majority of back pain is muscular in nature and can be treated successfully with nonsurgical procedures, such as exercise, massage, physical therapy, and chiropractic. (To find a good chiropractor, get a recommendation from a friend, or better yet, from a medical doctor.) Swimming, walking, and yoga seem to be the best activities for limbering up tight back muscles. Back and abdominal strengthening exercises supervised by a physical therapist or trainer experienced in dealing with back pain can give you long-term immunity from further recurrence of back pain. For helpful back stretches, see Chapter 6.\\n\\nFor an episode you’re having right now, ice and gentle movement are probably your best bet for relief. Some experts recommend seeing a physiatrist, a med- ical doctor who rehabilitates the disabled. Physiatrists are more likely to pre- scribe exercise than medication or surgery. If you experience severe back pain that prevents you from going about your normal activities, see your physician first to rule out any underlying medical causes, such as kidney infections or intestinal disorders.\\n\\nDon’t ignore the symptoms, like Liz’s husband, Jay, once did. One night Jay woke up in the middle of the night to get some ice but got so dizzy from his back pain that he fainted. When he hit the floor, Liz woke up and found him lying in the hallway, blood dripping from his mouth. Liz thought he had been shot. For the next two days, Jay was confined to bed because he couldn’t walk. His cut lip didn’t feel too good, either.\\n\\nTennis elbow\\n\\nYou don’t need to be a tennis player to experience a tenderness on the bony bump on the outside of your elbow or an aching sensation whenever you straighten your arm or pick up an object. In fact, tennis elbow (inflammation of the tendons in your elbow) can be caused by carrying a gym bag or brief- case with a straight arm or by lifting weights or any heavy object with improper form.\\n\\nChapter 5: This Doesn’t Have to Happen to You: Avoiding Common Injuries\\n\\n65\\n\\nWhen you lift weights or use a stair-climber, take care not to lock your elbows. This is a very common mistake, and the people who do it often fail to make the connection between their elbow pain and their sloppy form.\\n\\nIf you feel pain in your elbow, stop the offending activity. Ice can help, and you can buy a brace or slip-on wrap at the drugstore to help support your elbow. Your doctor may even suggest that you wear the brace while you sleep, to keep up continuous compression on your elbow joint. To help pre- vent future episodes of tennis elbow, strengthen your wrists (forearms) and your triceps, the muscles at the back of your arm (see Chapter 12 for more information on tricep muscles; see Chapter 14 for a tricep-building exercise). Strong wrists are particularly important because most elbow pain is caused by swollen tendons that originate in the wrists and end in the elbow (see Chapter 14).\\n\\nTo prevent tennis elbow, lift objects with your palm facing your body. Also try doing strengthening exercises with hand weights: With your elbow cocked and your palm down, repeatedly bend your wrist, stopping if you feel any pain. Stretch the muscles in and around the elbow before beginning a poten- tially stressful activity by grasping the top part of your fingers and gently but firmly pulling them back toward your body, while keeping your arm fully extended and your palm facing outward.\\n\\nNeck pain\\n\\nYou may not realize how useful your neck is until you can’t move it, like when the guy standing next to you asks a question, and answering him requires a three-quarter turn of your body.\\n\\nJust about anything can cause neck pain — you may sleep on your neck in a funny way or spend too much time cradling the phone on your shoulder. But neck pain is often caused by fitness activities. We’re talking about poor weight-lifting technique, such as turning your head to the side while doing a shoulder press, and poor upper-body exercise posture, such as letting your head droop forward when you walk. If you experience neck pain after a trau- matic incident, such as getting beaned on the head with a soccer ball, check with your doctor immediately. Also consult a physician if you have constant or recurring neck pain.\\n\\nNeck pain of the non-traumatic kind usually signals tightness in the muscles of your neck, upper back, and/or shoulders. When you press a finger into the area between your shoulder and your neck and there’s very little give or springiness, you have tight neck muscles. One remedy: Gently stretch your neck muscles; if you feel tightness on the right side of your neck, tip your head toward your left shoulder and stretch your right arm downward. See\\n\\n66 Part II: Enjoying Total-Body Health: Eating Well and Staying Injury-Free\\n\\nChapter 6 for details. Gentle massage is also useful for freeing up knotty neck muscles. You can give yourself a massage, but somehow that isn’t as satisfy- ing as enlisting a friend, significant other, or professional therapist.\\n\\nIce, usually an injury-friendly treatment, isn’t always the best choice for neck pain. If you’re stiff to begin with, applying ice may cause you to tense up even more. If your trouble is a stiff neck, moist heat in the form of a warm wash- cloth, shower massage, or whirlpool may be the way to go.\\n\\nRotator-cuff injuries\\n\\nWhat’s the capital of Belgium? If you can’t raise your hand to answer that question, you may have a rotator-cuff tear. Throwing, catching, and lifting your arm to the side may also be painful. (By the way, the answer is Brussels.)\\n\\nThe rotator cuff is a group of four muscles that surround and protect your shoulder joint (see Chapter 12 for details about the muscles in your body, if you’re interested). They’re particularly delicate and susceptible to injury. They can tear if your arm is violently pulled or twisted or if you fall with your arm outstretched. But the most likely scenario is damage from repetitive movements such as throwing, catching, swimming, and lifting weights that are too heavy. Which movements cause pain depends on which rotator-cuff muscle you damage and how badly you injure it. Rotator-cuff tears are often the reason for the early retirement of baseball players and weekend softball players alike.\\n\\nThese injuries usually are treated with ice and compression (see the “RICE, RICE Baby” section later in this chapter), plus strength-training exercises using very light weights. Ease up on hard-core weight-training exercises, particularly heavy bench pressing, both on a flat and an incline bench, and ask a trainer to check your form. Reeducate yourself on throwing, catching, or swim stroke technique — make sure to involve your entire body rather than just your arm and shoulder. In some cases, the rotator cuff is too far gone to strengthen through exercise, and the damaged muscle needs surgical repair or, at the very least, physical therapy.\\n\\nChafing\\n\\nYour legs feel great, and you’ve barely broken a sweat, yet you can’t continue your bike ride because your butt is rubbed raw. You have what’s essentially a case of adult diaper rash, an irritation that can crop up anywhere your cloth- ing touches your skin and is known as chafing. It’s particularly common in hot\\n\\nChapter 5: This Doesn’t Have to Happen to You: Avoiding Common Injuries\\n\\n67\\n\\nweather, when heavy sweating contributes to the problem. Every sport has special hot spots to look out for. The bra line, underarms, and sock line are the most common among runners. But you can also get chafed if your tights, shorts, or shirt rub against your skin as you move. Only streakers are immune.\\n\\nYou can also develop a similar condition, blisters (a small buildup of water or blood under your skin), when your feet rub against the seams in your shoes, slide around in too-loose shoes, or feel friction against too-tight or bunched- up socks. Small, deep blisters and large blisters are not only painful — they can keep you off your feet and knock you off your training routine for days at a time.\\n\\nTo prevent chafing, experiment with fabrics and cuts of clothing that don’t irritate your skin. Softer fabrics that include at least some cotton tend to be the kindest to your skin, but it’s a matter of personal preference. To prevent chafing or blisters, before your workout, try greasing up your hot spots with Vaseline or with a product like Sportslick or BodyGlide, all-purpose skin lubri- cants that lasts longer than Vaseline and won’t come off until you wash with soap and water. (Check with your local running or walking store; some all- purpose sporting-goods stores also carry these products.) Long-distance cyclists also slather their butts with udder balm, an ointment made for cows but helpful for reducing chafing in humans. It feels kind of icky, but it usually does the trick.\\n\\nWe know one runner who used to get a severe case of irritation on his nipples. He solved this with the strategic placement of Band-Aids. Not very macho, but then, neither were the two spots of blood leaking through his shirt.\\n\\nRICE, RICE Baby\\n\\nIf your doctor or trainer prescribes RICE for an injury, he isn’t suggesting some New Age nutritional treatment. He’s referring to the common way to treat sports injuries: Rest, Ice, Compression, and Elevation. Usually, this treatment is all you need to get back on your feet, particularly if you RICE diligently for the first 48 hours after an injury.\\n\\nRest\\n\\nStop doing activities that aggravate your injury. (If you sprain your ankle, don’t try to “walk it off.”) Rest can often mean the difference between an injury that heals right away and one that nags you for months. But don’t use\\n\\n68 Part II: Enjoying Total-Body Health: Eating Well and Staying Injury-Free\\n\\nyour injury as an excuse to quit exercising altogether. Simply choose an activ- ity that doesn’t hurt. If you pull a hamstring, you don’t have to stop upper- body weight training. Swimming is also often a great activity when injured, unless, of course, your injury is swimming-related.\\n\\nIce\\n\\nIce reduces swelling and deadens pain by constricting blood flow into the injured area. Ice for 15 to 20 minutes three or four times a day for as long as you feel pain. Contrary to popular belief, ice is not useless after the first day. You can apply ice with a pack, a plastic bag full of cubes, or a package of frozen corn. Just don’t allow the ice to rest directly on your skin; otherwise, you’re inviting a whole new list of problems, such as ice burns. Instead, put a thin, damp washcloth between your skin and the ice.\\n\\nOne of our favorite icing techniques is ice massage. Fill a paper cup 3⁄4 full of water and stick it in the freezer. When the water freezes, peel the cup down so you have what resembles an ice cream cone of ice. Use this to massage the injured area in a circular motion for as long as you can take it, usually four or five minutes. Ice massage penetrates deeper into your muscles than passively throwing an ice pack over the injured area. Be sure to keep the ice moving.\\n\\nCompression\\n\\nPut pressure on the injured area to keep the swelling down. Wrap a damp ACE Brand bandage around the injury, or buy a special knee, elbow, or wrist wrap or brace. Wrap tightly enough so that you feel some tension but not so firmly that you cut off your circulation or feel numbness.\\n\\nElevation\\n\\nElevating your injured body part reduces swelling by allowing fluids and waste products to drain from the area, much like water runs downstream. (Waste products are the bits of broken blood cells and other inflammatory agents hanging around the injury.) If your ankle is injured, you don’t need to raise it so high that it’s perpendicular to the ground. Propping it up on a couple of fluffy pillows will do. Elevation works best when used in conjunc- tion with the rest of the RICE treatment.\\n\\nChapter 6 The Scoop on Stretching\\n\\nIn This Chapter (cid:1) Understanding the benefits of stretching (cid:1) Knowing when to stretch (cid:1) Going through a stretching routine (cid:1) Investigating alternatives to traditional stretching\\n\\ndedicated athletes we know hate to stretch. And prominent stretching researchers have admitted to us that they have trouble getting motivated to stretch — despite the fact that their own studies demonstrate the importance of flexibility training. The designer of a popular stretching device even admit- ted to Liz that he usually skips the stretching part of his workout. “Because stretching doesn’t help you lose weight or make your muscles bigger, it’s the first thing to go when you’re short on time,” he said.\\n\\nIf you’re like most people, stretching ranks right up there with flossing and\\n\\noven cleaning on your list of least-favorite activities. Many of the most\\n\\nTrue, stretching won’t burn many calories or sculpt you a physique like Brad Pitt’s, but a few minutes of daily stretching is a very wise investment. So, in this chapter, we explain what stretching can do for you, give you the lowdown on several different stretching methods — including the very-hot method called Active Isolated stretching — and show you some basic stretches that you can use right away.\\n\\nWhy You Need to Stretch\\n\\nStretching is the key to maintaining your flexibility — in other words, how far and how easily you can move your joints. As you get older, your tendons (the tissues that connect muscle to bone) begin to shorten and tighten, restricting your flexibility. Your movement becomes slower and less fluid. You don’t stand up as straight. You walk more stiffly and with a shorter stride. You find it more difficult to step up to a curb or bend down to pick up the trash. Stretching your rear thigh, hip, and calf muscles can make a big difference.\\n\\n70 Part II: Enjoying Total-Body Health: Eating Well and Staying Injury-Free\\n\\nFlexibility is one of the keys to good posture. When your front neck muscles are short and tight, your head angles forward. When your shoulders and chest are tight, your shoulders round inward. When your lower back, rear thigh, and hip muscles are tight, the curve of your back becomes exaggerated. A regular stretching routine also can reduce pain and discomfort, particularly in your lower back. In fact, the pain often disappears when you begin doing simple stretches for your lower-back and rear-thigh muscles.\\n\\nWhat’s more, flexibility exercises can correct muscle imbalances. Say that your front-thigh muscles are strong, but your rear thighs are tight and weak. (This is a common scenario.) As a result, you end up relying on your front thighs more than you should. Chances are, you won’t even notice this, but it will throw off your movement in subtle ways — you may have a short walking stride or bounce too high off the ground. Muscle imbalances can eventually lead to injuries such as pulled muscles. They also contribute to clumsiness, which in itself can lead to injury. Finally, if you’re any kind of a jock — even a bowler or a Saturday-afternoon softball player — stretching may help you perform better. The ability to move freely in a wide variety of directions makes you a better athlete.\\n\\nBefore, After, During? Knowing When to Stretch\\n\\nContrary to popular opinion, stretching is not the first thing you should do when you walk into the gym or arrive at the park for a jog. Don’t stretch your muscles until you’ve at least warmed up thoroughly (see Chapter 8 for warm- up basics); we think stretching at the end of your workout, after you’ve finished your workout but before you shower, is even better. A post-workout stretch is a great way to relax and ease back into the rest of your day and has been shown to reduce injuries.\\n\\nCan stretching prevent injury?\\n\\nA recent study showing no link between stretching and injury rates has bolstered non- stretchers’ self-confidence. Don’t be too sur- prised if, while stretching at your gym, someone lectures you on how you’re wasting your time.\\n\\nBut before you throw stretching out the window altogether, consider that what this study showed was that warming up with stretch- ing does not reduce injuries. As we clearly\\n\\nrecommend in this chapter, you don’t want to stretch before you work out, but after. (Although you want to ease into any workout by doing a full warm-up — see Chapter 8.) Research actu- ally shows that, although runners who stretch before they work out have higher injury rates compared to runners who don’t stretch at all, those who stretch after workouts have lower rates of injury.\\n\\nChapter 6: The Scoop on Stretching\\n\\n71\\n\\nDon’t stretch before you cool down (see Chapter 8 for more on cooldowns). Putting your head below your heart right after a workout can cause fainting and nausea. Wait until your heart rate dips below 100 or you aren’t feeling breathless before you lie down to stretch.\\n\\nFollowing a Few Rules of Stretching\\n\\nWatch runners at the park or weight lifters at the gym. Chances are, they have the wrong idea about stretching. Maybe they’ll grab their heel for a split second to stretch their front thigh, or bend over for a moment to touch their toes. Liz recently saw a very short woman wind up and throw her leg onto the hood of a very tall car. The sight made Liz cringe with fear for the woman’s hamstring. That sort of “stretching” isn’t going to make you more flexible, and it may even injure you.\\n\\nHere are the basic rules for a useful and safe flexibility workout:\\n\\n(cid:2) Stretch as often as you can — daily, if possible. Always stretch after every workout, both cardiovascular and strength training. When you stretch on days you don’t work out, be sure to warm up with a few min- utes of easy movement like shoulder rolls, gentle waist twists, or light cardio activity.\\n\\n(cid:2) Move into each stretching position slowly. Never force yourself into\\n\\na stretch by jerking or snapping into position.\\n\\n(cid:2) Notice how much tension you feel. A stretch should rate anywhere from mild tension to the edge of discomfort on your pain meter. It should never cause severe or sharp pain anywhere else in your body. Focus on the area you’re stretching, and notice the stretch spread through these muscles.\\n\\n(cid:2) Never bounce. No matter which type of stretching you choose (tradi-\\n\\ntional, PNF, or AI — see the “Finding Alternative Ways to Stretch” section) after you find the most comfortable stretch position, stay there or grad- ually deepen the stretch. Bouncing only tightens your muscle — it doesn’t loosen it. Forceful bouncing increases the risk of tearing a muscle.\\n\\n(cid:2) As you hold each position, take at least two deep breaths. Deep breath-\\n\\ning promotes relaxation.\\n\\nA Simple Stretching Routine\\n\\nIn the following sections, we show you a thorough, basic stretching routine to get you started. If you consider stretching too boring, too painful, or too complicated, you’ll like this section. It features a no-brainer stretching routine that won’t pull your hamstrings like a rope in a tug of war. Although we like\\n\\n72 Part II: Enjoying Total-Body Health: Eating Well and Staying Injury-Free\\n\\nalternative stretching techniques such as AI and PNF (described in the follow- ing section), in this section, we demonstrate classic stretches because they’re the type most fitness experts recommend. After you master these moves, the workout should take about five minutes.\\n\\nKeep in mind that this is just a starting point. We think it’s a great idea to learn additional stretches; there are literally hundreds to choose from. Varying your flexibility routine allows you to stretch your muscles at a number of angles. Plus, you’ll be able to give the necessary extra attention to the mus- cles you use most in your particular workout. For example, if you’re a tennis player or rower, you may want to do a few extra upper-body stretches. If you’re a runner, do a few additional hamstring and lower-back stretches. If you’re a cyclist, emphasize your quadriceps and glutes.\\n\\nNeck stretch\\n\\nThis stretch is designed to loosen and relax the muscles in your neck.\\n\\nStand or sit comfortably. Drop your left ear toward your left shoulder, and gently stretch your right arm down and a few inches out to the side (see Figure 6-1), using your opposite hand to assist the stretch by gently pulling on the side of your head. Repeat the stretch on your right side.\\n\\nKeep these tips in mind as you perform the neck stretch:\\n\\n(cid:2) Keep your shoulders down and relaxed. (cid:2) Your ear may or may not touch your shoulder, depending on how\\n\\nstiff you are.\\n\\nFigure 6-1: The neck stretch loosens and relaxes the muscles in your neck.\\n\\nPhotograph by Sunstreak Productions, Inc.\\n\\nChapter 6: The Scoop on Stretching\\n\\n73\\n\\nChest expansion\\n\\nThis stretch targets your shoulders, chest, and arms and helps promote good posture.\\n\\nSit or stand up tall and bring your arms behind you, clasping one hand inside the other (see Figure 6-2). Lift your chest and raise your arms slightly. You should feel a mild stretch spread across your chest.\\n\\nKeep in mind the following tips as you perform the chest expansion:\\n\\n(cid:2) Resist arching your lower back as you pull your arms upward. (cid:2) Try to keep your shoulders relaxed and down. (cid:2) Don’t force your arms up higher than is comfortable.\\n\\nFigure 6-2: The chest expansion promotes good posture.\\n\\nPhotograph by Sunstreak Productions, Inc.\\n\\nBack expansion\\n\\nThis move stretches and loosens your shoulders, arms, upper-back, and lower-back muscles.\\n\\n74 Part II: Enjoying Total-Body Health: Eating Well and Staying Injury-Free\\n\\nStanding tall with your knees slightly bent and feet hip-width apart, lift your arms in front of you to shoulder height. Clasp one hand in the other. Drop your head toward your chest, pull your abdominals inward, round your lower back, and tuck your hips forward so that you create a C shape with your torso. Stretch your arms forward so that you feel your shoulder blades moving apart and you create an “opposition” to your rounded back. You should feel a mild stretch slowly spread through your back and shoulders. (See Figure 6-3.)\\n\\nKeep in mind the following tips as you perform the back expansion:\\n\\n(cid:2) Keep your abdominal muscles pulled inward to protect your lower back. (cid:2) Lean only as far forward as you feel comfortable and balanced. (cid:2) Keep your shoulders down and relaxed.\\n\\nFigure 6-3: The back expansion stretches your shoulders, arms, and back.\\n\\nPhotograph by Sunstreak Productions, Inc.\\n\\nStanding hamstring stretch\\n\\nThis is a great stretch for your hamstrings (rear-thigh muscles) and your lower back. If you have lower-back problems, do the same exercise while lying on your back on the floor and extending your leg upward.\\n\\nStand tall with your left foot a few inches in front of your right foot and your left toes lifted. Bend your right knee slightly and pull your abdominals gently inward. Lean forward from your hips, and rest both palms on top of your\\n\\nChapter 6: The Scoop on Stretching\\n\\n75\\n\\nright thigh for balance and support (see Figure 6-4). Keep your shoulders down and relaxed; don’t round your lower back. You should feel a mild pull gradually spread through the back of your leg. Repeat the stretch with your right leg forward.\\n\\nKeep in mind the following tips as you perform the standing hamstring stretch:\\n\\n(cid:2) Keep your back straight and your abs pulled inward to make the stretch\\n\\nmore effective and to protect your lower back.\\n\\n(cid:2) Don’t lean so far forward that you lose your balance or feel strain in\\n\\nyour lower back.\\n\\nFigure 6-4: The standing hamstring stretch targets your rear-thigh muscles.\\n\\nPhotograph by Sunstreak Productions, Inc.\\n\\nStanding quad stretch\\n\\nThis stretch focuses on the quadriceps (front-thigh muscles). Be extra gentle with this stretch if you’re prone to knee or lower-back pain. If back pain is an issue for you, you can do a similar stretch while lying on your side, bending your top knee, and bringing your heel toward your buttocks.\\n\\n76 Part II: Enjoying Total-Body Health: Eating Well and Staying Injury-Free\\n\\nStand tall with your feet hip-width apart, pull your abdominals in, and relax your shoulders. Bend your left leg, bringing your heel toward your butt, and grasp your left foot with your right hand (see Figure 6-5) or with your left hand, if the opposite hand is too uncomfortable. You should feel a mild pull gradually spread through the front of your left leg. Then switch legs.\\n\\nKeep these tips in mind as you perform the standing quad stretch:\\n\\n(cid:2) Hold onto a chair or the wall if you have trouble balancing. (cid:2) Don’t lock the knee of your base leg.\\n\\nFigure 6-5: The standing quad stretch targets your front-thigh muscles.\\n\\nPhotograph by Sunstreak Productions, Inc.\\n\\nDouble calf stretch\\n\\nThis stretch offers some relief for the calf muscles, which tend to be tight and bunched up from daily activities such as walking and standing.\\n\\nStand with your feet together about 2 feet from a wall that you’re facing. Pull your abdominals gently inward and don’t round your lower back. With straight arms, press your palms into the wall and lean forward from your ankles, keeping your heels pressed as close to the floor as possible (see Figure 6-6). You should feel a mild stretch spread through your calf muscles.\\n\\nChapter 6: The Scoop on Stretching\\n\\n77\\n\\nKeep in mind the following tips as you perform the double calf stretch:\\n\\n(cid:2) Keep both heels flat on the floor or as close to the floor as your\\n\\nflexibility allows.\\n\\n(cid:2) Keep your abs pulled in to prevent your lower back from sagging\\n\\nor arching.\\n\\n(cid:2) To increase the stretch, bend your elbows, leaning your chest toward\\n\\nthe wall.\\n\\nFigure 6-6: The double calf stretch helps relieve tightness in your calf muscles.\\n\\nPhotograph by Sunstreak Productions, Inc.\\n\\nHorse biting tail\\n\\nThis movement stretches your abdominals, sides, and lower back. Take care not to force this stretch, especially if you have lower-back problems.\\n\\nKneel on your hands and knees so that your palms are directly beneath your shoulders and your knees are directly below your hips. Pull your abdominals gently inward so that your back neither sags nor arches. Slowly twist your spine to the left as much as your flexibility allows, so that you’re looking back over your shoulder toward your left buttock, and your left buttock moves slightly forward (see Figure 6-7). You should feel a mild stretch spread through your spine. Slowly move back to center and repeat to the right.\\n\\n78 Part II: Enjoying Total-Body Health: Eating Well and Staying Injury-Free\\n\\nKeep in mind the following tips as you perform this stretch:\\n\\n(cid:2) Keep your abs pulled in to prevent your lower back from sagging. (cid:2) Don’t force the stretch.\\n\\nFigure 6-7: The horse biting tail stretches your abdominals, sides, and lower back.\\n\\nPhotograph by Sunstreak Productions, Inc.\\n\\nButterfly stretch\\n\\nThis exercise stretches your inner thighs, groin, hips, and lower back. If you are prone to lower-back discomfort, take extra care to lean forward from your hips rather than rounding your lower back. This exercise may also cause some knee discomfort.\\n\\nSit up tall with the soles of your feet pressed together and your knees dropped to the sides as far as they will comfortably go. Pull your abdominals gently inward and lean forward from your hips. Grasp your feet with your hands and carefully pull yourself a small way farther forward (see Figure 6-8). You should feel the stretch spread throughout your inner thighs, the outermost part of your hips, and lower back.\\n\\nKeep in mind these tips as you perform the butterfly:\\n\\n(cid:2) Increase the stretch by carefully pressing your thighs toward the floor as\\n\\nyou hold the position.\\n\\n(cid:2) Don’t hunch your shoulders up toward your ears or round your back. (cid:2) To reduce stress on your knees, move your feet away from your body.\\n\\nTo increase the stretch, move your feet toward your body.\\n\\nChapter 6: The Scoop on Stretching\\n\\n79\\n\\nFigure 6-8: The butterfly stretch targets your inner thighs, groin, hips, and lower back.\\n\\nPhotograph by Sunstreak Productions, Inc.\\n\\nFinding Alternative Ways to Stretch\\n\\nTraditional stretching — holding a position for 10 to 30 seconds — isn’t the only way to make your muscles more flexible. Here’s a look at a few other popular methods.\\n\\nActive Isolated stretching\\n\\nSome exercise experts theorize that conventional stretching techniques can damage muscles by pulling on them too hard, too far, and for too long, caus- ing muscles to tighten up and spring back to prevent ripping and tearing. This automatic defense mechanism has many technical names too long to pronounce, but in laymen’s terms, it’s referred to as the rebound reflex.\\n\\nActive Isolated stretching, or AI, is a method designed to avoid the rebound reflex. To do an AI stretch, using a rope or stretch band, you tighten the muscle opposite the muscle you’re targeting for a stretch and then move the targeted muscle into a stretched position and hold it for about two seconds — that’s right, two seconds — just long enough to elongate the muscle without trig- gering the rebound reflex. The theory is that when you contract, or shorten, a muscle, the opposite muscle has no recourse but to relax and lengthen. You repeat the process 8 to 12 times in each position before moving on to the next stretch.\\n\\n80 Part II: Enjoying Total-Body Health: Eating Well and Staying Injury-Free\\n\\nLittle research has been conducted yet on AI, but we think this method works, and we particularly like it for people who don’t exactly have the flexibility of a ballerina. When you’re very inflexible, holding a stretch for even ten seconds can seem like a lifetime. We also like the fact that there is a reliable certifica- tion program for AI, offered by New York City exercise physiologists Jim and Phil Wharton and their company, Maximum Performance. Maximum Performance has certified thousands of trainers nationwide. Look for these trainers, who can either teach group classes or do one-on-one instruction. Also pick up The Whartons’ Stretch Book, which takes you step-by-step through an Active Isolated stretching routine.\\n\\nTo use the AI method, lie on your back and bend your right leg so that you can wrap a towel or rope around the instep of your right foot. (Buy boating rope at your local hardware store and have them seal the ends; buy a length that’s about twice your height.) Then proceed with the instructions in this section; at the end of the movement, while your leg is still straight, use the rope to actively pull your leg toward your torso into a stretch, holding for about two seconds before releasing.\\n\\nHamstring stretch To stretch your hamstrings (rear thigh muscles), with your rope around your right foot, lie on your back, keeping your left leg straight or slightly bent, and follow these steps:\\n\\n1. Straighten your right leg, lock your right knee, and using your rope,\\n\\npull your right leg up toward your chest (see Figure 6-9).\\n\\nFigure 6-9: Hamstring stretch (straight knee).\\n\\nPhotograph by C.D. Stouffer, Detroit\\n\\nChapter 6: The Scoop on Stretching\\n\\n81\\n\\n2. Hold for two seconds, and then release, allowing your right leg to\\n\\nrelax for a few seconds.\\n\\n3. Repeat Steps 1 and 2 for a total of eight to ten counts.\\n\\nIf necessary, do an additional set of eight to ten repetitions.\\n\\nQuadriceps stretch You may not even know your quads (thigh muscles) are tight, but as soon as you do this stretch, you’ll know. Although you may feel like a contortionist, work through the following steps to get a fantastic stretch in your quads:\\n\\n1. With your rope wrapped around your right foot, lie on your left side.\\n\\n2. Bend your left leg and pull it up toward your chest and chin.\\n\\nThe quadriceps of your left leg should be parallel to the top of your head.\\n\\n3. Bend your right leg and pull your right foot toward your butt.\\n\\n4. Pull the rope over your head and hold for two seconds (see\\n\\nFigure 6-10).\\n\\n5. Release, allowing your right leg to relax for a few seconds.\\n\\n6. Repeat Steps 2 through 5 for a total of eight to ten counts.\\n\\nIf necessary, do an additional set of eight to ten repetitions.\\n\\nFigure 6-10: Quadriceps stretch.\\n\\nPhotograph by C.D. Stouffer, Detroit\\n\\n82 Part II: Enjoying Total-Body Health: Eating Well and Staying Injury-Free\\n\\nCalf stretch To keep your calves loose and supple, sit up and wrap the rope around your right foot (left foot bent or straight — makes no difference), and then follow these steps:\\n\\n1. Lock your right knee and pull your right foot straight back toward\\n\\nyour chest.\\n\\n2. Lean your upper body forward (toward your lower leg) about 10\\n\\ndegrees and hold for two seconds (see Figure 6-11).\\n\\nThis leaning-forward part is critical. If you simply pull your foot toward your chest without the forward lean, you won’t get much of a stretch.\\n\\n3. Release, allowing your right leg to relax for a few seconds.\\n\\n4. Repeat Steps 1 through 3 for a total of eight to ten counts.\\n\\nIf necessary, do an additional set of eight to ten repetitions.\\n\\nFigure 6-11: Calf stretch.\\n\\nPhotograph by C.D. Stouffer, Detroit\\n\\nPNF\\n\\nIf you have a trainer or go to a gym, you may come across a stretching tech- nique with a name that, in our opinion, sets a new standard for fitness jargon: proprioceptive neuromuscular facilitation — PNF for short.\\n\\nChapter 6: The Scoop on Stretching\\n\\n83\\n\\nPNF involves tightening a muscle as hard as you can right before you stretch it. PNF is most often used for stretching the hamstrings. You lie on your back with your heel resting on your trainer’s shoulder and your leg almost straight. To exhaust your hamstrings, you press your heel into the trainer’s shoulder, while he pushes his shoulder into your heel. You hold this position for five to ten seconds. Then, you relax and hold the stretch for about 15 seconds. You may repeat the whole push/relax scenario three or four times.\\n\\nYou can do a PNF hamstring stretch yourself by lying in the same position and wrapping a towel around your ankle and holding an end in each hand. The theory behind PNF is that the act of tightening, or squeezing, causes a reflex in the muscle so that it becomes relaxed and more “receptive” to the stretch. So, after you tighten your hamstring for a few seconds, you’re able to stretch it a little bit further than usual immediately after you release the tension. Many experts also feel that having someone push the stretch just a little bit further than you’re likely to do yourself gets better results.\\n\\nDoes PNF work? Research does look promising. We know many trainers — and clients — who swear by PNF. Some gyms offer 45-minute private training sessions entirely devoted to this type of stretching.\\n\\n84 Part II: Enjoying Total-Body Health: Eating Well and Staying Injury-Free\\n\\nChapter 7 Nutrition Basics\\n\\nIn This Chapter (cid:1) Counting calories (cid:1) Understanding the balance of fat, carbs, and protein (cid:1) Developing healthy eating habits (cid:1) Eating your way up a food pyramid (cid:1) Meshing your eating schedule with your workouts (cid:1) Taking in enough fluids (cid:1) Getting the lowdown on supplements\\n\\nNot long ago, we came across a fitness book that proclaimed, “A great\\n\\nthat just isn’t so.\\n\\nexercise program can make up for lack of a great diet.” Unfortunately,\\n\\nBut wait — if you scarf an extra donut at the office, can’t you just burn off the calories on the treadmill? Sure, except that it takes an entire hour of brisk walking to burn off that single honey-dipped cruller. On a daily basis, exercise isn’t a realistic way to make up for overeating. Besides, weight control isn’t the only reason you should watch what you eat. If you make consistently poor choices, you deprive your body of nutrients that fight cancer and heart disease, prevent your bones from becoming brittle, fuel you through your kickboxing class, and give you the energy to keep reading this book (not that this book isn’t a real page turner, of course).\\n\\nSo what’s the right way to eat? Americans seem to be obsessed with finding the answer. The bestseller lists are always filled with diet books, whether it’s The South Beach Diet, The Abs Diet, Superfoods, or Dr. Atkins’ New Diet Revolution, and many contain specific rules about how to eat.\\n\\nWe say: Forget about all these rules and gimmicks. No single eating plan works for everyone. How much, how often, and what time of day you should eat depends on so many factors, including your body size, how much you exercise, your daily schedule, and your personal preferences. What appears to work for Dr. Atkins may not work for you — and may not be nutritionally sound, anyway. Plus, figuring out what to eat shouldn’t be so complicated!\\n\\n86 Part II: Enjoying Total-Body Health: Eating Well and Staying Injury-Free\\n\\nYou shouldn’t have to carry around a diet book and constantly glance at your watch. A better plan is to know nutrition basics, listen to your body’s own signals for hunger and food preferences, and develop eating habits that you can sustain for life — not just for five days.\\n\\nIn this chapter, we present sensible, basic guidelines for nutritious eating. Adopting these common-sense rules will help you maintain your weight and your health yet, at the same time, keep your taste buds interested. If you’re interested in a more in-depth discussion of nutrition, visit www.dummies.com for a wealth of health and nutrition books that answer your every question.\\n\\nControl Your Calories\\n\\nAs a country, we eat less fat than we used to, but we’re more overweight than ever. How come? Because people don’t pay enough attention to calories. The reality is, if you eat more calories than your body consumes, you’re going to gain weight. If your nutrition analysis — or simply the fit of your jeans — indicates that you’re eating too much, use the strategies in this section to keep your calories under control. Just make sure you don’t drop your calorie intake too low, especially if you exercise regularly. If you drastically cut calories — particularly if you drop below 1,200 — your body will think it’s being starved and will compensate by hanging on to the few calories that you do eat.\\n\\n(cid:2) Start with small portions. You don’t need to model your dinner plate\\n\\nafter the Eiffel Tower. You can always go back for more. Also, buy single- serving packages of snack foods. You’re less likely to keep eating if you have to rip open a whole new bag of chips than if you have your hand buried in a bargain-sized package.\\n\\n(cid:2) Don’t confuse fat-free with calorie-free. Many fat-free foods are plenty high in calories because they make up for the lost fat by adding sugar. One Reduced-Fat Chips Ahoy! cookie has 50 calories, while a regular Chips Ahoy! has 53. Not exactly major savings.\\n\\n(cid:2) Don’t deprive yourself. If you lust after a slice of chocolate cake, eat a small piece; otherwise you’ll end up inhaling an entire cake tomorrow. (cid:2) Eat slowly. Utter at least one complete sentence between bites or chew 32 times before taking another spoonful. Many people eat so fast that they don’t taste anything and then rush back for seconds. Give your body a chance to feel full.\\n\\n(cid:2) Go easy on the booze. Alcohol stimulates your appetite and weakens your reserve. This combination can lead to some serious overeating. Instead of drinking before a meal, drink while you eat.\\n\\nChapter 7: Nutrition Basics\\n\\n87\\n\\n(cid:2) Stop when you’re satisfied. Eat half of what’s on your plate and then take a ten-minute break and assess whether you’re still hungry. People often eat for reasons other than hunger, such as depression and exhaustion. Make sure that you’re eating for the right reasons.\\n\\n(cid:2) Eat regular meals. Skipping meals sets you up for losing control and\\n\\novereating. You’re less likely to pig out if you avoid becoming a ravenous monster in the first place.\\n\\nGet the Skinny on Fat\\n\\nFor years we’ve heard a single message about fat: It’s bad for you. There’s just one problem with this message: It’s not true. In reality, only certain types of fat are harmful to your health. Others may actually help prevent heart dis- ease. And we all need some fat to absorb certain vitamins and maintain a healthy immune system; fat also provides the material for hormone produc- tion, such as testosterone.\\n\\nDistinguish between healthful and unhealthful fats\\n\\nIn the following sections, we take a look at the different types of fat.\\n\\nSaturated fat Saturated fat is the really bad stuff. In excess quantities, saturated fat raises your levels of blood cholesterol and clogs your arteries. It’s found mostly in animal products, such as beef, pork, chicken, milk, ice cream, and cheese. But the amount of saturated fat in these foods varies greatly. For instance, 4 ounces of roasted pork tenderloin contain only about 2 grams of saturated fat, compared to 12 grams of saturated fat in 4 ounces of beef ribs.\\n\\nHow much saturated fat is too much? The major health organizations recom- mend keeping saturated fat to less than 10 percent of your total calories. If you eat 2,000 calories per day, that means you can get 200 of those calories from saturated fat. Because 1 gram of saturated fat (or fat of any kind) contains 9 calories, you can eat about 22 grams of saturated fat per day. (By the way, that’s four fewer saturated fat grams than the amount in one Burger King Double Whopper with cheese.)\\n\\n88 Part II: Enjoying Total-Body Health: Eating Well and Staying Injury-Free\\n\\nTrans fats These artery-clogging fats may be just as harmful as saturated fats; they’re created through hydrogenation, a process that turns liquid oils into solids like margarine and shortening. Hydrogenation makes pie crusts flakier and french fries crispier. (Thanks to their trans fat, McDonald’s french fries have roughly as much artery-clogging fat as if they were fried in lard.)\\n\\nChips, crackers, cookies (yes, even low-fat cookies), granola bars, pastries, microwave popcorn, many types of bread, many cereals, and many peanut butters often contain trans fats. Look for the words hydrogenated or partially hydrogenated on labels and avoid those products that use hydrogenated oils, especially when near the top of the list. Keep reading labels and don’t give up: For every ten cereals or microwave popcorn products that have trans fat, you can find one that doesn’t.\\n\\nUnsaturated fat All right, now we’re getting to the fats that may actually be good for your health. Unsaturated fat is the kind found in foods such as:\\n\\n(cid:2) Avocados (cid:2) Canola and flaxseed oils (cid:2) Fatty fish, such as salmon and mackerel (cid:2) Nuts and seeds (cid:2) Peanuts and “natural” peanut butter (the kind made only from peanuts and salt, as opposed to the processed kinds, like Jif and Skippy, which have hydrogenated fats, mentioned in the preceding section)\\n\\n(cid:2) Olives and olive oil\\n\\nUnsaturated fats fall into two categories: mono and poly. Olive and canola oils are predominantly monounsaturated, as are peanut butter and avocado. Corn, soybean, safflower, and sunflower oils are mainly polyunsaturated.\\n\\nThe evidence is strong that monounsaturated fats may help protect against heart disease by reducing levels of LDL cholesterol (the artery-clogging kind) without affecting HDL cholesterol (the kind that acts as a vacuum cleaner within your bloodstream). There’s less of a consensus about polyunsaturated fats, but you want to eat a balance of both.\\n\\nSo how much fat is it okay to eat?\\n\\nThat’s debatable. Most major health organizations recommend keeping your total fat intake to less than 30 percent of your total calories (about 66 fat grams per day if you eat 2,000 calories). However, the 30 percent figure is not backed\\n\\nChapter 7: Nutrition Basics\\n\\n89\\n\\nby solid evidence. Certain Greek populations of the 1960s ate as much as 40 percent fat — primarily from olive oil — and their heart disease rates were a remarkable 90 percent lower than those of Americans. There may be a range of acceptable fat intake levels. Keeping your saturated fat to less than 10 percent of total calories appears to be the more important figure.\\n\\nChoose Your Carbs Carefully\\n\\nRead some of the most popular low-carb diet books and you get the impres- sion that carbohydrates are the root of all evil. Many of these books claim that pasta, bagels, fruit, sweet potatoes, and other high-carbohydrate foods trigger the body to store excess fat. But, as with many wacky diet theories, this one takes a scientific theory and distorts it beyond recognition.\\n\\nIn reality, carbohydrates are your body’s main source of fuel, and exercisers need plenty of them. Sports nutritionists recommend that between 50 percent and 70 percent of calories should come from carbohydrates.\\n\\nChoosing the best carbs\\n\\nThe key is to favor complex carbohydrates and natural simple sugars over processed and nutritionally-void simple sugars. Complex carbohydrates have sugar molecules strung together in long chemically bonded chains. These carbs are found in beans, whole-wheat pasta, grains, veggies, and the like. Most complex carbs are low in calories, low in fat, and high in fiber. The sugar in complex carbohydrates is absorbed relatively slowly into your bloodstream so that your blood-sugar level and energy level remain fairly constant, and you feel full for a good while.\\n\\nGetting enough fiber\\n\\nAlthough most Americans eat just 12 to 17 grams of fiber per day, the federal government recommends 20 to 35 — nearly double. Fiber comes from whole- grain products (veggies, fruits, oats, whole-wheat bread), plus in dry beans, peas, nuts, and seed. Check labels, of course, and you’ll find very little fiber in processed foods. To get the most fiber, eat whole-grain flour-based prod- ucts and the skin on vegetables and fruits.\\n\\nPerhaps the most well-known benefit of fiber is to keep your colon healthy and keep your bowel movements regular. Fiber also plays a role in reducing cholesterol. But the most tangible benefit? Fiber keeps you feeling full longer throughout the day.\\n\\n90 Part II: Enjoying Total-Body Health: Eating Well and Staying Injury-Free\\n\\nIf you just don’t eat a lot of fiber in your diet and can’t seem to change that pat- tern, try using a fiber supplement such as Metamucil. Although you want to get your fiber from the foods you eat, a supplement is a good idea if you don’t.\\n\\nAvoiding processed carbs\\n\\nSimple carbohydrates, on the other hand, are single or double sugar mole- cules. They’re found in table sugar and processed foods like Pepsi and Twinkies, but they also occur naturally, like in fruit. Simple carbs, whether they’re found in a papaya or a Pop Tart, are absorbed quickly, causing the amount of sugar in your blood to skyrocket and then plunge soon after, leav- ing you feeling tired and hungry. But there’s a difference between the natural simple sugars found in fruit and the refined simple sugars found in candy. When you eat that papaya, the sugar comes packaged with vitamins, minerals, water, and fiber. Also, the sweetness in fruit comes from fructose (as opposed to sucrose or glucose in other simple sugars), and fructose doesn’t cause the sort of sharp insulin spike that other simple sugars do.\\n\\nIn general, eat foods that are processed as little as possible. Choose an apple over apple juice, and whole-wheat bread over white bread. Be sure to buy bread that is actually labeled “whole wheat.” Many wheat and grain breads are mostly refined white bread colored with molasses, despite the brown wrapping that depicts wheat fields waving in the wind and names like “12- grain health nut bread.”\\n\\nRead food labels carefully and find out where you’re getting most of your refined sugar. Breakfast cereals such as Kellogg’s Raisin Bran and Frosted Flakes are more than 42 percent sugar. Flavored yogurts are loaded with sugar, too. Be aware that sugar goes by other aliases, including corn syrup, honey, maple syrup, maltodextrin, sucrose, and other words that end in -ose. Sugar is sugar.\\n\\nGoing low-carb — with modifications\\n\\nIf you’ve been bitten by the low-carb craze, don’t fret. Low-carb eating could be an ideal way to eat with the following simple modifications:\\n\\n(cid:2) Consume an unlimited variety of vegetables. (cid:2) Choose dense, whole grains and avoid processed carbs. (cid:2) Eat two to four half-cup servings of unsweetened fruit each day. (Most\\n\\nlow-carb diets eliminate fruit, but fruit contains many vitamins and min- erals that are important to consume.)\\n\\n(cid:2) Substantially reduce your intake of saturated fat and trans fats, which\\n\\nmany popular low-carb diets don’t limit.\\n\\nChapter 7: Nutrition Basics\\n\\n91\\n\\nEating a wide variety of foods\\n\\nEver notice that you stroll down the same aisles of the grocery store every week and fill your basket with almost the exact same items? People who have researched these things have found that most of us are in a serious rut, eating only 20 to 25 different foods on a regular basis. Not only does this repetition take a lot of the adventure out of eating, but eating the same foods over and over again limits the nutrients you get.\\n\\nEven if you consume adequate amounts of vita- mins and minerals, you may be missing out on thousands of phytochemicals, substances in fruits and vegetables that appear to help fight heart disease and cancer, strengthen the\\n\\nimmune system, and slow the aging process. These substances have catchy names like quercetin, genistein, ferulic acid, and inositol hexaphosphate. Research into phytochemicals is relatively new, so nutrition experts don’t yet know how much of them we need or which ones are most important. The best strategy is to eat as wide a variety of foods as possible. If you’re a big fan of broccoli and eat it several times a week, the next time you’re in the gro- cery store, instead of choosing only broc- coli (high in organosulfides, flavonoids, and indoles — to name a few), go for asparagus, too (high in lutein, zeaxanthin, and glutathione).\\n\\nGet Enough Protein, but Don’t Fall for High-Protein Propaganda\\n\\nProtein is crucial because it’s made up of amino acids, which your body uses to build and repair your muscles, red blood cells, enzymes, and other tissues. Are you a protein overeater or undereater? Or are you right on target? The general rule of thumb for inactive people is to eat 0.4 grams per 1 pound of body weight. For example, a 180-pound couch potato multiplies 180 by 0.4. He needs about 72 grams of protein a day; a 130-pound person needs about 52.\\n\\nExercisers need a bit more protein, although not nearly as much as many protein advertisements would lead you to believe. A recreational exerciser should aim for 0.5 to 0.75 grams of protein per pound of body weight. A com- petitive athlete may need as much as 0.9.\\n\\nTo get an idea of how easy it is to rack up protein, consider that a Philly Cheese steak (36 grams), a side of fries (6 grams), and an 8-ounce glass of chocolate milk (8 grams) provide 50 grams of protein. In general, about 15 to 20 percent of your total calories should come from protein.\\n\\nYou can assess your protein needs by following the tips in the “Analyze Your Eating Habits” section later in this chapter. If you find that you’re overshoot- ing the mark on protein, cut back by using high-protein foods as a side-dish\\n\\n92 Part II: Enjoying Total-Body Health: Eating Well and Staying Injury-Free\\n\\nrather than as your main course. Sprinkle meat on your spaghetti or top your salad with strips of grilled chicken rather than planning your entire meal around a slab of steak. If you find that you’re not getting enough protein because you fear the fat, focus on the plant sources, such as dried peas and beans, lentils, soybeans, and black beans. Also, turn to dairy foods like fat- free cottage cheese and fat-free plain yogurt. If you’re a vegetarian, even a vegan, you have plenty of protein-rich choices.\\n\\nAnalyze Your Eating Habits\\n\\nDo you have any idea whether you’re even in the ballpark for how much saturated fat, protein, and other nutrients you need each day? Do you know whether you’re consuming enough fiber or calcium or carbohydrates? One of the best ways to enlighten yourself about your diet is to track it for a while. Now, we’re not suggesting that you write down every morsel you eat on a daily basis for the rest of your life. But we do recommend that you keep a food and beverage diary for a few days every now and then to get a handle on where your eating habits need improvement.\\n\\nThe simplest, low-tech way is to buy books that list how many calories and how much fat, saturated fat, protein, fiber, and other nutrients are contained in pretty much every food or drink you can think of, from Brussels sprouts to Japanese fish paste cake — whatever that is. (You can also find several online sources, but their locations change frequently. Search on “calorie counter” and see what pops up.)\\n\\nIf you want to compare the number of calories you’re eating with the number of calories your body burns each day, you can use the following formula. In general, the number of calories you need to eat each day depends on how big your body is and how active you are.\\n\\nWe carry through the math for a man who’s 5\\'10\" and weights 180 pounds and is trying to maintain his current weight, not lose anything:\\n\\n1. Change your weight to kilograms by dividing your weight in pounds\\n\\nby 2.2.\\n\\nFor our sample man, we divide 180 by 2.2 and get 82.\\n\\n2. If you’re a man, don’t do anything. If you’re a woman, multiply the\\n\\nresult of Step 1 by 0.9.\\n\\n3. Multiply the result of Step 2 by 24.\\n\\nThis calculation estimates your resting metabolic rate, the number of calories you’d need to consume if you did absolutely nothing but lie motionless in bed 24 hours a day.\\n\\nFor our sample man, we multiply 82 by 24 and get 1,968.\\n\\nChapter 7: Nutrition Basics\\n\\n93\\n\\n4. Add a percentage of Step 3 to account for your activity.\\n\\nFor a relatively sedentary day — say, a day lying around the pool — tack on 20 percent of your Step 3 result. For our sample man at the pool, we perform this calculation: 1,968 × 0.20 = 394; 394 + 1,968 = 2,362 calories.\\n\\nOn days when you exercise, you may need to add 30 to 50 percent of your resting metabolic rate, depending on how long and how hard you work out.\\n\\nYou may also want to make an appointment with a registered dietitian every so often. A visit with an R.D. can be very enlightening. He can not only tell you where you’re falling short but also offer concrete suggestions on how to boost your iron intake, reduce your calorie consumption, or sneak more fiber into your diet.\\n\\nFollow a Food Pyramid\\n\\nBack in the days of Wonder Bread and Bosco, you and your fellow fourth- graders probably were treated to an educational film about the basic four food groups: meat, dairy, fruits and vegetables, and cereals and grains (in case you forgot). The idea was that if you got enough servings from each group, you’d cover all your nutritional bases.\\n\\nIn 1992, the federal government exiled the four food groups and unveiled the food guide pyramid (see the following section). Nutrition experts applauded the basic concept — that plant foods should form the base of our diet while animal products, perched near the top of the pyramid, should be eaten less often. But to many nutritionists, the pyramid does not reflect the latest nutri- tion research and may, inadvertently, promote a diet linked to heart disease and cancer. In the last several years, experts have erected more than a dozen competing nutritional structures, including various vegetarian pyramids, a Latin American pyramid, an Indian pyramid, and several Asian pyramids. There’s even a vegan trapezoid. (A geometry refresher course, anyone?)\\n\\nWe’re not going to analyze each and every pyramid in existence, but here’s a brief look at the government’s pyramid, the Mediterranean Diet Pyramid, and a newer pyramid from Harvard University. You can take the best of these structures and create a model of nutritious eating that works for you.\\n\\nThe USDA Food Guide Pyramid\\n\\nDoes three glasses of whole milk and a half-pound of hamburger per day sound like a healthy eating plan? Of course not. But that scenario is technically permitted under the USDA Food Guide Pyramid (shown in Figure 7-1), and it\\n\\n94 Part II: Enjoying Total-Body Health: Eating Well and Staying Injury-Free\\n\\nillustrates one of the pyramid’s main flaws: failure to distinguish healthful fats from disease-causing fats. The pyramid lumps together meat, poultry, fish, dry beans, eggs, and nuts, and recommends two to three daily servings from this group of protein-rich foods. (One meat serving is 3 ounces, thereby allowing for the 8-ounce burger.) But these foods aren’t equally healthful. Some cuts of red meat are loaded with saturated fat, while nuts, which contain vitamin E and heart-healthy (monounsaturated) fat, are very nutritious.\\n\\nAs for that whole milk: The pyramid recommends two to three daily servings of milk, yogurt, or cheese but doesn’t specifically recommend low-fat or nonfat versions of these high-calcium foods. (Full-fat varieties are loaded with saturated fat.) At the same time, the pyramid groups fats, oils, and sweets at the top of the pyramid, with the admonition to “use sparingly.” Yet research clearly shows that the fats found in olive oil and canola oil may protect against disease.\\n\\nOne benefit of the USDA Food Guide Pyramid is that it specifies a range of daily servings for each food category. Still, the numbers can be confusing. The pyramid recommends two to four fruit servings a day, but this is intended as a minimum. On the other hand, two to three servings from the protein-rich group is intended as a maximum.\\n\\nFigure 7-1: The USDA Food Guide Pyramid.\\n\\nChapter 7: Nutrition Basics\\n\\n95\\n\\nA final gripe: The base of the pyramid — which includes bread, cereal, rice, and pasta — fails to distinguish between whole grains (thought to decrease risk of heart disease, diabetes, and some cancers) and refined grains (which are essentially stripped of vitamins, minerals, and fiber). For this reason, the federal government is now putting together panels to update its pyramid. As we went to print, the new pyramid wasn’t ready, but check the Internet to see whether the USDA has made the radical revisions to the food pyramid that they’ve proposed.\\n\\nThe Mediterranean Diet Pyramid\\n\\nMany of the USDA pyramid’s problems are addressed by the Mediterranean Diet Pyramid (shown in Figure 7-2). Although refined in light of current nutri- tion research, the Mediterranean diet pyramid essentially reflects the eating habits of certain Greek and Italian populations around 1960, when their chronic disease rates were among the world’s lowest and adult life expectancy was the highest despite limited medical services.\\n\\nMediterranean Diet Pyramid\\n\\nDaily beverage recommendations: 6 glasses of water\\n\\nMeat\\n\\nMonthly\\n\\nSweets\\n\\nEggs\\n\\nWeekly\\n\\nPoultry\\n\\nFish\\n\\nWine in moderation\\n\\nCheese and yogurt\\n\\nOlive oil\\n\\nFruits\\n\\nBeans, legumes, and nuts\\n\\nVegetables\\n\\nDaily\\n\\nFigure 7-2: The Mediterra- nean Diet Pyramid.\\n\\nBread, pasta, rice, couscous, polenta, other whole grains, and potatoes\\n\\nDaily physical activity\\n\\n96 Part II: Enjoying Total-Body Health: Eating Well and Staying Injury-Free\\n\\nThe Mediterranean Diet Pyramid prioritizes the high-protein foods that are lumped together in the USDA model. Beans and nuts sit near the base of the pyramid, recommended daily. Fish, poultry, and eggs are permitted a few times per week, but fish is given more emphasis than poultry, which is favored over eggs. That’s because fish, high in omega-3 fatty acids, may protect against heart disease, whereas the skinless white meat of poultry appears to be neu- tral, neither increasing nor decreasing disease risk. Eggs may raise cholesterol levels but don’t appear to be a problem (for non-diabetics) if no more than seven eggs are consumed per week. Red meat is relegated to the tip-top of the pyramid, recommended only a few times per month. (Although red meat consumption is clearly linked to deadly disease, there’s no evidence that eating 12 to 16 ounces a month is actually more harmful than eating none at all.)\\n\\nThe Mediterranean Diet Pyramid also scores points for highlighting legumes, a term that doesn’t roll off the tongue of most Americans. Legumes — basically edible seed pods — include chick peas, lentils, garbanzo beans, and soybeans. They’re not only high in protein but also free of saturated fat and crammed with disease-protective nutrients.\\n\\nIs the Mediterranean Diet Pyramid perfect? No. Like the USDA version, it doesn’t distinguish between whole grains and refined grains.\\n\\nHarvard School of Public Health’s Healthy Eating Pyramid\\n\\nWhen the folks at Harvard’s School of Public Health decided to build their own food pyramid (shown in Figure 7-3), they came up with one that addressed the deficiencies of the USDA and Mediterranean Diet models.\\n\\nSpecifically, the Harvard model specifies whole grains at the base of the pyra- mid, with plant oils sharing the stage. Plant oils? Sure. Healthy, unsaturated oils like olive, canola, soy, and so on can lower cholesterol levels and protect the heart. The Harvard pyramid then stresses vegetables in whatever quantity is desired and some fruits. Going up the pyramid, you find a recommendation for nuts, fish, poultry, and eggs, but in moderation. Also recommended is a daily supplement, one specifically providing calcium. The top of the pyramid includes refined grains, sweets, red meat, and butter.\\n\\nThis pyramid does address many of the weaknesses of the other two pyramids. Its deficiency is in calcium intake, which is relegated to a supplement. Low-fat and nonfat dairy products, especially those low in sugar, are a good source of calcium. Supplements are a potential substitute for food sources (see the “Don’t Waste Money on Useless Supplements” section for details), but getting your vitamins and minerals from food is always a better goal than relying on supplements.\\n\\nChapter 7: Nutrition Basics\\n\\n97\\n\\nHealthy Eating Pyramid\\n\\nUse sparingly\\n\\nRed meat, butter\\n\\nWhite rice, white bread, potatoes and pasta, sweets\\n\\nMultiple vitamins for most\\n\\nDairy or calcium supplement, 1-2 times/day\\n\\nFish, poultry, eggs, 0-2 times/day\\n\\nAlcohol in moderation (unless contraindicated)\\n\\nNuts, legumes, 1-3 times/day\\n\\nVegetables (in abundance)\\n\\nFruits, 2-3 times/day\\n\\nFigure 7-3: The Healthy Eating Pyramid.\\n\\nWhole grain foods (at most meals)\\n\\nPlant oils, including olive, canola, soy, corn, sunflower, peanut, and other vegetable oils\\n\\nDaily exercise and weight control\\n\\nFuel Up for Your Workouts\\n\\nDon’t underestimate the power of food to get you through a workout and beyond. This goes for novices and athletes alike. Several years ago, profes- sional triathlete Brad Kearns went on a wacky diet that had one rule: Eat nothing but fruit until noon. “I’d have a melon, a banana, and some berries, then I’d go ride my bike for three hours and swim for an hour and a half,” Brad told us. Three months later, he hadn’t lost any weight and was strug- gling to finish his races. “I was so starved that I was eating peanut butter straight from the jar,” he recalls. “It made me realize that your body doesn’t like your messing with it. You have to eat.” You also need to drink — before, during, and after your workout. (See the “Drink Lots and Lots of Fluids” sec- tion later in this chapter for more about staying hydrated.) Here are some strategies for maintaining the energy to perform your best.\\n\\nBefore you work out\\n\\nYour mom may have told you not to go swimming until at least an hour after you eat, but we tell you the opposite: If your stomach can handle it, eat within an hour of your workout. (For some activities, such as running, you\\n\\n98 Part II: Enjoying Total-Body Health: Eating Well and Staying Injury-Free\\n\\nmay need two or three hours between eating and working out.) We recommend a couple hundred calories of (primarily) complex carbohydrates, such as a bagel or a couple pieces of fruit. A little protein may help if you’re going for a long workout lasting a few hours or more.\\n\\nDuring your workout\\n\\nDuring most workouts, you don’t need to eat anything unless you feel a major dip in energy. But if you’re going for a three-hour bike ride or an afternoon hike, bring along snacks. Energy bars like PowerBars and Clif Bars or frosting- like gels such as GU or Power Gel are convenient choices. They easily slip into your pocket or fanny pack and don’t get smashed like Fig Newtons or bananas.\\n\\nFor workouts that last longer than about an hour, sports drinks such as Gatorade and Cytomax are a good idea. They provide fluid as well as sodium and easily-digestible energy. Water is preferred for shorter workouts.\\n\\nAfter your workout\\n\\nSome people are under the impression that if they eat right after exercise, they somehow negate the benefits of their hard work. Just the opposite is true. If you eat within an hour of your workout, your body is more receptive to replenishing your energy stores. A post-workout snack that combines lots of carbs and some protein is ideal.\\n\\nDon’t go too long without eating\\n\\nAt one of the gyms that Liz used to manage, the staff members witness at least one fainting a month. Usually it’s someone who shows up for a lunchtime workout without having eaten anything since an English muffin at 6 a.m. To maintain a consistent energy level throughout the day — and to prevent fainting episodes — make an effort to eat small, frequent meals.\\n\\nEven on days when you don’t exercise, eating frequently throughout the day is important. Waiting long periods between meals can cause wide swings in your blood sugar levels, which in turn can zap your energy, disturb your con- centration, and turn you into a crankpot. Plus, if you let yourself become rav- enous, you’re likely to overeat at your next meal, a pattern that can lead to weight gain.\\n\\nChapter 7: Nutrition Basics\\n\\n99\\n\\nSo, start your engines in the morning with a good breakfast — plenty of complex carbohydrates with an accent of protein and a dash of fat. A good example: hot oatmeal with skim milk, half a banana, walnuts, and a glass of orange juice. Then graze through the day, eating up to six small meals, aiming for a mix of carbs and protein each time — the combination will keep you satisfied longer than carbs alone. Eating breakfast can boost your metabolism 25 percent for the day!\\n\\nDrink Lots and Lots of Fluids\\n\\nStaying hydrated isn’t just important for when you work out. More than 75 percent of your body is made up of water — even bone is more than 20 per- cent water. When you don’t drink enough water, your blood doesn’t flow properly, and your digestive track doesn’t run smoothly. New research even suggests that drinking plenty of water can reduce the risk of breast, colon, and urinary tract cancers.\\n\\nYou’ve probably heard that you need to drink 8 glasses of water a day — 9 to 13 if you exercise. Here’s where that number comes from: You typically lose about 10 cups of water per day — 2 cups to sweating and evaporation, 2 cups to breathing, and 6 cups to waste removal. You can replace up to 2 cups through the water in the foods you eat, but you have to make up the remain- ing 8 cups by drinking fluids, water being the best choice.\\n\\nRecent research suggests that you need a much higher fluid intake, from 3 to 6 quarts per day (and because there are 4 cups in a quart, that’s 12 to 24 cups per day). The low end is if you’re eating lots of fruits and vegetables (and you are, aren’t you?), because those foods are high in fluids. The high end is if you’re working out for many hours per day, in hot weather (which we, inci- dentally, don’t recommend). Your fluid intake can come from many sources, as outlined in the following list:\\n\\n(cid:2) Water: Good old-fashioned water is far and away the best way to get your fluids. Water is critical for proper functioning of your organs, so you want to get the majority of your fluids by drinking water. Keep a water bottle with you at all times: on your desk, in your purse, and in your car.\\n\\nIf you don’t like the taste of water, you may have substances in your water that create an off-taste. Note, however, that most bottled water is just a bottled version of whatever’s in your tap, so you need to decide whether it’s worth the extra expense. You can try filtering your water: Brita and other companies make low-cost filter systems that attach to your kitchen or bathroom faucet. If you’re still not thrilled with the taste of water, trying squeezing a slice of lemon into each glass.\\n\\n100 Part II: Enjoying Total-Body Health: Eating Well and Staying Injury-Free\\n\\n(cid:2) Sports beverages: Sports beverages include Gatorade, Powerade,\\n\\nAccelerade, and so on, and if you’ve never tried them, they’re actually quite palatable — most taste just like Kool-Aid. The advantage of a sports beverage over water is that it includes electrolytes like potassium, magnesium, calcium, and sodium that you lose as you sweat. Sports bev- erages can also keep you from getting a stomachache after exercising.\\n\\nThe disadvantage is that sports beverages are pretty high in calories, and if you get in the habit of thinking of sports beverages like water, you can easily gain weight. If you really feel you need to include a sports bev- erage after workouts, try to limit your daily intake of sports beverages to 12 ounces, just after you finish exercising.\\n\\nSports drinks are expensive if you buy them in individual bottles. To save money, buy the powdered version at your local grocery store. You simply mix the powder with water, and you pay less than one-tenth the price with the exact same flavor. You can dilute sports beverages in extra water to reduce calories and sugar content.\\n\\n(cid:2) Carbonated sodas and carbonated sports drinks: Carbonated beverages, including sugary sodas, add calories to your diet without adding any vitamins or other nutrients, and they don’t contain the electrolytes that sports beverages offer. One alternative is the new variety of carbonated flavored water. However, all carbonated beverages, even carbonated water, also contain phosphates, which can interfere with calcium absorp- tion and may lead to bone-density problems. A treat now and then isn’t going to hurt you, though.\\n\\n(cid:2) Juice: One-hundred-percent orange juice is rich in potassium, vitamin C, and other important vitamins. However, it’s high in calories and doesn’t really fill you up, so go easy on it. One small glass per day (6 to 8 ounces) is about all you need. You get a better bang for the buck by eating the whole fruit, so if you’re choosing between the fruit and the juice, go with the fruit — it’s more filling than juice and provides additional nutrients. (cid:2) Low-fat or nonfat milk: Two or three 8- to 12-ounce glasses of low-fat or fat-free milk are an excellent source of calcium, but you may not be able to stomach a glass of milk right after working out. If not, try drinking a glass of skim milk just before bed (warm it up in the microwave, if you like). In addition to helping you get much-needed calcium, milk has pro- tein, which may help you fall asleep quickly.\\n\\n(cid:2) Coffee and tea: Coffee and tea are hot, tasty beverages, but a better\\n\\nchoice is water. However, coffee and tea are fluids that count in your daily total of 8 cups, and if you look forward to your mug(s) of coffee or tea everyday, you don’t need to stop drinking it completely. Just limit the total number of mugs, because caffeine can have a dehydrating effect, negating some of the benefits of drinking the fluids in the first place.\\n\\nChapter 7: Nutrition Basics\\n\\n101\\n\\nDon’t rely on thirst to tell you when to drink. By the time your mouth feels parched, you’re already mildly dehydrated. Prevent dehydration by drinking all day long. Keep a water bottle at your desk, and always carry a bottle when you work out. See Chapter 26 for some innovative products that make drink- ing water more convenient. You know that you’re not drinking enough if your urine is dark and scanty rather than clear and plentiful. Keep in mind that vitamin supplements can make your urine dark or fluorescent yellow; in this case, volume is a better indicator.\\n\\nDon’t Waste Money on Useless Supplements\\n\\nSupplements are promoted everywhere these days — on infomercials, in health-food stores, and at health clubs. Whether they claim to build muscle, burn fat, or boost your metabolism, the vast majority of supplements — including pyruvate and chitin — aren’t worth the cost of the plastic bottles they come in. That’s why we include them in our list of fitness rip-offs in Chapter 27.\\n\\nAre any supplements worth taking? Actually, yes. A multivitamin/mineral supplement isn’t a necessity, but for many people, it may be a good idea. According to the United States Department of Agriculture, about 90 percent of us fail to get enough magnesium, chromium, vitamin A, B vitamins, vitamin E, zinc, and many other nutrients. The typical woman gets less than two-thirds the calcium she needs to help prevent osteoporosis. In a typical four-day period, nearly half of all women fail to eat a single piece of fresh fruit, and the vast majority fail to eat even one dark green leafy vegetable. This explains why women are so deficient in vitamin C, folic acid, and other vital nutrients.\\n\\nThe second reason we recommend supplements is that even if you make all the right food choices, getting optimal amounts of a few particular vitamins and minerals is tough. For instance, research suggests that vitamin E may lower your risk of cancer and heart disease, but only when you consume at least 100 IU (international units, a way of measuring tiny amounts). To get this much vitamin E from your diet, you’d have to eat 25 cups of cooked spinach or drink 11⁄4 cups of vegetable oil (not recommended, by the way). Unlike with vitamin C, there’s no easy way to get vitamin E from food.\\n\\nHowever, none of this means that you should rely on supplements for your vitamins and minerals. Scientists are learning that the vitamins or minerals alone may not prevent certain diseases; instead the benefit may come from the way these nutrients mingle with other components in food. Aim to get the\\n\\n102 Part II: Enjoying Total-Body Health: Eating Well and Staying Injury-Free\\n\\nvast majority of your vitamins and minerals from food and take the word sup- plement literally. No pill will compensate for a diet of Doritos and Budweiser. When you eat healthy foods, you not only get vitamins and minerals, but you also get protein, carbohydrates, fiber, and other nutrients.\\n\\nChoose a multivitamin (rather than individual pills) with doses that don’t go much beyond 100 percent of the U.S. RDA (Recommended Dietary Allowance). Don’t bother with super potency megavitamins, which often contain more than ten times the U.S. RDA (and cost you bundles). Your body can absorb only so much of each nutrient; if you go overboard, most of the excess is just excreted when you go to the bathroom. As one doctor told us, “You’ll have very expensive urine.” Also, some vitamins are stored in your body, so mega- doses can lead to dangerous outcomes.\\n\\nAlso, forget those designer vitamins hawked infomercial-style by has-been celebrities and former athletes. Generic drugstore brands are identical. Manufacturers have yet to come up with the magical combination of dosages to banish wrinkles or to make you live to 196, although a telemarketer once called to inform Liz that every single Olympic athlete today swears by her particular brand of supplements. “Really, every single one?” she asked. Yes, she said. She was quite sure — every single one.\\n\\nPart III Getting to the Heart of the Matter\\n\\nWe explain what the heck aerobic and cardiovascular\\n\\nabout this type of exercise, also known as cardio exercise. In Chapter 8, we give you a crash course on cardio basics, explaining terms such as target heart rate and anaerobic threshold. We also help you design a cardio workout pro- gram suited to your goals and fitness level. In Chapter 9, we explain how to use indoor cardio equipment such as elliptical trainers, stair-climbers, treadmills, and other machines. Chapter 10 covers tips and equipment for pop- ular outdoor cardio activities — such as walking, running, in-line skating, cycling, and swimming — along with up- and-coming activities such as snowshoeing.\\n\\nmean and tell you everything you need to know\\n\\nIn this part . . .\\n\\nChapter 8 Cardio Crash Course\\n\\nIn This Chapter (cid:1) Warming up and cooling down (cid:1) Knowing how hard you need to push to achieve cardio benefits (cid:1) Following a cardio workout for good health (cid:1) Using a cardio program to help you lose weight (cid:1) Getting in your best cardio shape ever (cid:1) Deciding whether to take a day off\\n\\ncardio pretty often. Someone may say, “I prefer to do cardio after I lift weights” or “My gym has awesome cardio equipment.” Cardio — which means “for your heart” in medical jargon — is short for cardiovascular exercise, the kind that strengthens your heart and lungs and burns lots of calories.\\n\\nIf you hang around people who exercise, you’re going to hear the word\\n\\nIn Chapter 24, we list all kinds of reasons to pursue this sort of exercise — everything from lowering your blood pressure to sleeping more soundly to trimming that spare tire. This chapter explains how exactly to get those benefits — in other words, what type of exercise counts as cardio. We intro- duce you to terms such as aerobic, anaerobic, and target heart rate zone, which, in case you were wondering, has nothing to do with what happens to your heart when there’s a sale at Target. After you understand the basic concepts involved in cardio exercise, use the cardio plans near the end of this chapter to design a cardio workout program based on your goals.\\n\\nTwo Cardio Rules That You Can’t Break\\n\\nYou wouldn’t try to sell someone a stereo without a few pleasant introduc- tory words to your potential customer, right? You need to ease her into things with a couple of jokes or at least a “Good morning. How can I help you?” And certainly you wouldn’t turn your back on her the minute she\\n\\n106 Part III: Getting to the Heart of the Matter\\n\\nhanded over her credit card; you’d congratulate her on the purchase and wish her a nice day. Well, the same principles apply to exercise. No matter what type of cardio workout you do — whether it’s walking, playing basket- ball, or cross-country skiing — you need to ease into it with a warm-up and ease out of it with a cooldown. (Weight-training workouts also require a warm-up, as we explain in Chapter 14, although they typically don’t require a cardio cooldown.)\\n\\nWarming up\\n\\nA warm-up simply means 5 to 15 minutes of aerobic exercise at a very easy pace. For example, runners may start out with a brisk walk or a slow run. If you’re going on a hilly bike ride, start with at least a few miles on flat terrain. Be aware that stretching is not a good warm-up activity (see Chapter 6).\\n\\nWhat does aerobic mean, anyway?\\n\\nThe term cardio is often used interchangeably with aerobic. Aerobic exercise is any repetitive activity that you do long enough and hard enough to challenge your heart and lungs. To get this effect, you generally need to use your large muscles, including your butt, legs, back, and chest. Brisk walking, bicycling, swimming, and stair climbing count as aerobic exercise.\\n\\nMovements that use your smaller muscles, like those leading into your wrists and hands, don’t cut it. Channel surfing with your remote control can certainly be repetitive, sustained, and intense — particularly when performed by certain husbands and boyfriends we know — but it’s not aerobic.\\n\\nAerobic means with air, and cardio was coined in the late 1960s by fitness pioneer Dr. Kenneth Cooper, and it means heart. When you exercise aerobically, your body needs an extra supply of oxygen, which your lungs extract from the air. Think of oxygen as the gas in your car: When\\n\\nyou’re idling at a stoplight, you don’t need as much fuel as when you’re zooming across Montana on Interstate 90. During your aerobic workouts, your body continuously delivers oxygen to your muscles.\\n\\nHowever, if you push yourself hard enough, eventually you switch gears into using less oxygen: Your lungs can no longer suck in enough oxygen to keep up with your muscles’ demand for it. But you won’t collapse, at least right away. Instead, you begin to rely on your body’s limited capacity to keep going without oxygen. During this time, you’re exercising anaerobically, or without air.\\n\\nAnaerobic exercise refers to high-intensity exercise like all-out sprinting or very heavy weight lifting. After about 90 seconds, you begin gasping for air and you feel a burning sensation in your legs. That’s when your body forces you to stop.\\n\\nChapter 8: Cardio Crash Course\\n\\n107\\n\\nPeople who are out of shape need to warm up the longest. Their bodies take longer to get into the exercise groove because their muscles aren’t used to working hard. If you’re a beginner, any exercise is high-intensity exercise. As you get more fit, your body adapts and becomes more efficient, thereby warming up more quickly.\\n\\nMany people skip their warm-up because they’re in a hurry. Cranking up the LifeCycle or hitting the weight room right away seems like a more efficient use of time. Bad idea. Skimp on your warm-up, and you’re a lot more likely to injure yourself. Besides, when you ease into your workout, you enjoy it a lot more. A trainer we know says, “If you don’t have time to warm up, you don’t have time to work out!”\\n\\nWhat exactly does warming up do for you? Well, for one thing, a warm-up warms you up — literally. It increases the temperature in your muscles and in the tissues that connect muscle to bone (tendons) and bone to bone (liga- ments). Warmer muscles and joints are more pliable and, therefore, less likely to tear. Warming up also helps redirect your blood flow from places such as your stomach and spleen to the muscles that you’re using to exercise. This blood flow gives you more stamina by providing your muscles with more nutri- ents and oxygen. In other words, you tire more quickly if you don’t warm up.\\n\\nFinally, warming up allows your heart rate to increase at a safe, gradual pace. If you don’t warm up, your heart rate will shoot up too quickly, and you’ll feel like you’re walking through a knee-high snowdrift.\\n\\nCooling down\\n\\nAfter your workout, don’t stop suddenly and make a dash for the shower or plop on the couch. Ease out of your workout just as you eased into it, by walking, jogging, or cycling lightly. If you’ve been using a stair-climber at Level 5 for 20 minutes, you could cool down by dropping to Level 4 for a couple minutes, then to Level 3, and so on. This cooldown should last five to ten minutes — longer if you’ve done an especially hard workout.\\n\\nThe purpose of the cooldown is the reverse of the warm-up. At this point, your heart is jumping, and blood is pumping furiously through your muscles. You want your body to redirect the blood flow back to normal before you rush back to the office. You also want your body temperature to decrease before you hop into a hot or cold shower; otherwise, you risk fainting. Cooling down prevents your blood from pooling in one place, such as your legs. When you suddenly stop exercising, your blood can quickly collect, which can lead to dizziness, nausea, and fainting. If you’re really out of shape or at high risk for heart disease, skipping a cooldown can place undue stress on your heart.\\n\\n108 Part III: Getting to the Heart of the Matter\\n\\nHow Hard Do You Need to Push?\\n\\nTo reap the benefits of cardio exercise, how much huffing and puffing do you need to do? Not as much as you probably think. Sure, you won’t benefit much from walking on the treadmill at the same pace you stroll down the grocery store aisles; they don’t call it working out for nothing. On the other hand, exercising too hard can lead to injury and make you more susceptible to colds and infections; plus, you may get so burned out that you want to set fire to your stationary bike. Also, the faster you go, the less time you can keep up the exercise. Depending on what you’re trying to accomplish, you may gain just as much, if not more, from slowing things down and going farther.\\n\\nTo get fit and stay healthy, you need to find the middle ground: a moderate, or aerobic, pace. You can find this middle ground in a number of different ways. Some methods of gauging your intensity are extremely simple, and some require a foray into arithmetic. This section looks at three popular ways to monitor your intensity.\\n\\nThe talk test\\n\\nThe simplest way to monitor how hard you’re working is to talk. You should be able to carry on a conversation while you’re exercising. If you’re so out of breath that you can’t even string together the words “Help me, Mommy!” you need to slow down. On the other hand, if you’re able to belt out “Livin’ La Vida Loca” at the top of your lungs, that’s a pretty big clue you need to pick up the pace. Basically, you should feel like you’re working, but not so hard that you feel like your lungs are about to explode.\\n\\nPerceived exertion\\n\\nIf you’re the type of person who needs more precision in life than the talk test offers, you may like the so-called perceived exertion method of gauging inten- sity. This method uses a numerical scale, typically from 1 to 10, that corre- sponds to how hard you feel you’re working — the rate at which you perceive that you’re exerting yourself.\\n\\nAn activity rated 1 on a perceived exertion scale would be something that you feel you could do forever, like sit in bed and watch Chariots of Fire. A 10 repre- sents all-out effort, like the last few feet of an uphill sprint, about 20 seconds before your legs buckle. Your typical workout intensity should fall somewhere between 5 and 8. To decide on a number, pay attention to how hard you’re\\n\\nChapter 8: Cardio Crash Course\\n\\n109\\n\\nbreathing, how fast your heart is beating, how much you’re sweating, and how tired your legs feel — anything that contributes to the effort of sustaining the exercise.\\n\\nThe purpose of putting a numerical value on exercise is not to make your life more complicated but rather to help you maintain a proper workout intensity. For example, suppose you run 2 miles around your neighborhood, and it feels like an 8. If after a few weeks running those 2 miles feels like a 4, you know it’s time to pick up the pace. Initially, you may want to have a perceived exertion chart in front of you. Many gyms post these charts on the walls, and you can easily create one at home. After a few workouts you can use a mental chart. Table 8-1 shows a sample perceived exertion chart.\\n\\nTable 8-1\\n\\nPerceived Exertion Chart\\n\\nNumerical Rating\\n\\nSubjective Rating\\n\\nSample Activities\\n\\n0\\n\\nNothing at all\\n\\nSitting still, reading\\n\\n1\\n\\nVery light\\n\\nStanding in line\\n\\n2\\n\\nLight\\n\\nTaking a leisurely stroll\\n\\n3\\n\\n4\\n\\nLight/moderate\\n\\n5\\n\\nModerate\\n\\nWalking at a moderate pace, gardening\\n\\n6\\n\\n7\\n\\nHard\\n\\nJogging briskly, cycling over rolling hills\\n\\n8\\n\\nVery hard\\n\\nRunning\\n\\n9\\n\\n10\\n\\nExtremely hard\\n\\nSprinting up a steep hill\\n\\nMeasuring your heart rate\\n\\nThe talk test and the perceived exertion chart are both valid ways to make sure that you’re exercising at the right pace. But there’s a more precise way: measuring your heart rate, the number of times that your heart beats per\\n\\n110 Part III: Getting to the Heart of the Matter\\n\\nminute. (Your heart rate is also called your pulse.) You can determine this number either by counting the beats at your wrist or neck or by wearing a gadget called a heart-rate monitor. This section discusses both and also lets you know why you want to measure your heart rate and how you can deter- mine your own target heart-rate zone.\\n\\nWhy monitor your heart rate? Keeping track of your heart rate, by whatever method, sounds like an incredi- bly advanced thing to do — something way beyond a beginner’s needs. But even if you’re just starting out, heart-rate monitoring is abundantly effective.\\n\\nWhen you’re just starting to work out, you may not have a good sense of how hard to push yourself. And with all that “no pain, no gain” propaganda, you may be working harder than you really need to. Actually, this happens to advanced exercisers and athletes all the time. Left to their own devices, they try to outdo themselves every day. The smart ones use a heart-rate monitor to remind them to slow down. However, for most people, the problem is getting into a higher gear.\\n\\nKnowing how hard you’re working during a workout is far more helpful than simply knowing how fast you’re going. For example, running nine-minute miles on a hot, humid afternoon takes a lot more effort than running at the same pace on a cool, overcast morning. If you rely only on your stopwatch, you may push yourself to run nine-minute miles in the heat, when that pace may put excess stress on your body. If you pace yourself according to your heart rate instead, you know when you need to back off.\\n\\nThe same goes for when you’re tired. If you’ve had a particularly hard week at work, your body may not be up to your usual workout. Without checking your heart rate, you may force yourself to do Level 4 on the stair-climber, when, in fact, your body isn’t up to the task. If you monitor your pulse, you may find that, in order to keep up with Level 4, you have to exceed the high end of your training zone — a signal to drop down a notch or two.\\n\\nBy keeping track of your heart rate over a long period of time, you discover some interesting things about your progress. When you’re a beginner, your heart has to work a lot harder to keep up with your body’s demands for blood and oxygen. If you work out on a regular basis, your aerobic system gradually becomes more efficient. Suppose when you started, Level 1 on the exercise bike used to get your heart up to about 140 beats per minute; now, two months later, your heart rate is 125 beats per minute. This drop means that you need to step up the difficulty of your workout. You can see why keeping good records of your workouts is a good idea.\\n\\nTo find out how much your fitness level is improving, watch how fast your heart rate drops after a workout. Measure your heart rate immediately upon finishing your exercise session and then one minute later. The better shape\\n\\nChapter 8: Cardio Crash Course\\n\\n111\\n\\nyou’re in, the faster your heart rate drops. Ideally, your heart rate should plunge at least 20 beats in the first minute. People in really good shape drop 40 beats or more. Keep track of this measure. You’ll see a gradual improve- ment over a period of weeks and months. (Taking prescription or over-the- counter medication may affect the way your heart and blood pressure respond to exercise. Check with your doctor about this.)\\n\\nAs we mention in Chapter 2, monitoring your resting heart rate is also a good idea. Your resting heart rate is the number of times your heart beats per minute when you’re just sitting around. When you start exercising, your rest- ing heart rate may be as high as 90. But after a few months of exercising, your resting heart rate may drop 10 or 20 beats. Some top athletes in endurance sports have resting heart rates as low as 30 beats per minute. However, don’t compare your heart rate to anyone else’s. Your resting heart rate is partly determined by heredity.\\n\\nYour resting heart rate also can tell you a lot about your recovery from day to day. Keep your monitor by your bed and strap it on first thing in the morning, on a daily basis. Or, take your pulse manually. If your heart rate is ten beats higher than usual, you probably haven’t recovered from yesterday’s workout.\\n\\nYour target heart-rate zone Your heart rate can tell you so much about your body — how fit you are, how much you’ve improved, and whether you’ve recovered from yesterday’s workout. But how do you know what heart rate to aim for? There’s no magic number. Rather, there’s a whole range of acceptable numbers, commonly called your target heart-rate zone. This range is the middle ground between slacking off and knocking yourself out. Typically, your target zone (as it’s called for short) is between 50 percent and 85 percent of your maximum heart rate, the maximum number of times your heart should beat in a minute without dangerously overexerting yourself.\\n\\nThe point at which your body switches from using oxygen as its primary source of energy to using stored sugar is referred to as your anaerobic thresh- old. (You may also hear this referred to as the point at which lactic acid builds up.) When you’re in poor physical shape, your body isn’t very efficient at taking in oxygen, and you hit your anaerobic threshold while exercising at relatively low levels of exercise. As you become more fit, you’re able to go farther and faster, yet still supply oxygen to your muscles. If a couch potato tries to run an eight-minute-mile pace, he’s going to go anaerobic pretty darned fast. An elite runner can run an entire marathon at about a five-minute-mile pace and still stay primarily aerobic.\\n\\nAt the low end of your zone, you’re barely breaking a sweat; at the high end, you’re dripping like a Kentucky Derby winner. If you’re a beginner, stick to the lower end so you can move along comfortably for longer periods of time and\\n\\n112 Part III: Getting to the Heart of the Matter\\n\\nThe Karvonen method for target heart rate\\n\\nOne of the problems with the standard formula for finding your target heart rate is that it takes only your age into consideration. This is a valid consideration because your recommended maximum heart rate declines as you age. However, the following formula, called the Karvonen method, is somewhat more accurate because it also factors in your resting heart rate, the number of times your heart beats when you’re sitting still. Typically, as you become more fit, your heart rate drops.\\n\\n3. Multiply the number you arrived at in Step 2 by 50 percent. Then add your resting heart rate back in. 120 × 0.50 = 60\\n\\n60 + 60 = 120\\n\\n120 is the low end of the man’s target zone.\\n\\n4. Multiply the Step 2 result by 85 percent. Then add your resting heart rate back in. 120 × 0.85 = 102\\n\\nThe Karvonen method requires a bit more math, but don’t let that intimidate you. In this example, we use the case of a 40-year-old man who has a resting heart rate of 60 beats per minute and wants to work at between 50 percent and 85 percent of his maximum heart rate. Grab your calculator and follow these step-by-step instructions:\\n\\n1. Subtract your age from 220.\\n\\nUsing our example, 220 – 40 = 180.\\n\\nThis is our subject’s estimated maximum.\\n\\n102 + 60 = 162\\n\\n162 is the high end of the man’s target zone.\\n\\nOkay, now that you feel like you’ve earned your Ph.D. in calculus, you can compare the results of this formula with those of the traditional for- mula. Using the age-related formula, this 40- year-old’s target zone is 90 to 153 beats. But when you factor in his resting heart rate, this allows him to work up to 162 beats per minute. And he knows that if he drops below 102 beats, he probably needs to pick up the pace.\\n\\n2. Subtract your resting heart rate from your\\n\\nestimated maximum.\\n\\n180 – 60 = 120.\\n\\nwith less chance of injury. As you get more fit, you may want to do some of your training in the middle and upper end of your zone. In Chapter 7, we offer examples of ways to mix up your training.\\n\\nSo how do you know what your maximum heart rate is? Well, we don’t recom- mend running as hard as you can until you keel over, and then counting your heartbeats for one minute. A safer and more accurate way is to have your max measured by a professional such as a physician or exercise specialist. (See Chapter 2 for details on exercise testing.) You can also use a number of mathematical formulas to estimate your max.\\n\\nChapter 8: Cardio Crash Course\\n\\n113\\n\\nThe most time-honored method for determining maximum heart rate is for men to subtract their age from 220 and for women to subtract their age from 226. Keep in mind that this formula gives you only an estimate. Your true max may be as many as 15 beats higher or lower. Also, this formula is generally used for activities during which your feet hit the ground. (To estimate your max for bicycling, subtract about five beats from the final result; for swim- ming, subtract about ten beats.)\\n\\nUsing that easy formula to find your max, find your target heart-rate zone by calculating 50 percent and 85 percent of your maximum. Here’s the math for a 40-year-old man:\\n\\n220 – 40 = 180\\n\\nThis is his estimated maximum heart rate.\\n\\n180 × 0.50 = 90\\n\\nThis is the low end of his target zone. If his heart beats less than 90 times per minute, he knows that he’s not pushing hard enough.\\n\\n180 × 0.85 = 153\\n\\nThis is the high end of his target zone. If his heart beats faster than 153 beats per minute, he needs to slow down.\\n\\nOkay, so now you know how to figure out your target heart-rate zone. But how do you know if you’re in the zone? In other words, how do you know how fast your heart is beating at any given moment? As we mention earlier in this chapter, you can check your heart rate in two ways: taking your pulse manually or using a heart-rate monitor.\\n\\nTaking your pulse manually Watch any quality aerobics video or take any decent cardio class at the gym, and you hear the instructor yell out, “Okay, everybody, time for a heart-rate check.” On this cue, the participants place their fingers on their necks or on their wrists. Taking your pulse manually can be wildly inaccurate, so concen- trate when you do it.\\n\\nTo use the neck method, place your index and middle fingers (not your thumb) in the groove on either side of your throat pipe. When you feel a beat, you’ve found your carotid artery. The neck method isn’t our favorite because your heart rate is harder to find on your neck and because some experts feel that the act of pressing against this artery may actually shut off blood and oxygen supply to the brain, causing you to faint. If you use this method, be careful not to push too hard. We prefer the wrist method, which we explain in Chapter 2.\\n\\n114 Part III: Getting to the Heart of the Matter\\n\\nWhichever method you choose, you don’t need to keep your fingers on your neck or wrist for an entire minute while you count the beats. Feel the steady pounding of blood flowing through your arteries. When you’re fairly comfort- able with the rhythm, count how many beats you feel in 15 seconds. Then multiply this number by four — voilá, your heart rate.\\n\\nIf you flunked Mr. Dyshuck’s fifth-grade math class and multiplying by four proves to be out of your range of talents, that’s okay. Just take your pulse for 6 seconds and add a zero onto the number of beats you count; this, in effect, is multiplying by 10. For example: You take your pulse for 6 seconds and count 14 beats. Add a zero and you get 140 — that’s approximately how many times per minute your heart is beating. Just know that this shortcut method can be extremely inaccurate. If you miss a single beat, you miscalculate your heart rate by 10 beats per minute. We mention this method only because it’s commonly used in health clubs.\\n\\nDuring your workout, take your pulse about every 15 minutes and be sure to concentrate. Otherwise, you may end up counting the number of steps you take on the stair-climber rather than the number of pulses in your wrist. You may want to slow down or even stop while you take your pulse. True, this is disruptive to your workout, but it’s not nearly as disruptive as getting launched off the treadmill.\\n\\nUsing a heart-rate monitor You can eliminate the inaccuracy and inconvenience of taking your heart rate by wearing a heart-rate monitor. With a monitor, you don’t need to stop exer- cising or take the time to count anything. At any given moment you can find out your heart rate by glancing at your wrist. A good monitor can cost less than $60. The really fancy ones cost up to $400. They offer features such as a clock, a timer, and an alarm that you can set to beep when you wander out of your target zone.\\n\\nMost of the cardio equipment in gyms is now “heart-rate-monitor compatible.” The machines pick up the signal from the monitor, and your heart rate pops up on the display console, so you don’t have to wear the wrist watch. This saves you the trouble of bringing your wrist up to your eyeball while you’re moving.\\n\\nThe most accurate type of monitor is the chest-strap variety, which operates on the same principle as a medical electrocardiogram (ECG). You hook an inch-wide strap around your chest. This strap acts as an electrode to mea- sure the electrical activity of your heart. This information is then translated into a number, which is transmitted via radio signals to a wrist receiver that looks like a watch with a large face. All you have to do is look at your wrist, and you instantly know how many times your heart is beating that moment, whether it’s 92 or 164. Turn to Chapter 25 for more details on purchasing a monitor.\\n\\nChapter 8: Cardio Crash Course\\n\\n115\\n\\nChest monitors are very accurate, but some are subject to interference from electromagnetic waves like those given off by some treadmills and stair- climbers. (Better, newer models come equipped with coded signals that prevent this interference.) Exercising next to someone else who’s wearing a monitor may also scramble signals, a sort of electronic equivalent of getting your braces locked with someone else’s when you’re kissing. You may need at least 4 feet between users for monitors to function properly, although several companies now offer models with a special device to eliminate interference.\\n\\nLess accurate than chest monitors are photo-optic models, often sold with home equipment. These clip onto your earlobe or fingertip and detect the heartbeat there. Your heart rate shows up on a handheld or clip-on digital screen or special wristwatch. Those models cost only about $30, but any movement of your wrist, hand, or fingers can cause highly erratic or false readings. Daylight, poor circulation, and high-intensity exercise may also skew the results.\\n\\nHow Much Do You Need to Do?\\n\\nUnless you’re a professional athlete or wealthier than the average Third World dictator, you probably don’t have unlimited time to work out. So you may be wondering: Just how much cardio exercise does it really take to get fit?\\n\\nThe answer depends on your goals. Exercise is not an all-or-nothing proposi- tion. You can be fit to live a long life, fit to bicycle 30 miles, fit to run the Mount Everest Marathon (there really is such a thing) — or anywhere in between. In the cardio plans near the end of this chapter, we discuss how long, how often, and how hard you need to exercise in order to achieve three general goals: good health, fat loss, and maximum fitness. We also explain how you can cut back on your workouts during a serious time crunch without losing your fitness.\\n\\nThat said, recent research published in the Archives of Internal Medicine attempted to answer the question of how much exercise is needed to maintain body weight by placing subjects into four categories:\\n\\n(cid:2) No exercise at all (cid:2) Low amount of exercise (12 miles per week of walking or running) with\\n\\nmoderate intensity (equivalent to 4 to 5.5 in Table 8-1)\\n\\n(cid:2) Low amount of exercise (12 miles per week of walking or running) with\\n\\nvigorous intensity (also 6.5 to 8 in Table 8-1)\\n\\n(cid:2) High amount of exercise (20 miles per week of walking or running) with\\n\\nvigorous intensity (6.5 to 8 in Table 8-1)\\n\\n116 Part III: Getting to the Heart of the Matter\\n\\nThe subjects did not change their total caloric intake or alter the makeup of their diets. Researchers discovered that 73 percent of subjects in the control group (who didn’t exercise at all) gained weight during the study, indicating that some exercise is absolutely essential for maintaining weight. Perhaps not surprisingly, 75 percent of the other three groups lost weight and decreased in size. But here’s the best news: The high-amount/vigorous-intensity subjects lost far more weight and body fat and had the largest reductions in size (namely, waist circumference) of the four groups. Although the issue of how much exercise is enough won’t be resolved anytime soon, this study suggests that the most benefits are gained from combining a high amount of exercise with vigorous intensity.\\n\\nFollowing a Cardio Plan for Good Health\\n\\nIf your goal is to feel better and live longer, a little aerobic exercise goes a remarkably long way. Research shows that the people who gain the most from aerobic exercise are those who go from being completely slothful to only marginally slothful — not the ones who go from being fit to super fit. The people in the bottom 20 percent of the population, fitness-wise, are 65 percent more likely to die from heart attack, stroke, diabetes, or cancer than the highly fit people in the top 20 percent. However, when those couch pota- toes move up just one notch on the fitness scale, by simply adding a daily 30-minute walk, they’re only 10 percent more likely to die from these causes than super-fit people.\\n\\nIf you have no designs on hiking the Appalachian Trail or losing 50 pounds, you may want to know the minimum amount of exercise that can make a dif- ference in your health. Here are some answers.\\n\\nHow often you need to do cardio for good health\\n\\nResearch suggests that you can lower your risk of heart disease just by walk- ing for 20 minutes three times a week. This typically is enough exercise to increase your energy level and stamina, too, although not enough to cause much in the way of fat loss. If you’re a beginner, we recommend working out five or six days rather than three days a week (keeping the workouts short) simply so you get in the habit of exercising.\\n\\nChapter 8: Cardio Crash Course\\n\\n117\\n\\nHow long your workouts should last for good health\\n\\nIf your goal is to improve your health, you do not need to do all your exercise in big chunks. Nowhere is it written — in the U.S. Constitution, the Talmud, or the California Penal Code — that in order to benefit from aerobic exercise, you need to do it for 30 consecutive minutes. Studies show that doing three ten-minute bouts of aerobic exercise has nearly the same health benefits as doing one half-hour session.\\n\\nHow hard you need to push for good health\\n\\nIf you’re simply looking to feel better and improve the quality of your every- day life, being active is the key, even if you don’t always reach your target zone (see the “Your target heart-rate zone” section earlier in this chapter). However, to realize the maximum health benefits — significantly lowering your heart-disease risk, for example — it’s wise to work out in your target zone the majority of the time. Plus, even if you have modest goals, you may want to crank up your intensity just to keep things interesting.\\n\\nRealize that, when you’re a beginner, any exercise you do is high-intensity exercise. As you get more fit, you need to adapt your routine to match your increasing strength and lung power. When Liz’s mom started working out, she couldn’t complete 10 minutes on the treadmill at 2 mph. After three months, she was able to do 20 minutes at 4 mph — an improvement that in the begin- ning would have seemed inconceivable.\\n\\nFollowing a Cardio Plan for Weight Loss\\n\\nIf your goal is permanent fat loss, the “cardio plan for good health” isn’t going to cut it. You simply won’t burn enough calories to make a significant impact. Here’s why: In order to lose a pound in one week, you need to create a 3,500- calorie deficit; in other words, you need to burn off 3,500 more calories than you eat. A 30-minute power walk on flat ground burns about 120 calories. (See the “Which activities burn the most calories” section later in this chap- ter.) So, to burn off 1 pound of fat by walking, you’d have to hoof it for more than 2 hours a day.\\n\\n118 Part III: Getting to the Heart of the Matter\\n\\nDon’t worry — we’re not suggesting that you exercise two hours every day! In fact, we think the best way to lose fat is to create a calorie deficit by burning calories through exercise and cutting calories you eat. For example, over the course of a week, you may cut 250 calories per day by switching from mayo to mustard on your sandwich at lunch and snacking on Yoplait Lite yogurt instead of Columbo Fruit-on-the-Bottom. Meanwhile, you could burn an extra 250 calories a day by taking a one-hour walk or a half-hour jog.\\n\\nCardio exercise is only one part of a weight-loss plan. You also need to revamp your eating habits (see Chapter 7 for tips) and embark on a weight-training program (see Chapter 11 to find out why). Also, keep in mind that losing weight is not as easy as it sounds on TV diet commercials. It takes a lot more commit- ment than just drinking that delicious shake for breakfast. And it takes time. Don’t try to lose more than 1⁄2 pound to 1 pound each week, and don’t eat fewer than 1,200 calories per day (preferably more). On a super-low-calorie diet, you deprive your body of essential nutrients, and you have a tougher time keeping the weight off because your metabolism slows down. Realize, too, that genetics plays a large role in weight loss. It’s easier for some people to lose weight than it is for others.\\n\\nHere are some general cardio guidelines for weight loss. We suggest that you consult a registered dietitian and certified fitness trainer to come up with a plan best suited to your specific goals and schedule.\\n\\nHow often you need to do cardio for weight loss\\n\\nHere’s the cold, hard truth: You probably need to do five or six workouts a week.\\n\\nHow long your workouts should last for weight loss\\n\\nHere’s another dose of reality: You should aim for at least 45 minutes of exer- cise, a mix of cardio and strength training, six days per week. Again, you don’t need to do all this sweating at once, but for the pounds to come off, the calo- ries you burn need to add up.\\n\\nHow hard you need to push for weight loss\\n\\nTo make a serious dent in your fat-loss program, we suggest that you work out in your target zone most of the time. But keep in mind: If you’re pretty\\n\\nChapter 8: Cardio Crash Course\\n\\n119\\n\\ndarned “deconditioned,” as the politically correct like to say, even exercising at 50 percent of your maximum heart rate can help build up your fitness level.\\n\\nYou may have heard that exercising at a slow pace is more effective for weight loss than working out more intensely. In fact, many cardio machines have “fat burning” programs that keep you at a slow pace. But this is mislead- ing. As it turns out, the concept of a fat-burning zone is no more real than the Twilight Zone.\\n\\nDuring low-intensity aerobic exercise, your body does use fat as its primary fuel source. As you get closer to your breaking point, your body starts using a smaller percentage of fat and a larger percentage of carbohydrates, another fuel source. However, picking up the pace allows you to burn more total calo- ries, as well as more fat calories.\\n\\nHere’s how: If you go in-line skating for 30 minutes at a leisurely roll, you might burn about 100 calories — about 80 percent of them from fat (so that’s 80 fat calories). But if you spend the same amount of time skating with a vengeance over a hilly course, you might burn 300 calories — 30 percent of them from fat (that’s 90 fat calories). So at the fast pace, you burn more than double the calories and 10 more fat calories.\\n\\nOf course, going faster and harder is not always better. If you’re just starting out, you probably can’t sustain a faster pace long enough to make it worth your while. If you go slower, you may be able to exercise a lot longer, so you’ll end up burning more calories and fat that way.\\n\\nWhich activities burn the most calories\\n\\n“Maximize your workout and burn over 1,000 calories per hour!” That’s a claim you may see in advertisements for treadmills, stair-climbers, and other cardio machines. And it’s true. You can burn 1,000 calories per hour doing those activities — if you crank up the machine to the highest level and if you happen to have bionic legs. If you’re a beginner, you’ll last about 30 seconds at that pace, at which point you will have burned 8.3 calories, and the para- medics will be scooping you off the floor and hauling your wilted body away on a stretcher.\\n\\nThere’s a better approach to calorie burning: Choose an activity that you can sustain for a good while — say, at least 10 or 15 minutes. Sure, running burns more calories than walking, but if running wipes you out after a half mile or bothers your knees, you’re better off walking.\\n\\nTable 8-2 gives calorie estimates for a number of popular aerobic activities. The number of calories you actually burn depends on the intensity of your workout, your weight, your muscle mass, and your metabolism. In general, a beginner is capable of burning 4 or 5 calories per minute of exercise, while a very fit person can burn 10 to 12 calories per minute.\\n\\n120 Part III: Getting to the Heart of the Matter\\n\\nThe table includes a few stop-and-go sports such as tennis and basketball. Activities like these are not aerobic in the truest sense, but they can still give you a great workout and contribute to good health and weight loss. The num- bers in this chart apply to a 150-pound person. (If you weigh less, you’ll burn a little less; if you weigh more, you’ll burn a little more.)\\n\\nTable 8-2\\n\\nCalories Burned during Popular Activities\\n\\nActivity\\n\\n15 min.\\n\\n30 min.\\n\\n45 min.\\n\\n60 min.\\n\\nAerobic dance\\n\\n171\\n\\n342\\n\\n513\\n\\n684\\n\\nBasketball\\n\\n141\\n\\n282\\n\\n432\\n\\n564\\n\\nBicycling at 12 mph\\n\\n142\\n\\n283\\n\\n425\\n\\n566\\n\\nBicycling at 15 mph\\n\\n177\\n\\n354\\n\\n531\\n\\n708\\n\\nBicycling at 18 mph\\n\\n213\\n\\n425\\n\\n638\\n\\n850\\n\\nBoxing\\n\\n165\\n\\n330\\n\\n495\\n\\n660\\n\\nCircuit weight training\\n\\n189\\n\\n378\\n\\n576\\n\\n756\\n\\nCross-country skiing\\n\\n146\\n\\n291\\n\\n437\\n\\n583\\n\\nDownhill skiing\\n\\n105\\n\\n210\\n\\n315\\n\\n420\\n\\nGolf (carrying clubs)\\n\\n87\\n\\n174\\n\\n261\\n\\n348\\n\\nIn-line skating\\n\\n150\\n\\n300\\n\\n450\\n\\n600\\n\\nJumping rope, 60–80 skips/min.\\n\\n143\\n\\n286\\n\\n429\\n\\n572\\n\\nKarate, tae kwon do\\n\\n192\\n\\n834\\n\\n576\\n\\n768\\n\\nKayaking\\n\\n75\\n\\n150\\n\\n225\\n\\n300\\n\\nRacquetball\\n\\n114\\n\\n228\\n\\n342\\n\\n456\\n\\nRowing machine\\n\\n104\\n\\n208\\n\\n310\\n\\n415\\n\\nRunning 10-minute miles\\n\\n183\\n\\n365\\n\\n548\\n\\n731\\n\\nRunning 8-minute miles\\n\\n223\\n\\n446\\n\\n670\\n\\n893\\n\\nSki machine\\n\\n141\\n\\n282\\n\\n423\\n\\n564\\n\\nSlide\\n\\n152\\n\\n304\\n\\n456\\n\\n608\\n\\nSwimming freestyle, 35 yds/min.\\n\\n124\\n\\n248\\n\\n371\\n\\n497\\n\\nSwimming freestyle, 50 yds/min.\\n\\n131\\n\\n261\\n\\n392\\n\\n523\\n\\nChapter 8: Cardio Crash Course\\n\\n121\\n\\nActivity\\n\\n15 min.\\n\\n30 min.\\n\\n45 min.\\n\\n60 min.\\n\\nTennis, singles\\n\\n116\\n\\n232\\n\\n348\\n\\n464\\n\\nTennis, doubles\\n\\n43\\n\\n85\\n\\n128\\n\\n170\\n\\nVersaClimber, 100 ft./min.\\n\\n188\\n\\n375\\n\\n563\\n\\n750\\n\\nWalking, 20-minute miles, flat\\n\\n60\\n\\n120\\n\\n180\\n\\n240\\n\\nWalking, 20-minute miles, hills\\n\\n81\\n\\n162\\n\\n243\\n\\n324\\n\\nWalking, 15-minute miles, flat\\n\\n73\\n\\n146\\n\\n219\\n\\n292\\n\\nWalking, 15-minute miles, hills\\n\\n102\\n\\n206\\n\\n279\\n\\n412\\n\\nWater aerobics\\n\\n70\\n\\n140\\n\\n210\\n\\n280\\n\\nFollowing a Cardio Plan to Maximize Your Fitness\\n\\nWhen you get the hang of this exercise thing, you may find that you want more of a challenge. Instead of being satisfied with a boost in energy and a decrease in heart-disease risk, you may want to test yourself in a 5K run or a weeklong hiking tour of Canada.\\n\\nBernie Kalkbrenner, a funeral director we know from Duluth, Minnesota, smoked 21⁄2 packs of cigarettes a day for 25 years. One day, Bernie realized that if he didn’t get his act together, he was going to become one of his own customers. So he quit smoking and took up bicycling. At age 51, he cycled 3,230 miles across the United States in less than seven weeks. “I’ve never felt this good in my life,” Bernie said upon finishing. “To be able to pedal my butt up a hill without any shortness of breath — that’s exhilarating.”\\n\\nHow can you get in shape like Bernie? In Chapter 10, we offer specific tips on how to train for several outdoor sports, including cycling. The following sec- tions also give you some general tips for getting in really good cardio shape. Be sure to increase your training gradually; don’t go longer, more often, and harder all at once. Otherwise, you really increase your chances of injuring yourself. In other words, it’s not a great idea to do three 20-minute workouts one week and then jump to three 45-minute workouts the next. It’s more sen- sible to increase the time of just one of your workouts to 25 minutes and keep the others at 20.\\n\\nThe best approach is to increase no more than 10 percent each week. So, if you walk 150 minutes one week, walk no more than 165 minutes the next.\\n\\n122 Part III: Getting to the Heart of the Matter\\n\\nTreat getting into good cardiovascular shape like a really important ongoing project. You may struggle through the first session, maybe even the first five to ten. But if you stick with it three times a week for at least six weeks, you’ll start to notice dramatic changes. At that point, you’ll recover much more quickly from your workouts. Instead of going home and crashing on the couch, you may feel ready to go bowling or out for a walk.\\n\\nHow often you need to do cardio for maximum fitness\\n\\nFive days a week is a good goal to shoot for. Most people feel best with two days off a week; everyone should take at least one day of complete rest. In the “Giving It a Rest” section later in this chapter, we explain how to tell whether you need more rest.\\n\\nHow long your workouts should last for maximum fitness\\n\\nDepending on your sport and your goal, you probably need to mix in at least a couple long workouts — an hour or more — per week. Just make sure you don’t increase the length of your workouts by more than 10 percent a week; otherwise, your risk of injury shoots pretty high.\\n\\nHow hard you need to push for maximum fitness\\n\\nEven when you’re training to get in your best shape ever, you don’t want to go all-out every day. (In fact, only serious athletes peaking for an event should ever go all-out — and even then, only once or twice a week.) Your target zone includes a large range of intensity levels. On some days, stay near the bottom of the range and go for a longer workout; on other days, push harder and go for a shorter workout. Try any or all of the training techniques described in the next section.\\n\\nFour ways to boost your fitness\\n\\nYou can play plenty of games to challenge your body. This section discusses four training techniques that you can try after about a month or two of train- ing at 50 to 60 percent of your maximum heart rate. The less conditioning you start with, the more cautious you should be.\\n\\nChapter 8: Cardio Crash Course\\n\\n123\\n\\n(cid:2) Interval training: With interval training, you alternate short, fairly\\n\\nintense spurts of exercise with periods of relatively easy exercise. For example, say you’re out bicycling. After warming up for 15 minutes or so, you may try cycling all-out for 30 seconds and follow this with a few minutes of easy pedaling until your heart rate slows down a little, to about 120 or fewer beats per minute. Then you do another tough 30-second interval, and so on. In essence, you’re switching between the low and high ends of your target zone.\\n\\nWhen you first try interval training, keep the high-intensity periods short — 15 to 30 seconds. Follow these periods with at least three times as much active rest (so, 45 to 90 seconds). Active rest means that you keep moving between intervals instead of stopping dead. So after you do that 30-second bike sprint, pedal slowly for about 90 seconds. You may need even more recovery than that, especially if you’re a beginner. As you become more accustomed to higher levels, you can increase the length of the high-intensity intervals as you decrease the length of the low-intensity intervals. Eventually, you can aim for a 1:1 hard-to-easy ratio, measuring intervals in terms of time or distance.\\n\\n(cid:2) Fartlek: This charming word means “speed play” in Swedish. Fartlek is basically interval training without an exact measure of time or distance. You just do your intervals whenever you feel like it. You may try sprinting to every other telephone pole. Or set your sights on that horse standing in the field down the road and pick up your pace until you reach him. (cid:2) Uphill battles: You can add hills to walking, biking, running, or skating workouts. You have to work harder when you come to a hill, but ulti- mately you’re rewarded with extra strength and stamina. As a bonus, going uphill can burn twice as many calories as exercising on flat land. One fun drill is to do hill repeats. Find a long, fairly steep hill and then sprint up it and jog down it, repeating this sequence four to eight times.\\n\\nHere’s a trick to make hill workouts seem easier: Pick a landmark that’s partway up the hill, such as a bush or mailbox. Pretend that you have a rope in your hands and cast it over your landmark. Now pull yourself up the hill with your imaginary rope. When you reach your landmark, cast your rope on something farther up the hill and keep doing this until you reach the top.\\n\\n(cid:2) Tempo workouts: Tempo workouts help you learn to move faster. During a tempo drill, you move at a pace that you consider challenging but not brutal, keeping that pace for four to ten minutes. Do that a couple of times each workout. In between, exercise at your normal pace. If you’re new to tempo training, begin with short tempos and gradually increase their length. Anyone training for a local road race or a bike-a-thon will find tempo work helpful.\\n\\n124 Part III: Getting to the Heart of the Matter\\n\\nTraining for a specific event\\n\\nThinking of training for a 5K or 10K race, half-marathon, century bike ride, or triathlon? Ideally, you want to spend at least 16 weeks (about 4 months) preparing for your event. Take the first six to ten weeks just getting used to running, cycling, swimming, and so on, slowly building your weekly mileage at 10 percent each week. Starting at about 9 to 11 weeks, begin using the techniques listed in the “Four ways to boost your fitness” section earlier, mixing them into your routine. For example, one week, you might do uphill training one day; the next week, you might try a tempo workout on a Monday and a fartlek on a Thursday. In between, you run, cycle, or swim at a more moderate pace or take a day off, allowing your body time to recover before your next workout. By 16 weeks, you should be ready for the big day.\\n\\nFor more specific information about training for a running event, check out Wiley Publishing’s Running For Dummies, by Florence Griffith-Joyner and Jon Hanc, or Marathon Training For Dummies, by Tere Stouffer Drenth, which includes information on racing at distances from 5K to marathons.\\n\\nGiving It a Rest\\n\\nFor most people, exercising too much is about as big a problem as saving too much money. However, some beginners — in their zeal to make up for 20 years of neglecting their bodies — vow to exercise every day for the next 20 years. This is not a good idea. If you’re trying to get fit, your workouts are only part of the equation; rest is just as important.\\n\\nAim for a balance between hard days and easy days. If you do an intense interval day on Monday, do an easy workout Tuesday. If you do two tough days in a row, your legs may feel like someone inserted lead pipes in them while you were sleeping. Everyone should rest at least one day a week. (Just don’t let that one day off slip into three years.) And when we say take a rest day, we mean no exercise. Nada. Zippo. An easy day does not count as a rest day. In addition to taking a day or two off each week, you may also want to take an easy week every month or two. So if you usually jog 15 miles a week, cut back to 7 just for the week. Drastic cutbacks can help remotivate you and give your body the vacation it may need.\\n\\nThere’s no magic formula to determine exactly how much rest is best for your goals and fitness level. But here’s a good rule: If you’re doing everything right, you should be able to wake up in the morning and say, “I know my workout’s going to be really good,” rather than, “How the heck am I gonna drag my butt to the gym?”\\n\\nChapter 8: Cardio Crash Course\\n\\n125\\n\\nWhat happens if you stop exercising?\\n\\nAerobic conditioning is a use-it-or-lose-it propo- sition. A couple of days of inactivity won’t set you back, but if you continue to slack off, your improvements fade in a matter of weeks. Research indicates that most of the benefits from aerobic training are lost within two weeks to three months.\\n\\nsuddenly, tax time arrives, and for two months you’re buried in 1099s, IRS long forms, and 401(k) plans. Well, instead of abandoning exer- cise altogether, which would practically guar- antee that you lose all your conditioning, you can cut back and still maintain your fitness for up to 12 weeks.\\n\\nBut there’s good news, too. You can preserve your hard-earned fitness even if you go through a period when you don’t exercise as much as usual. Suppose you’re a CPA. You get into a really good routine of jogging on the treadmill four days a week for a half-hour, and you keep up the routine for four straight months. Then,\\n\\nInstead of running 30 minutes 4 days a week, you could get by with 30 minutes twice a week or 15 minutes 4 times a week. The only require- ment is that you keep up your usual pace. When you get back to your regular routine after tax time, you may find that you’ve lost no fitness at all — or maybe just a tiny bit.\\n\\nExercisers of all levels are susceptible to overtraining. For an elite athlete, overtraining might be running 80 miles in a week; for a beginner, running 8 miles might be too much. Here are some signs that you’ve overdone it:\\n\\n(cid:2) Your resting heart rate sounds like a jackhammer drilling through\\n\\nconcrete. In other words, if your heart rate is way above what it normally is — say, about 10 beats — take it very easy or take a day or two off. (For details about your resting heart rate, see Chapter 2.)\\n\\n(cid:2) You feel chronically sore or weak. If you lift a ketchup bottle and it\\n\\nfeels like a 10-pound dumbbell, stay home.\\n\\n(cid:2) You get chronic colds and infections. (cid:2) You’re not sleeping well. (cid:2) You’re irritable, anxious, or depressed. It’s not a good sign if you lock your keys in your car and smash the window to retrieve them instead of calling the auto club.\\n\\n(cid:2) You can’t concentrate or you feel disoriented. If you make a left-hand\\n\\nturn signal while you’re on a stationary bike, it’s time for a rest.\\n\\n126 Part III: Getting to the Heart of the Matter\\n\\nChapter 9 Using Cardio Machines\\n\\nIn This Chapter (cid:1) Knowing whether to trust calorie counters on cardio machines (cid:1) Fighting boredom in your cardio workout (cid:1) Using an elliptical trainer, treadmill, stationary bike, stair-climber, VersaClimber, or\\n\\nrowing machine\\n\\nencounter rows of high-tech contraptions that appear to be part video game, part escalator, and part lawn mower. Don’t be alarmed. The consoles of these machines may resemble the control panel of Apollo 13, but with a little help, even a rookie can understand all the flashing red dots and beeping green arrows. Be thankful for all this technology because it makes indoor aerobic exercise a lot more fun than it used to be. For all your sweat, the screen offers you instant gratification — the number of miles that you walk, steps that you climb, minutes that you cycle, and calories that you burn.\\n\\nWalk into a health club or fitness-equipment store and you’re likely to\\n\\nCardiovascular machines tend to come and go. Since the first edition of this book, we’ve seen the rise and fall of various riders, gliders, and skaters. So we’re not going to give you a rundown of every crazy invention that’s made its way onto an infomercial. Instead, this chapter covers the solid, proven machines, such as treadmills, rowers, bikes, and stair-climbers, as well as a relative newcomer that we believe is here to stay: the elliptical trainer. We tell you how to take the drudgery out of exercising in place and how to posi- tion your body on each machine so that you burn the most calories and avoid injury.\\n\\n128 Part III: Getting to the Heart of the Matter\\n\\nCan You Trust Those Calorie Counters?\\n\\nAt the gym one day, Suzanne was pumping away on the stair-climber next to a very fit woman. For a brief moment, the woman looked away from her machine to say hello to a friend. When she looked back, her 45-minute workout had ended, and she had missed the final calorie readout. Horrified, the woman uttered several curse words and then stormed into the locker room — as if not knowing her exact calorie burn negated the entire 45 minutes of effort.\\n\\nThat may be an extreme case, but most of us do get a psychological boost from knowing how many calories we just burned. There’s just one problem: The information may not be accurate.\\n\\nFor the most part, the formulas used to calculate calories burned are derived from tests done on healthy young males — and in some cases, elite athletes working near their maximum effort. This does not always translate accurately for the rest of us. For instance, a recent study conducted found that fitness equipment readouts may overestimate calorie count for obese women by as much as 80 calories for 30 minutes of moderate intensity walking.\\n\\nOther research has found that calorie predictions are skewed even further if you lean your body weight against the handrails, grip tightly, or otherwise position your body on a machine in a way that makes the exercise less stren- uous. Some studies have shown that calculations can be off by as much as 50 percent.\\n\\nSometimes it’s not the formulas or your technique that skew the calorie count; it’s the deceptive marketing strategy of the machine’s manufacturer. A researcher for one cardio-equipment manufacturer admitted to us that his company intentionally boosts the calorie information by as much as 30 percent so that people may, subconsciously, prefer their machines over other brands.\\n\\nWe suspect that elliptical machines (described in the “Elliptical trainer” section later in this chapter) have particularly generous calorie readouts. Case in point: When Liz does a fairly easy elliptical workout, the machine tells her that she burns 12 calories per minute — a number that seems suspiciously high. In fact, in order to achieve the same calorie burn on the treadmill (known to be an accurate machine), she needs to run at a brisk 8 mph, a pace that shoots her heart rate way up into the huff-and-puff zone. We’re skeptical that these two workouts are equivalent.\\n\\nThe most accurate machines tend to be the treadmill and the stationary bike because the contraptions have been so well studied. In recent years, stair- climbers have adjusted calorie estimates drastically downward to better reflect reality.\\n\\nThe bottom line: Realize that the calorie figures are simply estimates.\\n\\nChapter 9: Using Cardio Machines\\n\\n129\\n\\nUse the calorie information to motivate you, but don’t be a slave to it, and don’t rely on the numbers to validate your efforts.\\n\\nCombating Boredom on Aerobic Machines\\n\\nIt’s no coincidence that “treadmill” is listed under “tedium” in Roget’s Thesaurus; imitating a laboratory rodent is not among life’s thrills. No matter what type of exercise machine you use and no matter how many flashing dots you’re rewarded with, boredom is bound to hit you at some point. In this section, we suggest ways to divert your attention so that your 20, 30, or 40 minutes pass before you know it. Eventually, you may actually begin to enjoy the sensations of sweat and fatigue, and using these machines won’t seem like a chore.\\n\\nTake a cardio-machine class\\n\\nIt used to be that if you wanted a cardio workout in the company of a perky instructor and enthusiastic classmates, you had to take step aerobics or some type of dance class. But now the group-exercise concept includes machines, too. The trend started with indoor cycling classes known as spin- ning or studio cycling and has since expanded to treadmills, stair-climbers, and rowing machines. Group cycling has become so popular that most new clubs now build separate rooms for these classes. (See Chapter 4 for more details about group cycling.) Treadmill classes that go by the name of Treading and Trekking are also catching on. Concept II, a top rowing machine brand, has developed a half-hour group class called Boathouse, and StairMaster has introduced a 20-minute climbing class called Stomp.\\n\\nInstructors of these cardio classes guide you through a workout as if you’re running, climbing, or rowing outdoors. You imagine bounding up pristine mountain hills, sprinting through meadows, or finishing the Tour de France. A good instructor can make the experience so much fun that you almost forget you’re in a room with a dozen other stinky, sweaty people going absolutely nowhere.\\n\\nVary your workouts\\n\\nIf you don’t want to take a class or you work out at home, you can make your workouts more entertaining simply by varying your pace. Most machines have a manual mode that allows you to control the intensity of the workout.\\n\\n130 Part III: Getting to the Heart of the Matter\\n\\nYou push one arrow to speed up the pace, another to slow it down. Use the manual mode to design your own workouts, incorporating the training tech- niques that we describe in Chapter 8.\\n\\nYou should also experiment with the various programs already entered in the computer’s memory. These programs are great because you don’t have to decide what to do next. Most programs have built-in warm-up and cooldown periods; in between, you vary your pace. For instance, many machines offer a random program; every 10 to 30 seconds, the machine surprises you by changing the tension. Most treadmills offer programs like “A Romp in the Park,” which may be a 3-mile walk or jog over rolling hills. The treadmill automatically inclines and declines during these workouts.\\n\\nListen to music or a book on tape\\n\\nRock, rap, pop, or country — go with whatever gets your adrenaline pumping. If Shania Twain works for you, so be it. A tape that mixes fast and slow songs can add variety to your workout, because your pace tends to be in sync with the music. One study showed that women who exercised to music lasted 25 percent longer than those who worked out in silence. At some gyms you can plug your headphones into a system that offers dozens of CD selections and audio channels.\\n\\nOr try listening to a book on tape. You may prefer to get wrapped up in a good story or learn how to manage your love life. If you rely on a tape or CD player to keep you going, make sure that you keep a load of extra batteries in your gym bag. We can’t count the times we’ve shown up at the gym with our tape players only to find that the batteries are dead — along with our motivation.\\n\\nAt some gyms, you can listen to music without the need for batteries, or even a tape or CD player. At these clubs, the cardio machines are equipped with high-tech systems: Attached to each treadmill, bike, or other machine is a tape and CD player, along with a small TV screen that even offers Internet access. The only catch is you have to buy special wireless headphones that cost up to $100. These systems require you to bring your own headphones and plug them into a small box attached to the machine. Or, you need your own personal stereo and must tune into an FM frequency to pick up the vari- ous TV stations.\\n\\nWatch TV or a video\\n\\nPark your stationary bike in front of your TV and tune in to whatever you consider entertaining, whether it’s Truckin’ USA on Country Music Television or British Parliament debates on C-SPAN. You can also pop in a video designed for indoor exercise workouts. For example, you can buy videos that simulate\\n\\nChapter 9: Using Cardio Machines\\n\\n131\\n\\na group cycling class, including hill sprints and interval drills. Other videos, designed for bikes, treadmills, and stair-climbers, transport you to the Grand Canyon, a Hawaiian rain forest, or the Swiss Alps. You can find a selection of these videos in the resources we describe in Chapter 19.\\n\\nIf you work out at a gym, plug into the TVs that are either suspended in front of the cardio machines or attached to each individual contraption. (We’re fond of all this new technology; gone are the days when you had to negotiate with your fellow gym members to find a mutually agreeable show. Suzanne once had to miss a crucial episode of Melrose Place because two guys on the bikes next to her insisted on watching a basketball game. The nerve. . . .)\\n\\nRead a magazine\\n\\nKill two birds with one stone: Burn calories while you catch up on your read- ing. Suzanne is a much more informed citizen during the winter, when she spends a fair amount of time on the stair-climber, than she is during the summer, when she’s outside on her road bike.\\n\\nThis is a good time to read the fitness magazines we talk about in the Appendix. Exercise magazines offer lots of encouragement and tend to contain easy-to-skim lists. When you’re drenched in sweat on the elliptical trainer, taking in “Ten Ways to Boost Energy and Get Stronger” is a lot easier than concentrating on an essay about Indonesian politics. Note: As we explain in the “Treadmill” section later in this chapter, don’t read while you’re walking or running on the treadmill.\\n\\nExercise in short spurts\\n\\nTo break up the monotony, do ten minutes on the treadmill, followed by ten minutes on the bike, and then ten minutes on the rowing machine. Or try short bouts on a cardio machine with five minutes of weight lifting. As we explain in Chapter 8, it’s a myth that you must exercise for 20 or 30 consecutive min- utes. Breaking up your workout into small chunks isn’t a good strategy to use every day if you’re training for a marathon, but if your goal is simply to burn calories and improve your health, the total time you spend exercising is what matters most.\\n\\nThink, but not too hard\\n\\nPeople tend to have their most creative ideas when they’re doing something repetitive that doesn’t involve their mind completely. But don’t set out to solve the U.S. health-care crisis during your workout. Instead, use your time\\n\\n132 Part III: Getting to the Heart of the Matter\\n\\nto ponder more solvable dilemmas, like how you can get your boss off your back. You may even want to keep a tape recorder handy, in case a flash of brilliance comes along.\\n\\nMonitor your heart rate\\n\\nTo keep yourself occupied, use a heart-rate monitor to create an interval pro- gram. For instance, after warming up, alternate five minutes at the low end of your target zone with five minutes at the high end. (If all this talk about moni- tors, intervals, and target zones is complete gibberish to you, read Chapter 8.)\\n\\nMany machines have heart-rate monitors built into them. Your heart rate registers when you grasp the handles. Or, you can wear a strap around your chest; the machine picks up the signal from the strap and beams it to the console so that your heart rate is displayed right alongside your speed and distance. The strap is more accurate than the handles, but you do have to bring your own heart-rate-monitor chest strap from home, if your gym doesn’t provide them. Chapter 8 includes tips on buying a heart-rate monitor.\\n\\nTalk to a friend\\n\\nSome people think that if they’re able to speak while exercising, they must not be working hard enough to do their body any good. As we explain in Chapter 8, that’s not true. In general, your breathing should be light enough so that you can hold up your end of a conversation.\\n\\nOne health club in L.A. has started a book club. Members of the “Brains and Brawn” workout group do their reading at home and then convene on the treadmills and stair-climbers to discuss the latest murder mystery or popular novel. (Tolstoy and Dickens aren’t popular in this book club.)\\n\\nExercising in the Great Indoors\\n\\nMost exercisers have a favorite cardio machine and one that they probably can’t stand. Some people find the treadmill invigorating; others consider it more tedious than peeling potatoes. We suggest you try all the machines at your gym or at an equipment store before you buy one. No single cardio machine is better than the rest. What matters most is how often you use the thing.\\n\\nNo matter what machine you use, always keep a water bottle and a towel within reach. Many gym machines have water bottle holders, and you can buy them cheaply for your home equipment. Also, stay tuned to how your\\n\\nChapter 9: Using Cardio Machines\\n\\n133\\n\\nbody feels. If your knee hurts or you start to feel faint, don’t ignore the pain or try to drown it out by cranking up the volume on your stereo headphones. You may be damaging muscles or joints.\\n\\nThat said, here’s a look at the most popular cardiovascular machines.\\n\\nTreadmill\\n\\nTreadmills are the motorized equivalent of walking or running in place. You simply keep up with a belt that’s moving under your feet. Treadmill workouts burn about the same number of calories as walking or running outdoors. The only exception seems to be running uphill. When you incline the treadmill to simulate running uphill, it’s somewhat easier than running up real-life hills of the same grade. But walking uphill on a treadmill is virtually the same as walking uphill outdoors.\\n\\nWho will like it Treadmills are especially popular in crowded cities, where you need to be part cutting horse, part smog filter to run or walk through the streets. Treadmills are great for beginners because they require little coordination to use. Plus, treadmills can move at a slow enough pace to accommodate even the most out-of-shape exercisers. People with back pain, bad knees, or weak ankles often find treadmills kinder to their joints than concrete or cement. Today’s treadmills are springier and more shock-absorbing than ever. Many have added flashy new features, such as Internet hookups so that you can run and walk with other treadmillers from all over the globe. Some treadmills can store up to 100 personal programs.\\n\\nWho will hate it You need a very strong or very blank mind to do long workouts on a tread- mill. Most people find more than a half-hour on this machine mind-numbing, even with entertainment. If you crave the wind whipping through your hair and scenery flashing by, reserve the treadmills for emergency aerobic situa- tions only. Running also places more impact on your joints than most other exercises and may not be a favorite if you have a bad lower back, achy knees, or weak ankles.\\n\\nTreadmill user tips Treadmills are among the easiest cardio machines to use. Still, treadmill users are not immune to poor posture. And if you’re not paying attention, you can stumble. On occasion you may see someone slide off the treadmill like a can of beans on a supermarket conveyor belt. Here are some tips to make sure this doesn’t happen to you:\\n\\n134 Part III: Getting to the Heart of the Matter\\n\\n(cid:2) Start slowly. Most treadmills have safety features that prevent them from starting out at breakneck speeds, but don’t take any chances. Always place one foot on either side of the belt as you turn on the machine, and step on the belt only after you determine that it’s moving at the slow set-up speed, usually between 1 and 2 miles per hour.\\n\\n(cid:2) Don’t rely on the handrails. Holding on for balance when you learn how to use the machine is okay, but let go as soon as you feel comfortable. You move more naturally if you swing your arms freely. You’re working at too high a level if you have to imitate a water-skier — in other words, if you hold onto the front rails and lean back. This is a common phenom- enon among people who incline the treadmill, and this position is bad news for your elbows and for the machine. Plus, you’re not fooling anyone; you’re burning far fewer calories than the readout indicates. However, if you have balance issues, go ahead and grasp the handrails lightly so that you feel steady and secure.\\n\\n(cid:2) Look straight ahead. Your feet tend to follow your eyes, so if you focus on what’s in front of you, you usually walk straight ahead instead of veering off to the side. When you’re in the middle of a workout and someone calls your name, don’t turn around to answer. This piece of advice may seem obvious now, but wait until it happens to you.\\n\\n(cid:2) Expect to feel disoriented. The first few times you use a treadmill, you may feel dizzy when you step off. Your body is just wondering why the ground suddenly stopped moving. Don’t worry. Most people only experi- ence this vertigo once or twice.\\n\\n(cid:2) Never go barefoot. Always wear a good pair of walking or running shoes\\n\\nfor your treadmill workout.\\n\\n(cid:2) Don’t read on the treadmill. You risk losing your balance and stumbling\\n\\noff the side or back.\\n\\nElliptical trainer\\n\\nJust when we thought that all good cardio machines had been invented, along came the elliptical trainer. Ellipticals have two large, fat foot pedals. Your feet follow a path that’s sort of a stretched-out oval known as an ellipse (hence, the name elliptical trainer) — see Figure 9-1. The motion feels like a mix between fast walking, stair-climbing, and cross-country skiing. Precor, Reebok CCS, Life Fitness, StairMaster, and Startrac make the most popular models. The popularity of this machine has exploded in the past two years, rivaling that of the treadmill. Newer models allow you to work your arms in an opposite motion to your feet, which can get confusing if you think too much about it while exercising! Working your arms allows you to burn addi- tional calories, though.\\n\\nChapter 9: Using Cardio Machines\\n\\n135\\n\\nFigure 9-1: Elliptical trainers are gentle enough for prenatal workouts.\\n\\nPhotograph by John Urban\\n\\nWho will like it Runners who need a day off from the pounding gravitate toward this machine like moviegoers to the concession stand. It’s also popular with walkers looking for a more spirited workout and people who once used the cross-country skier but can’t find one because NordicTrack has gone out of business. The elliptical trainer is also popular among people who are bored with stair- climbing or find stair-climbing hard on their knees.\\n\\nWho will hate it Suzanne! She finds the elliptical motion unnatural. She feels that if your feet are going to be moving in a circular-type motion, you should be sitting down, like on a bike; and if you’re going to be standing, your feet should be going up and down or back and forth. But then again, Suzanne may be a poor judge of this machine — she can’t pat her head while rubbing her tummy in circles. Also, Suzanne finds it tough to read while using the elliptical trainer, and because she uses her machine cardio time to peruse the TV section of USA Today, this is a problem.\\n\\n136 Part III: Getting to the Heart of the Matter\\n\\nElliptical-trainer user tips Elliptical trainers can take a bit of getting used to, but they don’t require great skill. You’ll be up and running in no time by following these tips:\\n\\n(cid:2) Limit backward pedaling. Contrary to popular belief, pedaling back- ward does not work your buttocks more than pedaling forward (and it may even be hard on your knees). Both motions emphasize the front thigh muscles, so do it once in a while, but not for any prolonged amount of time.\\n\\n(cid:2) Use the machine’s versatile features. To adjust the intensity of your\\n\\nworkout, you can pedal faster, raise the incline, increase the resistance, or any combination.\\n\\n(cid:2) Don’t lock your knees. Keep a slight bend in your knees, keeping the\\n\\nmotion smooth.\\n\\n(cid:2) Remind yourself to stand up straight. Although the elliptical trainer lends itself to better technique than the stair-climber, you can still commit postural violations such as leaning too far forward and hugging the console.\\n\\nStationary bicycle\\n\\nBikes come in two varieties: upright and recumbent. Upright bikes simulate a regular bike, only you don’t go anywhere (see Figure 9-2). Recumbent bikes, have bucket seats so you pedal out in front of you. Neither type is superior; it’s a matter of preference. The recumbent does offer more back support and may be more comfortable for people with lower-back pain. If you’re new to exercise or heavyset, you may also find a recumbent bike more comfortable.\\n\\nWho will like it Bikes are great for toning your thighs (and recumbents are especially good for your butt), and they give your knees a break while offering a terrific aero- bic workout. Bikes also suit anyone who wants to read while working out. Holding a book or magazine in place on a stair-climber or treadmill is much tougher — and it’s impossible on a skier or rowing machine.\\n\\nWho will hate it Hard-core cyclists complain that most stationary bicycles don’t have the same feel as outdoor bikes. They’re right: The pedal positions usually are different, and the seats on a stationary bike usually are wider. Also, most indoor bikes force you to sit upright rather than allow you to lean forward, like you do on a regular bike. The exceptions are bikes specially designed for spinning and\\n\\nChapter 9: Using Cardio Machines\\n\\n137\\n\\nother versions of group indoor cycling; these contraptions are designed more like road bikes, although they lack the high-tech computer programs that keep many people motivated. Different bike brands offer very different positioning. You may like some bike brands more than others.\\n\\nFigure 9-2: An upright stationary bike.\\n\\nPhotograph by Sunstreak Productions, Inc.\\n\\nBikes give you less opportunity to use atrocious form than do most other machines. Still, there’s room for injury or discomfort. Here are some tips to help you avoid both:\\n\\n(cid:2) Adjust the seat. When the pedal is at the lowest position, your leg should be almost, but not quite, straight. You shouldn’t have to strain or rock your hips to pedal. Your knees shouldn’t feel crunched when they’re at the top of the pedal stroke. With a recumbent bike, you adjust the seat forward and back, rather than up and down, but the principles are the same.\\n\\n(cid:2) Set the handlebars correctly (if your bike allows adjustments). You\\n\\nshould be able to hold the bar so that your arms extend out at shoulder level. You shouldn’t have to squirm around to get comfortable. Handlebar adjustment is especially important if you’re very tall or very short.\\n\\n138 Part III: Getting to the Heart of the Matter\\n\\n(cid:2) Get to know the display panel. For instance, notice how many levels\\n\\nthe bike has. Some bikes feature 12 levels; others have 40. So if you just hop on and press Level 6, you’ll get two very different workouts. Also, pay attention to your cadence — that is, how many revolutions per minute (rpm) you’re cycling. Varying your cadence is a good idea. You may want to hum along at 80 rpm for 5 minutes and then do 30-second intervals at 100 rpm using the same tension level.\\n\\n(cid:2) Adjust the pedal straps so that your feet feel snug — but don’t let the straps cut off your circulation. Riding a bike with the foot straps is much more comfortable and efficient than pedaling without them. Don’t remove the pedal straps from your bike; this forces the next person to waste time putting them back on.\\n\\n(cid:2) Don’t pedal with just your toes. Otherwise you may bring on foot and calf cramps. Instead, press from the ball of your foot and through your heel as you pump downward on the pedal, and pull up with the top of your foot on the upstroke.\\n\\n(cid:2) Don’t hunch over. Rounding your back is the way to develop back and neck pain. Don’t get your upper body into the effort, either. Instead, keep your chest up, shoulders back and down, ears in line with your shoulders, and belly button drawn in. Unlike some other machines, riding a stationary bike is not a total-body workout; don’t try to make it one. If you have to rock wildly from side to side, grit your teeth, or clench the handlebars, you need to lighten your load.\\n\\n(cid:2) Make sure the bike is sturdy. At one New York City gym, a guy was ped- aling furiously when the frame collapsed and the bike shot forward and out the second story window — with the guy still seated. Ironically, he landed on a bike rack below. This being New York, the doorman said, “Hey buddy, you can’t park that thing here.” Actually, we made the last part up, but the rest of the story was reported on the news. Although the guy was hospitalized, he walked away more or less unscathed.\\n\\nWe’re not thrilled about the trend of attaching arm handles to treadmills, but we do like the so-called dual-action bikes, at least the brands that you find in health clubs. On a good bike, it’s easy to keep upper- and lower-body movements coordinated while still getting a smooth ride. Operating one of these bikes looks complicated, but it’s not nearly as difficult as, say, rubbing circles on your stomach while patting your head. We especially like the new recumbent bikes with arm handles, particularly a brand called Cycle Plus, the only such bike that allows you to adjust the arm and leg tension sepa- rately (see Figure 9-3). We’re also fond of the upright Schwinn AirDyne; the flywheel fan generates a cool, gentle breeze as you pedal your legs and pump your arms.\\n\\nChapter 9: Using Cardio Machines\\n\\n139\\n\\nFigure 9-3: A recum- bent bike with arm handles.\\n\\nPhotograph by Sunstreak Productions, Inc.\\n\\nFor bikes with arm handles, adjust the seat height as you would with a regu- lar bike, and set the arm handles at shoulder height. Coordinating upper- and lower-body motions can take some getting used to. Start by focusing on your legs and then gradually add in more arm resistance. If you find that exercising your arms and your legs at the same time is too tiring, alternate arm and leg movements until you build more stamina. As long as you keep moving, you’re still getting an aerobic workout. (For a definition of aerobic, see Chapter 8.) Keep in mind that even if you use a dual-action bike regularly, you still need to do upper-body strength training. The resistance on the bike is too low to build significant strength in your upper body.\\n\\nStair-climber\\n\\nThe most common type of stair-climber is the pedal stepper, which many exercisers refer to as the StairMaster. In fact, StairMaster is a specific brand — just one of many excellent makes that you find in health clubs and home\\n\\n140 Part III: Getting to the Heart of the Matter\\n\\nequipment stores. Stair-climbing on a machine is a big improvement over jog- ging up and down the bleachers at your local high school football stadium. The machine eliminates most of the wear and tear on your joints.\\n\\nWho will like it Women in particular love stair-climbers because these machines do a good job of toning the butt and thighs. People who want to get in shape for skiing, climbing, hiking, and running also love steppers, as they’re often called.\\n\\nThis is a good time to clear up the myth that stair-climbing builds big, bulky muscles in your legs. The truth is, virtually any type of activity will increase the size of your muscles if you work very slowly against a lot of tension. And if you have a genetic predisposition toward building muscular thighs, you’re pretty much going to fight against that no matter what you do. But for most people, this isn’t an issue. The fact is stair-climbing is a terrific way to burn calories and tone your legs.\\n\\nWho will hate it Beginners may get frustrated because stair-climbing is no vacation in Maui. If you’re a complete novice, you may not last five minutes even on the lowest level. In this case, use other machines, such as the treadmill or stationary bike, until you build up some stamina and strength. Also, stair-climbing can be tough to get the hang of; novices sometimes find themselves sinking to the floor before they’re able to get into the rhythm of stepping. Finally, stair- climbing bothers some people’s knees. If you’re one of those people but have your heart set on stair-climbing, you may be able to eliminate the pain with a solid weight-lifting program. Do exercises that strengthen your thighs, both front and back, because those are the muscles that hold your knees together.\\n\\nStair-climber user tips Proper form is butchered on the stair-climber more than on any other single piece of machinery. We’ve seen people clutch the railings so tightly their knuckles turn white — or hug the console like it’s a long-lost relative. Some less-informed exercisers think it’s really cool to be able to climb at the machine’s highest level, regardless of their form. It’s not. When you clutch the rails (or lean forward), you transfer your weight from your legs to your arms or the machine, which drastically reduces the number of calories you burn.\\n\\nFortunately, many stair-climber manufacturers have rectified this problem by designing handles that point straight up. This makes cheating more difficult. Still, we see people hanging on these newer handles. Here’s how to use this machine the right way:\\n\\nChapter 9: Using Cardio Machines\\n\\n141\\n\\n(cid:2) Rest your hands — or better yet, your fingertips — lightly on the bar in front of you or on the side rails. Don’t grip the rails any tighter than you’d grip a paper cup. And never reverse your wrists so that your fin- gertips are pointing toward the floor and your elbows are turned up to the ceiling. You really should be able to use the stair-climber without holding on to the railing at all, but using the railing for balance (within reason) is okay. If you must hang on in order to keep up with the machine, you’re going too fast. Believe us, nobody will think less of you if you drop down a few notches. In fact, you’ll probably impress people with your stellar posture and noncompetitive attitude.\\n\\n(cid:2) Stand upright with a slight forward lean at the hips (see Figure 9-4).\\n\\nDon’t overcorrect your form by standing upright like a Marine at inspec- tion. A slight — and we mean slight — forward lean helps keep your knees from locking and protects your lower back from overarching.\\n\\nFigure 9-4: Stair- climber posture: good, bad, and just as bad.\\n\\nPhotograph by Sunstreak Productions, Inc.\\n\\n(cid:2) Take even, moderately deep steps. Don’t take short, quick hopping\\n\\nsteps, a technique known as shaking the machine. This technique is hard on your calf muscles and cuts down on the number of calories you burn.\\n\\n(cid:2) Keep your entire foot on the pedal. This helps your rear end and\\n\\nthighs get a full workout and prevents you from overburdening your calf muscles.\\n\\nRolling stair-climber\\n\\nThis machine looks like a section of a department-store escalator (only it’s hardly a free ride). A set of stairs rotates in a circle so that you climb\\n\\n142 Part III: Getting to the Heart of the Matter\\n\\ncontinuously, like Sisyphus up the mountain, ever upward, but never getting anywhere. You look straight ahead into the console, which allows you to adjust the speed.\\n\\nRolling staircases have been around a lot longer than steppers. At the turn of the century, federal prisoners were forced to climb on them to provide elec- trical power to the prison facility. When modern rolling staircases first came out, there were a few kinks to work out, like the fact that they had a habit of collapsing when in use. Liz had a client who came in for a workout on her wedding day. The stairs folded underneath her and she slid to the ground, breaking an arm and a leg in the process. We’re happy to report that this defect has been fixed, and rolling staircases are as safe as any other piece of equipment in the gym, as long as you use them correctly.\\n\\nWho will like it In many ways, the rolling stair-climber is a better workout than a regular stair-climber. It’s harder to cheat, because you’re forced to take a fairly deep stride to place your foot onto the next step. (However, you can still cheat by clenching the side rails.) This machine gives you a tremendous butt and thigh workout, and you work up one helluva sweat. Start at a very slow speed until you can confidently navigate the height of the step.\\n\\nWho will hate it If you’re used to the stepper-type climbers, the rolling stair-climber takes some getting used to. Also, if you’re just getting into shape, this contraption may be a bit much for you. At some health clubs, this workout is referred to as “climbing the stairway from hell.” If you have knee or back problems, this form of exercise may not agree with you.\\n\\nRolling-stair-climber user tips The rolling stair-climber is a good machine to try when you’re looking to make stair-climbing even more challenging. We know one woman who used this machine to train for a race up the Empire State Building — 102 flights of stairs. She came in second place. Here are some tips to keep in mind (whether or not you plan to climb tall buildings):\\n\\n(cid:2) Start at a very slow speed. This is one machine you can definitely slide\\n\\noff of if you can’t maintain the pace.\\n\\n(cid:2) Start with just five or ten minutes. Even if you’re in great shape on the traditional stair-climber, treadmill, or other machine, you may find this contraption startlingly tough.\\n\\n(cid:2) Try climbing every other step. This technique gives you a killer butt\\n\\nworkout and a good stretch in your legs — but this technique is not for beginners.\\n\\nChapter 9: Using Cardio Machines\\n\\n143\\n\\nVersaClimber\\n\\nIn this case, we’re using a brand name to refer to a whole class of machines, the ladder-climbing simulator. The VersaClimber is by far the best ladder climber, and the one that you’re likely to encounter at gyms (see Figure 9-5). The VersaClimber is a stick of metal or wood that’s about 8-feet high and leans slightly forward. You step onto the foot pedals, grip the handles, and do the vertical equivalent of crawling in place. Some models have handrails so that you can omit the upper-body motion and simply move your legs in an action similar to stair-climbing. Other models have detachable seats so that you can do the upper-body motion by itself. Many VersaClimbers also have a built-in heart-rate monitor.\\n\\nFigure 9-5: This machine simulates climbing a ladder.\\n\\nPhotograph by Sunstreak Productions, Inc.\\n\\nWho will like it The VersaClimber has a reputation for being the exclusive domain of aerobic animals, but actually, it’s ideal for beginners, too. You can easily adjust the variables — step height, arm motion, speed, and tension — to customize the workout for any level. People with bad knees who like to climb may have an easier time on this machine than any other type of climber. Many athletes use this total-body trainer, and in case you care, Madonna has one.\\n\\n144 Part III: Getting to the Heart of the Matter\\n\\nWho will hate it We have a theory about why the VersaClimber isn’t more popular: People don’t like to be up high with their butts on display for the rest of the world. Some gyms put their VersaClimber off in a corner where exercisers tend to forget about it. That’s a shame because the VersaClimber is a great piece of equipment. Vanity aside, there are some good reasons to avoid it, like if you have a bad back or poor circulation in your feet.\\n\\nVersaClimber user tips Don’t be scared off by this admittedly scary-looking contraption. The VersaClimber is not as tough to operate as you think. Here’s how to look like a pro:\\n\\n(cid:2) Always warm up with small, quick strides for three to five minutes. Then experiment with different speeds, stride lengths, and tension levels. If you get tired, you can eliminate the arm movement by holding onto the handrails, or eliminate the leg movements by sitting on the seat, if there is one.\\n\\n(cid:2) Practice good climbing posture. Keep your back straight and keep your torso parallel to the machine. Don’t round your back or lean back away from the machine. Even if you take long strides, don’t stretch out your body so far that your foot hits the floor, your knees and elbows lock, or you’re forced to overarch your back.\\n\\n(cid:2) Don’t get fixated on the mileage. A vertical mile is not the same as a mile on the treadmill or the road. A mile may still be 5,280 feet (1,609 meters), but we’re talking straight uphill.\\n\\nRowing machines\\n\\nGood rowers consist of a flywheel, a fan, and a cable with a handle attached to one end (see Figure 9-6). You pull the handle toward you as you slide the seat backward. The fan creates air resistance, which makes the movement feel pretty close to skimming across the water.\\n\\nWho will like it Anyone looking for a great total-body workout will love rowing. If you’re trying to get in shape for a rowing or paddling sport, this is the way to go. Contrary to popular belief, rowing isn’t bad for your back. If you row correctly, you initiate the movement from your legs and buttocks, which eliminates excess stress on your back muscles.\\n\\nChapter 9: Using Cardio Machines\\n\\n145\\n\\nFigure 9-6: Although rowing is a demanding activity, its low-impact nature makes it a good fit for prenatal exercise.\\n\\na\\n\\nPhotograph by John Urban\\n\\nb\\n\\nWho will hate it Some people get bored with rowing in a matter of seconds. Others are intimi- dated because rowing is not as natural as walking, running, or biking. We know one guy who smacked the handle into his forehead over and over again until some kind soul in the gym showed him the proper form.\\n\\nRowing-machine user tips Experienced rowers make rowing look easy, but when you actually sit down at the machine, you may find that it takes a fair amount of coordination. Here are some tips to fine-tune the motion:\\n\\n(cid:2) Think legs, legs, legs. Concentrate on initiating the movement with your buttocks rather than your lower back. Don’t fully straighten your knees. Even when you’re completely extended, your knees should be a little soft.\\n\\n(cid:2) Don’t round your back. Hunching over is the way to give yourself back pain. Don’t lean all the way back at the end of the stroke, either. You’re in proper position when your upper body is leaning backward about 45 degrees.\\n\\n(cid:2) Pull the handle in a smooth, continuous stroke. Don’t stop at the most\\n\\nstretched-out and bent positions.\\n\\n146 Part III: Getting to the Heart of the Matter\\n\\nChapter 10 Exercising Outdoors\\n\\nIn This Chapter (cid:1) Walking or running your way to fitness (cid:1) Bicycling on a mountain bike or road bike (cid:1) Getting buff with in-line skating (cid:1) Swimming: A total-body workout (cid:1) Snowshoeing: Fitness in the great white north\\n\\nFresh air: What a concept. With all the hoopla these days about space-age,\\n\\nout in the great outdoors. You may even get a better workout — burning more calories per minute — because outdoor activities sometimes involve more muscles than their indoor counterparts. For example, when you park yourself on a stationary bicycle, your upper-body muscles basically get a free ride — you can easily read a magazine as you pedal away. But when you take your bike out for a spin, your chest, arm, abdominal, and back muscles are all called up for active duty.\\n\\nindoor exercise contraptions, it’s easy to forget you can get a great work-\\n\\nIn this chapter, we cover some of the most popular and invigorating outdoor aerobic activities. We discuss what gear you need and how much it costs, and we offer training strategies and safety tips for rookies and klutzes alike.\\n\\nWalking\\n\\nCan you really get fit by walking? Absolutely — as long as you walk long enough, hard enough, and often enough. (If you’re asking, “How long?”, “How hard?”, and “How often?”, check out Chapter 8.) A recent study found that, among people who are successful in maintaining long-term weight loss, nearly 80 percent walk as their main physical activity.\\n\\nThe beauty of walking is, it’s simply a matter of putting one foot in front of the other. Sure, walking burns fewer calories per minute than jogging, but most people last longer on a walk than a run, so you can make up for the deficit. Plus, compared to runners, walkers enjoy a relatively low injury rate.\\n\\n148 Part III: Getting to the Heart of the Matter\\n\\nHowever, we’re not going to sugar-coat this: Some exercisers find walking to be a big, fat bore. Suzanne hates walking so much that she’ll spend 15 minutes searching for a good parking space at her gym before a one-hour workout on the stationary bike. (She can’t help it; she grew up in Los Angeles, where you drive to visit your next-door neighbor.)\\n\\nEssential walking gear\\n\\nAlthough the rest of the animal kingdom does fine without the benefit of spe- cial equipment, human feet don’t have adequate padding to meet the demands of walking in the modern world. You need a good pair of walking shoes to avoid foot, ankle, knee, hip, and lower-back problems. Expect to spend at least $50 for good walking shoes, which should hold up for 1,000 to 1,500 miles. (Running shoes usually have to be tossed after 400 to 500 miles.) Replace your shoes when the tread begins to wear thin or when the sides start to cave inward or outward.\\n\\nWalking shoes may sound like a marketing conspiracy hatched by shoe- industry executives. After all, it’s only walking — won’t any pair of sneakers suffice? Actually, the concept of a walking shoe is a valid one. Walking shoes need to be more flexible than running shoes because you bend your feet more when you walk, and you push off from your toes with more oomph. Also, because your heels bear most of your weight when you walk, you need a firm, stable heel counter, the part of the shoe that wraps around your heel to keep your foot in place.\\n\\nIf you plan to hike or walk over rugged terrain, look for a walking shoe with treaded soles and added heel and ankle support. If you’re focusing on speed walking or high mileage, go for a little more cushioning in the midsole, the area between the tread and the inside of the shoe.\\n\\nWalking the right way\\n\\nOkay, we lied to you: There actually is more to walking than simply putting one foot in front of the other. The biggest mistake walkers make is bending forward, a sure way to develop problems in your lower back, neck, and hips. Your posture should be naturally tall. You needn’t force yourself to be ramrod straight, but neither should you slouch, overarch your back, or lean too far forward from your hips. Relax your shoulders, widen your chest, and pull your abdominals gently inward. Keep your head and chin up and focus straight ahead.\\n\\nMeanwhile, keep your hands relaxed and cupped gently, and swing your arms so that they brush past your body. On the upswing, your hand should be level with your breast bone; on the downswing, your hand should brush\\n\\nChapter 10: Exercising Outdoors\\n\\n149\\n\\nagainst your hip. Keep your hips loose and relaxed. Your feet should land firmly, heel first. Roll through your heel to your arch, then to the ball of your foot, and then to your toes. Push off from your toes and the ball of your foot.\\n\\nRun through a mental head-to-toe checklist every so often to see how you’re doing. To find out more about fitness walking (yep, there’s plenty more to tell), read Liz’s book Fitness Walking For Dummies (published by Wiley).\\n\\nWalking tips for rookies\\n\\nAlthough walking is the most basic of all fitness activities, novice fitness walkers can still benefit from the following pointers:\\n\\n(cid:2) Increase your workout time gradually. Most people can start off with five 10- to 20-minute walking sessions a week; after about a month, they can increase each workout by 2 or 3 minutes per week until walking 30 to 45 minutes is comfortable. (Five days a week may sound like a lot, but an almost-daily walk makes it easier to get in the habit.)\\n\\n(cid:2) Walk as fast as you comfortably can. If you walk very fast — at a\\n\\n12-minute-mile to 15-minute-mile pace — you can burn twice as many calories as when you walk at a 20-minute-mile pace. You may not be able to move at such supersonic speeds in the beginning, but as you get fit, you can mix in some fast-paced intervals. (For details about interval training, see Chapter 8.)\\n\\n(cid:2) If you’re walking on the shoulder of a road, walk against traffic so you can watch cars approach. On sidewalks or trails, walk any old way you want.\\n\\n(cid:2) Add some hills. Walking over hilly terrain shapes your butt and thighs and burns extra calories (about 30 percent more calories than walking on flat terrain, depending, of course, on the grade of the hills).\\n\\n(cid:2) Sneak in a walk whenever you can. Leave your car at home and hoof it to the train station. Take a 15-minute walk during your lunch break. Traverse the airport on foot rather than on that automatic walking belt. It all adds up.\\n\\nRunning\\n\\nLike walking, running is a workout that you can take with you anywhere. You don’t need a rack on your car or a suitcase full of equipment; you just open the door and go. Plus, as any pathological runner will tell you, nothing is quite as satisfying as getting a good run under your belt. You work up a great sweat, you burn lots of calories, and your muscles feel pleasantly invigorated after you finish.\\n\\n150 Part III: Getting to the Heart of the Matter\\n\\nNo single type of exercise is better than all the rest. It’s merely a question of what’s best for you. Many runners develop frequent, chronic injuries. Many people have joints that simply will not tolerate all that pounding. If you’re not built to run, don’t argue with your body. You can get in great condition in other ways. And if you’re a beginner, hold off on running until you’ve built up stamina and strength.\\n\\nEssential running gear\\n\\nAlthough you can spend hundreds of dollars on spiffy warm-ups, tights, and tops, the only equipment that’s truly essential for running is a good pair of shoes (although women will want a supportive jogging bra, too). Be prepared to spend at least $50 to $60 a pair, but know that a hefty price tag doesn’t always correspond to the best shoe.\\n\\nThe shoe that’s best for you depends on your weight, the shape of your foot, your running style, and any special problems you may have, such as weak ankles or bad knees. Try on several models at the store, and take each one for a test drive around the mall or at least run a couple laps around the store.\\n\\nYour running shoes should be fairly flexible, especially across the ball of the foot. Hold the shoe at both ends and bend it; it should break right at the ball of the foot. You want cushioning, but not so much that you can’t feel your foot hitting the ground. Look for a stable heel counter (the part of the shoe that wraps around your heel to keep your foot in place). If your foot slides around a lot, that can mean trouble down the road.\\n\\nRunning the right way\\n\\nRunners have a habit of looking directly at the ground, almost as if they can’t bear to see what’s coming next. Keeping your head down throws your upper- body posture off-kilter and can lead to upper-back and neck pain. Lift your head and focus your eyes straight ahead.\\n\\nRelax your shoulders, keep your chest lifted, and pull your abdominal muscles in tightly. Don’t overarch your back and stick your butt out; that’s one of the main reasons runners get back and hip pain.\\n\\nKeep your arms close to your body, and swing them forward and back rather than across your body. Don’t clench your fists. Pretend you’re holding a but- terfly in each hand; you don’t want your butterflies to escape, but you don’t want to crush them, either.\\n\\nLift your front knee and extend your back leg. Don’t shuffle along like you’re wearing cement boots. Land heel first and roll through the entire length of your foot. Push off from the balls of your feet instead of running flat-footed\\n\\nChapter 10: Exercising Outdoors\\n\\n151\\n\\nand pounding off your heels. Otherwise, your feet and legs are going to cry uncle long before your cardiovascular system does.\\n\\nIf you experience pain in your ankles, knees, or lower back, stop running for a while. If you don’t, you could end up having to sit on the sidelines for months.\\n\\nRunning tips for rookies\\n\\nThese tips help you get fit and avoid injury.\\n\\n(cid:2) Start by alternating periods of walking with periods of running. For\\n\\nexample, try two minutes of walking and one minute of running. Gradually decrease your walking intervals until you can run continuously for 20 minutes. If you have the inclination, you can build from there. Of course, sticking with a walk-run routine is fine; you’re less likely to injure your- self that way.\\n\\n(cid:2) Vary your pace. Different paces work your heart, lungs, and legs in\\n\\ndifferent ways. Experiment with the techniques described in Chapter 8.\\n\\n(cid:2) Always run against traffic when running on the shoulder of a road.\\n\\nThis allows you to see oncoming cars and dive for the side of the road, if necessary. If you’re running on steeply banked (angled away from the center line) country roads and the road is flat, you can run in the middle of the road to save wear and tear on your legs. But as you head up or down hills, get as far over on the shoulder (that is, away from the road) as possible to avoid speeding cars mowing you down. Consider carrying a lightweight cell phone for emergencies.\\n\\n(cid:2) Don’t increase your mileage by more than 10 percent a week. If you\\n\\nrun 5 miles a week and want to increase, aim to do 51⁄2 miles the following week. Jumping from 5 miles to 6 miles doesn’t sound like a big deal, but studies show that if you increase your mileage more than 10 percent, you set yourself up for injury.\\n\\nBicycling: Road and Mountain\\n\\nTalk to a group of cyclists and, chances are, you’re talking to a group of ex- runners. Cycling is perfect for people who can’t take the relentless pounding of running or find the slow pace a real drag. Cycling is the best way to cover a lot of ground quickly. Even a novice can easily build up to a 20-mile ride.\\n\\nCycling can be a hassle. You can’t just grab your shoes and head out the door. You need your helmet, water bottle, gloves, sunscreen, and glasses. And even with all your protective gear, you can never be too cautious. Cycling is a low- impact sport — unless you happen to impact the ground, a car, a tree, a rut, or another cyclist.\\n\\n152 Part III: Getting to the Heart of the Matter\\n\\nEssential cycling gear\\n\\nIf you haven’t owned a bike since grammar school, prepare yourself for sticker shock. Mountain bikes, the fat-tire bikes with upright handlebars, are somewhat less expensive than comparable road bikes, the kind with the curved handle- bars. In both categories, you won’t find many decent bikes under $500; many cost more than $2,000. Don’t take out a second mortgage to buy a fancy bike, but if you have any inkling that you may like this sport, don’t skimp, either. You’ll just end up buying a more expensive bike later.\\n\\nWhat distinguishes a $500 bike from a $2,000 steed? Generally, the more expensive the bike, the stronger and lighter its frame. A heavy bike can slow you down, but unless you plan to enter the Tour de France, don’t get hung up on a matter of ounces. Cheaper bikes are made from different grades of steel; as you climb the price ladder, you find materials such as aluminum, carbon fiber, and titanium. The price of a bike also depends on the quality of the components — the mechanics that enable your bike to move, shift, and brake.\\n\\nCheaper bikes come with toe clips (pedal straps) that enable you to pull up on the pedal as well as push down. But you can pull up even more efficiently with clipless pedals, which lock into cleats affixed to the bottom of your cycling shoes. These pedal systems are like ski bindings: You’re locked in, but your feet pop out easily when you fall. To clip out, you simply twist your foot to the side.\\n\\nBeginners usually have an accident or two with clipless pedals because they haven’t developed the instinct to twist sideways. Suzanne once tipped over with both feet clicked into her pedals. We’ll spare you the details of her injury, but let’s just say that she ended up at the gynecologist.\\n\\nFind a bike dealer you trust and know that bike prices are negotiable. Ask the salesman to throw in a few free extras, like a bike computer to measure your speed and distance or a seat bag to carry food and tools.\\n\\nDon’t even think about pedaling down your driveway without a helmet snug atop your noggin. Cycling gloves make your ride more comfortable and protect your hands when you crash. Glasses are important to protect your eyes from the dust, dirt, and gravel.\\n\\nBuy a pair of padded cycling shorts and a brightly colored cycling jersey so that you can easily be seen. Unlike cotton t-shirts, jerseys wick away sweat so that you won’t freeze on a downhill after you worked up a big sweat climb- ing up. Plus, jerseys have pockets in the back deep enough to hold half a gro- cery store worth of snacks. Always carry a water bottle or wear a hydration pack, a clever backpack-like water pouch that we describe in Chapter 25.\\n\\nChapter 10: Exercising Outdoors\\n\\n153\\n\\nFinally, carry gear to change a flat tire, and learn how to use it. There’s no cycling equivalent of the auto club to come save you.\\n\\nCycling the right way\\n\\nTo protect your knees from injury, position your seat correctly (ask your salesperson for advice) and pedal at an easy cadence. Cadence refers to the number of revolutions per minute that you pedal. Inexperienced cyclists tend to use a higher gear than they can handle, which forces them to turn the pedals in slow motion; their legs tire prematurely, their knees ache, and they cheat themselves out of a good workout. Set your bike’s gear so you’re pedaling at a comfortable cadence.\\n\\nRoad cycling can wreak havoc on your lower back because you’re in a crouched position for so long. Relax your upper body and keep your arms loose. Grasp your handlebars with the same tension that you’d hold a child’s hand when you cross the street. Pedal in smooth circles rather than simply mashing the pedals downward. Imagine that you have a bed of nails in your shoes, and you have to pedal without stomping on the nails.\\n\\nCycling tips for rookies\\n\\nYou can learn a lot about cycling — and get faster in a jif — by riding with a club or friends who have more experience. Here are some pointers to start your cycling career:\\n\\n(cid:2) Remember that you are a vehicle and are required to follow the rules\\n\\nof the road. Ride with traffic, not against it.\\n\\n(cid:2) Stop at all signs and lights, and use those hand signals you learned in driver’s ed. Don’t trust a single car, ever. Assume that the driver doesn’t see you, even if he happens to be staring you in the face.\\n\\n(cid:2) When you go off-road, start on wide fire roads rather than narrow\\n\\n“single-track” trails that require technical skills. And don’t think that you’re immune to injury because there are no cars. More crashes happen on mountain trails than on the road because there are more obstacles and riders get careless and cocky.\\n\\n(cid:2) Head into a turn at a slow enough pace that you maintain control, and never let your eyes wander from the road or trail. Never squeeze the brakes — particularly the front brake — with a lot of pressure. You’ll go flying over the handlebars, a maneuver known as an endo, and go right into a face plant, a maneuver that we think is self-explanatory.\\n\\n154 Part III: Getting to the Heart of the Matter\\n\\nIn-Line Skating\\n\\nIn 1980, Rollerblade introduced a new kind of skate: Instead of two wheels at the toe and two wheels at the heel, the four wheels were positioned in a single-file line. This was the biggest innovation in skating since a 16th-century Dutchman patterned the first pair of roller skates after ice skates. Now in-line skating — often called Rollerblading — is the skate of choice for more than 15 million people.\\n\\nSkating is fun because it isn’t as linear as running, walking, and cycling. You can curve, turn, glide, sprint, and spin. Skating is also a terrific tush toner because you push your legs out to the side, which works several seldom-used hip muscles. Skating is a good calorie burner, too.\\n\\nBut in-line skating is also dangerous. About 270,000 skaters per year wind up at the doctor or emergency room with injuries. Liz got a first-hand look at one of these injuries not long ago. While running over the 59th Street Bridge in New York City, Liz spotted a woman walking in bare feet and sobbing. The woman’s entire left side was so bloody that she appeared to have been mauled by a tiger. It turns out the woman had attempted to skate over sharp metal teeth on the road — teeth designed to provide traction for cars during icy conditions in winter.\\n\\nMost skaters use more common sense than that, but injuries are still common because the sport requires so much balance and concentration. Plus, stopping on in-line skates is darn tough. (See “Skating the right way,” later in this chapter, for stopping tips.)\\n\\nEssential skating gear\\n\\nSkating equipment isn’t cheap — a good pair of skates costs between $150 and $500. (We suggest you rent several times before you buy.) Try on several pairs at the store and wear each for at least ten minutes, until your feet start to get hot. Tilt your feet to the inside and the outside, putting plenty of pres- sure on your feet to make sure nothing hurts. Otherwise, you’re asking for blisters. The boots should feel snug in the toe and heel. If your heel is loose, you won’t have enough control when you skate.\\n\\nIn-line skates have more on conventional roller skates than just wheel place- ment. The wheels are faster, smoother, and more durable. Most skates have a plastic shell and foam-lined bootie, so they breathe more easily and conform to your feet much better than leather skates. You typically can get a more comfortable fit with skates that buckle rather than lace. Be sure to wear syn- thetic socks; cotton fibers retain moisture, which can irritate your feet. (See Chapter 25 for details about sports socks.)\\n\\nChapter 10: Exercising Outdoors\\n\\n155\\n\\nBy the way, we don’t recommend that novices try off-road skates, which have fat, nubby wheels similar to mountain-bike tires. Skating is dangerous enough; we can’t see a reason to do it over gravel and tree roots. We do, however, like skates with wheels that pop off, leaving you with decent walking boots. Because many buildings ban skates, removable wheels are a nice convenience.\\n\\nA helmet is as essential for skating as it is for biking. A cycling helmet will suffice, but you can buy special in-line helmets with more protection at the rear of the head. Also crucial: wrist guards, knee guards, and elbow guards. Purchase safety equipment before you buy your skates so you won’t be tempted to take a quick spin before suiting up.\\n\\nSkating the right way\\n\\nKeep your hands in front of your body at all times with your elbows in, your forearms straight ahead, and your palms down, as if you’re placing your hands on a table. If you move your hands off center, your body is likely to follow. Keep your arms as still as possible — don’t pump them back and forth.\\n\\nTravel in a modified squat position, bending at the knees as if you’re about to sit down. Keep your weight on your back wheel and push off straight with your heel. Pull your abdominal muscles inward and don’t round your back. If you start to lose your balance, crouch lower — don’t stand up straighter. If you veer off the pavement and onto mud or grass, run on your skates instead of stopping cold.\\n\\nSkating tips for rookies\\n\\nTo find out whether skating is the sport for you, take a few lessons. (You can find an instructor through a skate shop, or call the International In-Line Skating Association for a referral.) In the meantime, here are some suggestions to get started:\\n\\n(cid:2) Practice balancing by walking on the skates on your living-room carpet or your lawn. Head to a parking lot to practice skating, turning, and stopping. Stick to bike paths until you’re quite comfortable skating, and when you do head for the open road, always skate with — not against — traffic. Remember: You’re responsible for abiding by the same rules as motorists.\\n\\n(cid:2) Don’t expect brakes to bring you to a complete halt. The best a novice can hope to do is slow down. To do this, simultaneously lean forward from your waist, tilt the braking skate up, and exert pressure on the heel pad while maintaining your balance. Skip hills until you master stopping, and always skate slowly enough that you feel as though you could stop at any time.\\n\\n156 Part III: Getting to the Heart of the Matter\\n\\n(cid:2) Don’t skate on the side of a busy road, where a cyclist might ride.\\n\\nStick to bike trails, sidewalks, and other smooth, well-maintained, no- traffic areas.\\n\\n(cid:2) Don’t skate while holding anything in your hand, even a can of soda. When you fall, your reflex is to save what you’re holding, not to protect your body.\\n\\nSwimming\\n\\nSwimming is truly a zero-impact sport. Although you can strain your shoul- ders if you overdo it, there’s absolutely no pounding on your joints, and the only thing you’re in danger of crashing into is the wall of the pool. You can get a great aerobic workout that uses your whole body. Plus, water has a gentle, soothing effect on the body, so swimming is helpful for those with arthritis or other joint diseases.\\n\\nSwimming is great for people who want to keep exercising when they’re injured and for people who are pregnant or overweight. That extra body fat helps you glide along near the surface of the water, so you don’t expend energy trying to keep yourself from sinking like a stone.\\n\\nLap swimming has the reputation of being drudgery — after all, the scenery doesn’t change a whole lot from one end of the pool to the other. The trick is to use an array of gadgets that elevate swim workouts from forced labor to bona fide fun. You can even buy an underwater tape player with pretty decent sound.\\n\\nEssential swimming gear\\n\\nObviously, a body of water is helpful — preferably one manned by a lifeguard. And in most instances, you must wear a swimsuit. By the way, we said swim- suit, not bathing suit. You don’t want a suit that looks good while you’re sun- bathing but creeps up your butt when you get in the water.\\n\\nIf you swim in a chlorinated pool, goggles are a must to prevent eye irritation and to help you see better in the water. Buy goggles from a store that lets you try them on. You should feel some suction around your eyes, but not so much that you feel like your eyeballs are going to pop out. You also need a cap so that your hair doesn’t get plastered on your face as you swim or turn to straw from the chemicals.\\n\\nAs for the fun swimming gadgets: Many pools let you borrow equipment, but you can buy a whole set for less than $75. We especially like rubber swim- ming fins which give you a lot more speed and power in the water and give\\n\\nChapter 10: Exercising Outdoors\\n\\n157\\n\\nyour legs a better workout. If you’re a beginning swimmer, you may feel like you’re going nowhere, and you may have trouble moving fast enough to get your heart rate up.\\n\\nYou can use fins when you kick with a kickboard, a foam board that helps you stay afloat. But don’t use fins so much that they become a crutch. As you get in better shape, you may want to switch from long swim fins to short fins, which make you work a lot harder. Don’t swim with scuba fins; they’re too big and too stiff.\\n\\nSwimming with plastic paddles on your hands gives your upper body an extra challenge. Some paddles are flat and rectangular; others are shaped more like your hand, with a comfortable contour in the palm area. With both styles, you place your hand on top of the paddles and slip your fingers through a thick rubber band that secures your hand to the paddles. Paddles can help you perfect your stroke technique and increase the intensity of your workout, but use them sparingly; overuse can lead to shoulder injuries. When you swim with paddles, put a pull-buoy (a foam gadget) between your thighs. This keeps your legs buoyant so that you can concentrate on paddling rather than kicking.\\n\\nSwimming the right way\\n\\nYou’ll probably spend the bulk of your workouts doing the front crawl, also called freestyle. It’s generally faster than the other strokes, so you can cover more distance. Don’t cut your strokes short; reach out as far as you can, have your hand enter thumb-first so it slices the water like a knife, and pull all the way through the water so your hand brushes your thigh. Use an S-shaped sculling movement, where you hand moves out, then in, then out again across your body/thigh and out of the water. Elongate your stroke so that you take fewer than 25 strokes in a 25-yard pool. The fewer strokes, the better. Top swimmers get so much power from each stroke that they take just 11 to 14 strokes per length of a 25-yard pool.\\n\\nKick up and down from your hips, not your knees. Don’t kick too deeply or allow your feet to break the water’s surface. Proper kicking causes the water to “boil” rather than splash.\\n\\nBreathe through your mouth every two strokes, or every three strokes if you want to alternate the side that you breathe on. You need as much oxygen as you can get. Beginners sometimes make the mistake of taking six or eight strokes before breathing, which wears them out quickly. To breathe, roll your entire body to the side until your mouth and nose come out of the water — imagine that your entire body is on a skewer and must rotate together. Don’t lift your head out of the water to breathe — you’ll spend a lot of energy doing that, and it’ll slow you down in the water.\\n\\n158 Part III: Getting to the Heart of the Matter\\n\\nSwimming tips for rookies\\n\\nEven if you’re the queen of your aerobics class or a champion at cycling uphill, you may still tire quickly in the pool at first. More than almost any other aerobic activity, swimming relies on technique. The following tips can help you get the most out of your swimming workouts.\\n\\n(cid:2) Take a few lessons if you haven’t swum in a while. Beginners waste a lot of energy flailing and splashing around rather than moving forward. (cid:2) Break your workout into intervals. For example, don’t just get into the pool, swim 20 laps, and get out. Instead, do 4 easy laps for a warm-up. Then do 8 sets of 2 laps at a faster pace, resting 20 seconds between sets. Then cool down with two easy laps, and maybe a few extra laps with a kickboard. Mix up your strokes, too. The four basic strokes — freestyle, backstroke, breaststroke, and butterfly — use your muscles in different ways.\\n\\n(cid:2) If swimming is your bag, join a Masters swim club. These clubs, located at university and community pools nationwide, are geared toward adult swimmers of all levels. A coach gives you a different workout every time you swim and monitors your progress. Best of all, you have buddies to work out with. Don’t worry about being slow; the coach will group you in a lane with other people your speed. If you have a competitive spirit, you can compete in Masters meets, where you swim against others who are roughly your speed.\\n\\n(cid:2) If you find swimming a big yawn but enjoy being in the water, try\\n\\nwater running or water aerobics. Water running is a pretty tough work- out because the water provides resistance from all directions as you move your legs. It’s an excellent workout for injur0ed runners because, even though it’s nonimpact and easy on your joints, it helps maintain aerobic conditioning. Don’t assume that water aerobics is for little old ladies in flowered caps. With the right instructor and exercise program, you can get a challenging water-aerobics workout. Water running can be even tougher.\\n\\nSnowshoeing\\n\\nSuzanne loves the snow but hates downhill skiing. She doesn’t understand the point of standing in line for 45 minutes while icy wind whips through your $400 parka — all so you can whoosh down the mountain in three minutes, stand in line, and risk frostbite all over again. Plus, she’s a klutz, so she navigates moguls with her skis pointed in that dorky V-shaped position.\\n\\nChapter 10: Exercising Outdoors\\n\\n159\\n\\nFor these reasons, Suzanne was thrilled to discover snowshoeing — now her favorite winter sport and one that’s booming in popularity nationwide. Snowshoeing takes you into the woods and away from the crowds, burns lots of calories, and generates enough body heat to keep you toasty. Plus, it involves minimal spending, no risk of injury, and, best of all, no skill. Snowshoeing has become so popular that 5K and 10K competitions have sprung up nationwide.\\n\\nEssential snowshoeing gear\\n\\nThe term snowshoeing may conjure up images of bearded Scandinavian trap- pers slogging across the tundra, their boots strapped to giant wooden tennis racquets. Indeed, that’s what snowshoeing was all about — a thousand years ago. Unlike the old 7-foot-long wood-and-cowhide shoes, today’s snowshoes are just 2 feet long, and the oblong frames are made of lightweight aluminum. High-tech fabric stretches across the frame, providing a surface area that keeps you from sinking into the snow. (By the way, snowshoes don’t directly fit on your bare feet; you strap the snowshoes onto any footwear that’s comfortable for you — walking shoes, running shoes, or even lightweight hiking boots.)\\n\\nSnowshoes run between $120 and $300, and they come in different sizes (heavier people need larger frames) and designs (for casual walking, back- country hiking, and running on packed snow). Before you make an investment, rent them at a ski shop for $10 to $20. Rent poles, too. They help propel you uphill and help you maintain balance going downhill, and you can decide whether you like them enough to invest in a pair for yourself. (Poles cost from $60 to $140 per pair.)\\n\\nBe sure to dress in layers. Even in freezing temperatures, you can work up a good sweat and then get chilly fast. Wear a lightweight, breathable top that wicks away sweat. On top of that, wear a fleece pullover or vest. On super- cold days, bring a lightweight, water-resistant jacket. (You’ll suffocate in a ski parka.)\\n\\nSnowshoeing the right way\\n\\nIf you can walk, you can snowshoe. Suzanne did manage to fall on her face her first day on snowshoes, but that’s because she forgot she was wearing them; her stride was too short, and she stepped onto her own snowshoe and tripped. But after you grasp the fact that snowshoes are longer than hiking boots, you’re set.\\n\\n160 Part III: Getting to the Heart of the Matter\\n\\nStill a few handy techniques can help you navigate hilly terrain. When you climb a steep slope, kick the front of your snowshoe into the snow and stomp down to compact the fluffy stuff. To avoid slipping, make sure that each new step is distinct from the previous one. When snowshoeing downhill, keep your knees slightly bent and lean back a bit so your weight is on your heel cleats.\\n\\nSnowshoeing tips for rookies\\n\\nConsider these tips before you head out the door:\\n\\n(cid:2) Start on packed snow. Tromping through fluffy powder can leave you breathless — it’s like heading away from the firm, wet shoreline and slogging through deep, dry sand. The deeper the snow and the steeper the terrain, the more exhausted you’ll feel.\\n\\n(cid:2) When you’re in powder, go single-file, alternating positions to share the burden of breaking trail (snowshoeing-speak for being the first person to make a trail through fresh snow). You may find that you have to take frequent breaks while snowshoeing in powder, because your heart rate is likely to elevate rapidly.\\n\\n(cid:2) Because snowshoeing is taxing and the air at high altitudes is dry, you need to drink plenty of water. Wear a fanny pack with a water-bottle holster or strap on a hydration pack designed for winter sports.\\n\\nPart IV Lift and Curl: Building a Stronger Bod with Weights\\n\\nIn this part . . . We give you the know-how to tone and strengthen\\n\\nthe gym. Chapter 11 gives you five great reasons to lift weights and answers important questions, like: “What if I want to get muscle definition like Buffy the Vampire Slayer or LaBron James?” In Chapter 12, we cover your major muscle groups so that you know your lats from your pecs from your delts. In Chapter 13, we explain the differ- ences between barbells, dumbbells, and weight machines and help you choose the best equipment for you. Chapter 14 helps you get started on a weight-training program. We discuss how much weight to lift, how many exercises to do, and how to use good form so you don’t get injured. We also demonstrate a complete weight-training workout that you can perform either at a health club or at home.\\n\\nyour muscles, whether you work out at home or at\\n\\nChapter 11 Why You’ve Gotta Lift Weights\\n\\nIn This Chapter (cid:1) Understanding five major reasons to lift weights (cid:1) Busting some weight-lifting myths (cid:1) Assessing your chances of looking like Jackie Chan or Demi Moore\\n\\nyou suspect that the size of one’s muscles is inversely proportional to the size of one’s brain. Maybe when you see a hulking guy on the street, you think, “He may be able to bench-press my minivan, but I can read a menu in French.”\\n\\nMaybe you’ve never considered yourself the weight-lifting type. Maybe\\n\\nThe truth is, weight lifting is an incredibly smart thing to do. It’s not just a form of narcissism, and it’s not just for body builders. Heck, these days, even 80-year-olds are pumping iron. In this chapter, we explain why you should, too. We also dispel popular weight-training myths and tell you what kind of results you can reasonably expect. If you think lifting weight seems too boring, too dangerous, too troublesome, or too likely to transform you into Hulk Hogan, we hope this chapter changes your mind.\\n\\nFirst, a quick note: Throughout this book, we use the terms weight lifting, weight training, and strength training interchangeably, even though you don’t necessarily need weight to build strength. Resistance training means the same thing, but we spare you that bit of verbiage.\\n\\nFive Important Reasons to Pick Up a Dumbbell\\n\\nPeople who start lifting weights regularly will tell you how much more fit, powerful, and energetic they feel . . . but enough about feelings. There’s plenty of good, solid evidence that strength training does all that and more. We bet that at least one of the following reasons will get you to hoist some iron.\\n\\n164 Part IV: Lift and Curl: Building a Stronger Bod with Weights\\n\\nStay strong for everyday life\\n\\nPeople who don’t exercise lose 30 to 40 percent of their strength by age 65. By age 74, more than one-fourth of American men and two-thirds of American women can’t lift an object heavier than 10 pounds, like a small dog or a loaded garbage bag. These changes aren’t the normal consequences of aging. They’re a result of neglect — of experiencing life from a La-Z-Boy recliner and the front seat of a Winnebago. If you don’t use your muscles, they simply waste away. This gradual slide toward wimpiness can begin as early as your mid-20s.\\n\\nFortunately, strength is one of the easiest physical abilities to retain as you get older; certainly, you can do a lot more to halt strength loss than you can to pre- vent wrinkling skin, fading eyesight, or increasing affection for elevator Muzak. One study, which included men up to age 96, found that by lifting weight, most seniors can at least double — if not triple — their muscle power.\\n\\nSo if you rarely lift anything heavier than a cell phone, it’s time to build enough brawn to get along in the real world. Increased strength is what you need to unscrew the top off a stubborn jar of pickles, hoist your kid onto the mechani- cal horsy, and close a suitcase that’s too full. Even if you have the stamina to sprint the full length of an airport to catch your plane, it’s not going to do you much good if you can’t lug along that overstuffed luggage.\\n\\nKeep your bones healthy\\n\\nTwenty-five million Americans have osteoporosis, a disease of severe bone loss that causes 1.5 million fractures a year, mostly of the back, hip, and wrist. About half of those who break their hips never regain full walking ability, and many of these fractures lead to fatal complications. When bones become extremely weak — picture them like chalk, porous and fragile — it doesn’t even take a fall to break them. Someone with osteoporosis doesn’t fall and break a hip; she breaks a hip and falls.\\n\\nOsteoporosis isn’t something that happens to you overnight, like becoming eligible for a senior discount at the movies. Most people start out with strong, dense bones — imagine them as poles of steel. But around age 35, most people — men included — begin to lose about 1⁄2 to 1 percent of their bone each year. (For women, bone loss accelerates after menopause — 1 to 2 per- cent a year for the first five years and then about 1 percent annually until age 70. Then the loss slows back to 1⁄2 percent a year.) If you do everything right, however, you can decelerate this bone loss significantly — by about 50 per- cent. If you’ve already lost a lot of bone, you may even be able to build some of it back. Strength training alone can’t stop bone loss, but it can play a big role. Also important are calcium, vitamin D, and aerobic exercise such as walk- ing and jogging. (Swimming and cycling don’t work because your body weight is supported, either by the water or the bike; when you have to support your own self, your bones respond by building themselves up.)\\n\\nChapter 11: Why You’ve Gotta Lift Weights\\n\\n165\\n\\nStrong muscles and strong bones go hand in hand. The more weight you can lift, the more stress you can put on your bones; this stress is what stimulates them. The first astronauts to spend time in space experienced significant bone-density loss. In space, not only does no one hear you scream, but you’re weightless — there’s no load placed on your muscles and bones. Today’s astronauts prevent bone loss by exercising several hours a day.\\n\\nPrevent injuries\\n\\nWhen your muscles are strong, you’re less injury-prone. You’re less likely to step off a curb and twist your ankle. Plus, you have a better sense of balance and surefootedness, so you’re less apt to take a tumble during a weekend game of touch football. Research shows that one out of every three people over age 65 falls at least once a year. Almost 10 percent of older people who fall are hospitalized for an injury, and about half of those cases involve broken bones.\\n\\nLook better\\n\\nNow let’s talk about pure, unadulterated vanity. Aerobic exercise burns lots of calories, but weight lifting firms, lifts, builds, and shapes your muscles. A marathon runner may be able to go the distance, but he won’t turn any heads on the beach if he has a concave chest and string-bean arms. (He might also be a faster runner if he pumped up a bit.)\\n\\nWe want to be clear here: There’s no such thing as spot reducing — that is, selectively zapping fat off a particular part of your body. But you can pick certain areas, such as your butt or your arms, and reshape them through weight training. And if you have wide hips or a thick middle, you can bring your body more into proportion by doing exercises that broaden your shoul- ders and back.\\n\\nWeight training also makes you look better by improving your posture. With strong abdominal and lower-back muscles, you stand up straighter and look more svelte even if you haven’t lost an ounce.\\n\\nSpeed up your metabolism\\n\\nMetabolism is all over the news these days. At gyms, health-food stores, and juice bars, you can buy pills, powders, and “thermogenic herbs” touted to rev up your metabolism (and thereby help you burn extra calories without trying). Suzanne’s own parents, despite their daughter’s eye-rolling and sarcastic snorts, even tried a meat-and-grapefruit diet purported to boost metabolism. All these claims are bogus. The only way to increase your metabolism is to build muscle, which you can best accomplish by lifting weights.\\n\\n166 Part IV: Lift and Curl: Building a Stronger Bod with Weights\\n\\nHow does this work? First, a couple of definitions: Your metabolism refers to the number of calories you’re burning at any given moment, whether you’re watching The Weather Channel or riding a bike. But when most people use the term, they’re referring to your resting metabolism, the number of calories your body needs to maintain its vital functions. Your brain, heart, kidneys, and other organs are cranking away 24 hours a day, and your muscle cells are constantly undergoing repair. All these processes require energy in the form of calories simply to keep you alive.\\n\\nBut here’s the key: Your resting metabolic rate depends primarily on your amount of fat-free mass — everything in your body that’s not fat, including muscle, bones, blood, organs, and tissue. The more fat-free mass you have, the more energy your body expends in order to keep going. So, you want to be muscular. You can’t do anything to increase the size of your liver or brain, but you certainly can make yourself more muscular, and lifting weights is the primary way to do just that.\\n\\nKeep in mind, however, that packing on a few more pounds of muscle isn’t going to turn your body into a calorie-burning inferno. For every 1 pound of muscle you gain, your body may burn an extra 30 to 50 calories per day. That’s not a lot, especially if you compensate by eating one extra Hershey’s Kiss (24 calories) per day. However, in the long run, even that small meta- bolic boost can be significant. If you burn an extra 25 calories per day, you can burn 9,125 calories in a year — enough to lose nearly 3 pounds, or at least prevent a 3-pound weight gain. And if you add 10 pounds of lean muscle, you can burn an additional 300 to 500 calories per day!\\n\\nIf that’s not impressive, consider the flip side: If you don’t lift weights, your metabolism will slow down every year, as your muscles slowly waste away. And with a more sluggish metabolic rate, you’ll gain weight even if you eat the same amount of food. How’s that for incentive to hit the weight room?\\n\\nOne final point: The metabolism-boosting benefits of weight lifting are par- ticularly important if you’re cutting calories to lose weight. Dieting alone tends to cause a loss in muscle as well as fat; if you lift weights while cutting back on your calorie intake, you can preserve muscle — and maintain your metabolism — while losing fat.\\n\\nBuilding Muscle: Myths and Reality\\n\\nThere sure are a lot of misconceptions about weight training. Many people have no idea what changes to expect when they begin lifting weights, so they ask some not-so-dumb questions, like the ones that follow.\\n\\nChapter 11: Why You’ve Gotta Lift Weights\\n\\n167\\n\\nHow long does it take to get stronger?\\n\\nYou may be able to lift more weight after just one weight-lifting workout. This isn’t because you’ve built up more muscle; it’s mainly because your weight- training skills have improved. The first time you try the bench press, you waste a lot of energy trying to balance the bar, keep it steady, and move it in a straight line. But after you get the hang of the process — typically after one weight-lifting session — you’re able to put all your energy into lifting the weight.\\n\\nAnother reason you develop strength after just a few weeks of working out is that, in a sense, your muscles have memory. Your nerves, the pathways that link your brain and muscles, learn how to carry information more quickly — much like the speed-dial feature on your telephone. So after learning an exer- cise, your brain tells your muscles, “You know what this is. Go for it.”\\n\\nDuring the first six to eight weeks you lift weight, most of the strength you gain is due to skill and muscle memory. After that time, your muscles begin to grow. In other words, the sizes of your muscle fibers increase — you don’t actually grow more muscle cells. Realize that some muscles gain strength faster than others do. In general, large muscles, like your chest and back muscles, grow faster than smaller ones, like your arm and shoulder muscles. Most people can increase their strength between 7 and 40 percent after about ten weeks of train- ing each muscle group twice a week.\\n\\nDo some people have greater strength potential than others?\\n\\nHow much muscle power you develop depends on many things, including your age, sex, and body type (and, of course, your diligence). Seniors gen- erally can’t develop as much strength as young people, but it’s not clear whether this is due to the normal aging process or years of inactivity. However, look at Jack La Lanne, who worked out all his life. For his 80th birthday, he towed a rowboat across a river with his teeth. Men typically have the capacity for greater overall strength than women do because their bodies have a higher proportion of muscle and more of the strength hormone testosterone.\\n\\nEvery body type has a different capacity for building strength and muscle. All the training in the world won’t change your body type. If you start out short and narrow, weight training won’t miraculously make you tall and broad. Weight training may, however, make you a more fit, muscular version of short and narrow.\\n\\n168 Part IV: Lift and Curl: Building a Stronger Bod with Weights\\n\\nStrength is one thing, but how long will it take before my body looks better?\\n\\nMost people start to see changes after six weeks of weight lifting, but we can’t give you an exact answer. Results depend on your body type, your starting point, and the amount of time and effort you devote to lifting weight. In general, those who have the furthest to go make the most dramatic changes.\\n\\nEveryone notices the biggest improvements in the muscles that they use the least. The triceps (the muscles at the rear of your upper arm; see Chapter 12) are a classic example: You don’t use them much in everyday life, so when you start targeting them with weight they become firmer fairly fast. The same goes for shoulders. Most people don’t tend to carry much fat on their shoulders, so shoulders shape and tone relatively quickly.\\n\\nWhat if I want to get muscle definition like Demi Moore or Jackie Chan?\\n\\nLifting weight diligently will help shape your body, but you’ll never see muscle definition if you have a thick layer of fat covering your muscles. Muscle defini- tion means that you have so little body fat that you can see the outline of your muscles. You begin to see a hint of definition when your body fat dips into the 20 percent to 22 percent range. At around 18 percent, muscle definition is really apparent. Below 15 percent, you develop an appearance that body builders reverentially refer to as ripped. (We tell you all about body fat in Chapter 2.) We’re not recommending that you try to get down this low, because it can be dangerously unhealthy; we do, however, want you to be aware that the buff, ripped look doesn’t happen for most people. Also, keep in mind that you can still look firm, fit, and sexy even if you aren’t ripped to shreds.\\n\\nWill weight lifting turn me into a WWE contender?\\n\\nNo. About 99 percent of women — and a significant percentage of men — can’t develop huge muscles without spending hours a day in the gym lifting some serious poundage. Even then, most women don’t have testosterone to add major bulk to their frames unless they take steroids — in which case, they may also end up with acne, a beard, liver cancer, uterus shrinkage, and a voice like Darth Vader’s. Just the look you’re going for, right?\\n\\nLifting may actually make you smaller. Because muscle is a very compact, dense tissue, it takes up less room than fat. At first, you may not lose any\\n\\nChapter 11: Why You’ve Gotta Lift Weights\\n\\n169\\n\\nweight. You may even gain a few pounds, because muscle weighs more per square inch than fat, but your clothes may fit better. As we explain in Chapter 2, that number on your bathroom scale is an incomplete number.\\n\\nBut what if I want to increase bulk?\\n\\nDeveloping huge muscles is difficult for people with certain body types, and usually comes only with a high-calories diet mixed with intensive, consistent training. If you’re lean and wiry to begin with, you’ll probably add definition but not much size. The people most likely to build up their frames are those who have a muscular body type even before they start lifting.\\n\\nTo bulk up without risking the dangers of steroids, many athletes and recre- ational exercisers are turning to creatine, the apparently more benign sub- stance that was touted by baseball’s homerun king Mark McGwire. Some research shows that creatine may indeed make you bigger and stronger; however, the research isn’t conclusive, and no one has studied the substance long enough to know if there are long-term side-effects. We also advise against taking androstenedione — also known as andro — another muscle-building aid that McGwire used. Evidence suggests that andro lowers levels of HDL choles- terol, the good kind, increasing the risk for heart disease, and it’s now banned by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration.\\n\\nApparently, an increasing number of men are harboring unrealistic expecta- tions about their potential to get huge. A few years ago, a Harvard psychiatrist came up with an interesting theory to explain why: outlandishly muscular toys. Over the last 30 years, G.I. Joe action figures have inflated into hulks with physiques that even top bodybuilders can’t attain. The professor mea- sured the waist, chest, and biceps of the action figures and then adjusted the numbers for a 6-foot man. In 1964, G.I. Joe had 12.2-inch biceps; ten years later his “guns” had grown to 15.2 inches. By 1998, G.I. Joe’s biceps measured a whopping 26.8 inches — nearly 7 inches larger than Mark McGwire’s. For decades, Barbie — with her impossibly small waist and huge chest — has created unrealistic expectations for women and girls; now, it seems that G.I. Joe is doing the same sort of damage in boys and men.\\n\\nIf I stop lifting weight, won’t my muscle turn to fat?\\n\\nOnly if silver can be transformed into gold. Fat and muscle are two distinctly different substances. When you look at them under the microscope, fat looks like chicken wire, and muscle looks like frayed electrical wiring. If you stop lifting weight, your muscles simply atrophy, a fancy word for shrink. The main\\n\\n170 Part IV: Lift and Curl: Building a Stronger Bod with Weights\\n\\nreason people may gain fat when they stop lifting weights is that they keep their calorie intake the same but are no longer burning as many calories throughout the day. Those extra calories are stored as fat.\\n\\nShould I lose weight before I start lifting weights?\\n\\nActually, no. Start weight training right away. Weight training can speed up your metabolism and give you more muscle tone, better posture, and better body proportions. In addition, lifting weight enhances your aerobic efforts. With stronger muscles, you have more staying power on the stair-climber, and you’re less apt to have a setback due to injury from your aerobic work- outs. For example, you may be working out like gangbusters when, suddenly, you feel a little twinge in your knee. You lay off for a couple days, which turns into a couple years. You may be able to prevent this whole incident by strengthening your knees. Plus, adding weight training to your new exercise program gives you more variety and helps keep you motivated.\\n\\nChapter 12 Your Muscles: Love ’Em or Lose ’Em\\n\\nIn This Chapter (cid:1) Discovering the formal names — and the slang — of your muscles (cid:1) Looking at nifty muscle illustrations (cid:1) Finding out our favorite exercises for each muscle\\n\\nThere are 650 muscles in your body.

Consider, for example, the inferior retinac-\\n\\nMeanwhile, in this chapter, we tell you about the 20 or so muscles that any conscientious exerciser should know. What’s the point? For one thing, you won’t need an interpreter when a trainer, video instructor, or fellow gym member says, “Let’s do lats and pecs today.” Before you know it, you may be saying stuff like that, too. And you’ll sound really impressive — like wine afi- cionados who say, “This chardonnay has a superior bouquet.”\\n\\nBut more importantly, if you can name your major muscles and understand how each one operates, you can get better results from your workout pro- gram. You’ll understand, for example, how certain exercises can help you pre- vent lower-back pain. You’ll understand why you should do several different shoulder exercises, rather than just one. And you’ll be sure to perform your exercises properly. For example, if you know where your biceps are, you’ll realize exactly where you should feel the tension — and you can adjust your form if you don’t feel tension in the right spot. With many weight-training exercises, it’s easy to emphasize the wrong muscle if you don’t understand the purpose of the move. If you simply hop on a machine and pull some lever without knowing which muscle to focus on, you may be cheating yourself out of a good workout. Finally, knowing about all your major muscle groups helps you get a more complete and balanced workout. You’ll know not to leave any muscle group out. (See Figures 12-1 and 12-2 for a full view of your muscles.)\\n\\n172 Part IV: Lift and Curl: Building a Stronger Bod with Weights\\n\\nDeltoid\\n\\nPectorals\\n\\nBiceps\\n\\nExternal Obliques\\n\\nInternal Obliques\\n\\nRectus Abdominis\\n\\nAdductors\\n\\nQuadriceps\\n\\nTibialis Anterior\\n\\nFigure 12-1: Your muscles — front view.\\n\\nChapter 12: Your Muscles: Love ’Em or Lose ’Em\\n\\n173\\n\\nTrapezius\\n\\nDeltoid\\n\\nTriceps\\n\\nRhomboids\\n\\nErector Spinae\\n\\nLatissimus Dorsi\\n\\nForearm\\n\\nGluteus Medius\\n\\nGluteus Maximus\\n\\nHamstrings\\n\\nGastronemius\\n\\nSoleus\\n\\nFigure 12-2: Your muscles — back view.\\n\\n174 Part IV: Lift and Curl: Building a Stronger Bod with Weights\\n\\nThis section simply discusses the major muscles of the body; it doesn’t show you a weight-lifting technique for that muscle group. However, we do list our favorite exercises for each muscle group, and each exercise is described in Chapter 14. To find out about other exercises that we don’t list here, consult a trainer or our book, Weight Training For Dummies (published by Wiley).\\n\\nShoulders\\n\\nStrong shoulders are the key to building a strong upper body. Just about every exercise you can do for your chest and back involves your shoulders, too. If your shoulders are weak, you really limit the amount of weight you can use in the rest of your upper-body repertoire.\\n\\nDeltoids\\n\\nGiven name: Deltoids\\n\\nStreet name: Delts\\n\\nWhereabouts: Your delts wrap completely around the tops of your arms (see Figure 12-3). Cup your hand over your shoulder and you get the idea. Now swing your arm around in a circle, raise it up above your head, and then swing it forward and backward. You can see what a versatile muscle your shoulder is. The front portion of the shoulder muscle is referred to as the anterior delt, the side is called the medial delt, and the back is called the rear or posterior delt. Go ahead, toss those terms around and amaze your friends.\\n\\nDeltoids\\n\\nRotator Cuff (partial view)\\n\\nFigure 12-3: Strong shoulder muscles are the key to building a powerful upper body.\\n\\nChapter 12: Your Muscles: Love ’Em or Lose ’Em\\n\\n175\\n\\nJob description: Your delts help your arms move in a wide range of directions.\\n\\nThe training payoff: You’ll never have to wear shoulder pads if, heaven forbid, they ever come back in style. Also, strengthening your shoulders can help you avoid injuries such as shoulder dislocations or muscle tears. And with strong shoulders, you have no trouble putting that useless “waist trim- mer” gadget that you bought for $19.95 on the top shelf in the closet.\\n\\nSpecial tips: We tend to like free weights better than machines for strength- ening the shoulders. Although most shoulder-press machines have improv- ed in recent years, many other shoulder contraptions, especially lateral- raise machines, tend to be difficult to adjust and uncomfortable to use. Also, machines aren’t made for every shoulder movement. For example, no specific machine mimics the front shoulder raise. It’s important to target the front, middle, and back of your shoulders, as well as the delts as a whole, so make it a point to master several dumbbell exercises.\\n\\nOur favorite exercises: Dumbbell shoulder press, dumbbell lateral raise, dumbbell front raise, and dumbbell back delt fly\\n\\nRotator cuff\\n\\nGiven name: Rotator cuff\\n\\nStreet name: Rotators\\n\\nWhereabouts: Four small muscles beneath your shoulder (refer to Figure 12-3); together, they’re called your rotator cuff.\\n\\nJob description: Your rotator-cuff muscles hold your arm in its socket. You use these muscles to rotate the shoulder joint, such as when throwing and catching. Baseball pitchers are constantly sidelined with rotator-cuff injuries.\\n\\nThe training payoff: If you have weak rotators, you can damage them simply by carrying a briefcase or reaching across the table for Rice Krispies Treats — throwing a 90 mph fastball is not a prerequisite for injury (see Chapter 5). By making a special effort to strengthen these commonly injured muscles, you’re far less likely to tear or strain them.\\n\\nSpecial tips: In addition to doing rotator-cuff exercises, work your shoulders in a variety of directions. Your rotators are put into action whenever your deltoids are working; if your delts are weak and you do a heavy upper-body lift, you may do some serious rotator damage. If you have chronic shoulder pain, check with your orthopedist to see if you’ve injured your rotator cuff. Sometimes rotator tears can be corrected with exercise; other times, they require surgery.\\n\\n176 Part IV: Lift and Curl: Building a Stronger Bod with Weights\\n\\nOur favorite exercises: Internal and external rotation, performed with an exercise band, a dumbbell, or a weight plate, or on a cable crossover machine\\n\\nBack\\n\\nNeglecting your back muscles is tempting because you don’t face them in the mirror every day. But these muscles are just as important as the muscles in the front of your body, particularly when it comes to injury prevention.\\n\\nWe know a man who injured his back while putting on his underwear in the health-club locker room. He was lying on the floor stark naked for a few hours before he let the staff members call a nurse. Trainers had repeatedly reminded him to strengthen his lower-back muscles and abdominals. After that incident, he finally listened.\\n\\nTrapezius\\n\\nGiven name: Trapezius\\n\\nStreet name: Traps\\n\\nWhereabouts: Your trapezius is a fairly large, kite-shaped muscle that spans up into your neck, across your shoulders, and down to the center of your back (see Figure 12-4).\\n\\nTrapezius\\n\\nRhomboids\\n\\nLatissimus Dorsi\\n\\nFigure 12-4: The upper-back muscle team.\\n\\nChapter 12: Your Muscles: Love ’Em or Lose ’Em\\n\\n177\\n\\nJob description: Your trapezius enables you to shrug your shoulders. This muscle is also involved when you lift your arm, such as when hailing a cab.\\n\\nThe training payoff: A toned trapezius adds shape to your shoulders and upper back. Strengthening this muscle may also alleviate the neck and shoul- der pain you may get if you sit at a desk all day or if your phone is a permanent appendage to your ear.\\n\\nSpecial tips: Give your trapezius extra attention if you often carry a knapsack or heavy bag over your shoulder.\\n\\nOur favorite exercises: Shrug or shoulder roll with a barbell, two dumbbells, or — if your neck is extremely weak and tight — no weight at all\\n\\nLatissimus dorsi\\n\\nGiven name: Latissimus dorsi\\n\\nStreet name: Lats (Note: Don’t make the mistake of saying “laterals,” as some less-informed, bookwormish exercisers do.)\\n\\nWhereabouts: Feel the widest part of your back just behind your armpit — you’ve just found your latissimus dorsi, your largest back muscle. This muscle runs the entire length of your back, from below your shoulders down to your lower back (refer to Figure 12-4).\\n\\nJob description: Your lats enable you to pull, like when you open a door against the wind or drag your Great Dane into the vet’s office.\\n\\nThe training payoff: Well-toned lats make your hips and waist appear smaller by adding shape and width to your upper body. If you play sports — especially a racquet sport, golf, or hockey — strengthening your lats will enable you to power the ball or puck quite a bit further. Runners, walkers, and cyclists also should focus on their lats to help counteract that tendency toward rounded shoulders, which are the result of weak rhomboids (see the following section) and other muscles of the upper and middle back, as well as the result of tight delts (discussed in the “Deltoids” section) and pecs (see the “Chest (the Pectorals)” section).\\n\\nSpecial tips: When you do lat exercises, think of your arms simply as a link between your back and the bar or dumbbell. Focus on working your lats, not your arms.\\n\\nOur favorite exercises: Lat pull-down machine, dumbbell row, dumbbell pullover, T-bar row, seated cable row, chin-up, and pull-up\\n\\n178 Part IV: Lift and Curl: Building a Stronger Bod with Weights\\n\\nRhomboids\\n\\nGiven name: Rhomboids\\n\\nStreet name: None. Almost no one talks about them. (However, we did once hear them referred to as the “rheumatoids,” a term we thought was better suited for an octogenarian garage band.)\\n\\nWhereabouts: Your rhomboids are a small, rectangular group of muscles at the center of your back, hidden beneath your lower trapezius (refer to Figure 12-4).\\n\\nJob description: Your rhomboids pull your shoulder blades together so you maintain good posture.\\n\\nThe training payoff: With strong rhomboids, you’re less likely to hunch your shoulders forward.\\n\\nSpecial tips: Focus on your rhomboids to avoid poor posture and potential injury.\\n\\nOur favorite exercises: Chin-up and dumbbell back delt fly\\n\\nErector spinae\\n\\nGiven name: Erector spinae\\n\\nStreet name: Lower back\\n\\nWhereabouts: Your erector spinae run the entire length of your spine, but it’s the lower third of this muscle group that you strengthen when you perform the exercises we mention later in this section. The rest of this muscle group gets worked when you do upper-back exercises. Figure 12-5 shows where your erector spinae are located.\\n\\nJob description: Your lower-back muscles are responsible for straightening your spine — for example, when you stand up after tying your shoes. They also work in tandem with your abdominals to keep your spine stable when you move the rest of your body, like when you’re sitting in your car and you reach around for something in the back seat.\\n\\nThe training payoff: About 80 percent of adult Americans experience back pain at some point in their lives. You can prevent much of this pain by devoting equal time to strengthening your lower back and abdominal muscles. Strong lower-back muscles are also very important for posture. (Flexibility of the back is also key; see Chapter 6.)\\n\\nChapter 12: Your Muscles: Love ’Em or Lose ’Em\\n\\n179\\n\\nErector Spinae\\n\\nFigure 12-5: A look at the lower back.\\n\\nSpecial tips: The lower back is an injury-prone area. If you have constant lower-back pain, ask your doctor to recommend exercises for your specific problem.\\n\\nOur favorite exercises: Pelvic tilt and back extension on the floor or on a hyperextension bench\\n\\nChest (the Pectorals)\\n\\nThe fibers of your chest muscles spread out like a fan, connecting to your arms, ribs, collar bone (clavical), and breast bone (sternum). For this reason, your chest muscles respond well when you work them from a variety of angles. For example, you can do chest exercises while lying flat on your back on a bench, reclining at various angles, sitting upright, standing, or lying facedown (like when you do push-ups). Ask a trainer to show you several chest exercises so you can vary your workouts.\\n\\nGiven name: Pectorals\\n\\nStreet name: Pecs\\n\\nWhereabouts: Place your hand on your chest as if you’re pledging allegiance to the flag. You’ve found your pecs. (See Figure 12-6.)\\n\\nJob description: Thanks to your pecs you can push — a shopping cart, a lawn mover, or some jerk standing in your way. You also use your pecs to wrap your arms around something, like when you give your mom a bear hug.\\n\\n180 Part IV: Lift and Curl: Building a Stronger Bod with Weights\\n\\nPectoralis Major\\n\\nFigure 12-6: You work your pectorals when you do chest exercises.\\n\\nPectoralis Minor\\n\\nThe training payoff: With strong pecs, you look great in tight t-shirts. You also need strong chest muscles for sports like tennis, golf, and football.\\n\\nSpecial tips: For women — it’s important to understand that your pecs are not your breasts; in fact they reside directly underneath your breast tissue. However, toning your pecs can lift your breasts and make them appear firmer.\\n\\nFor men — don’t become obsessed with bench pressing to the point of excluding all other exercises. Men with overdeveloped chest muscles and wimpy legs resemble hard-boiled eggs on toothpicks. Besides, doing too much chest work sets you up for shoulder injuries.\\n\\nOur favorite exercises: Bench press, dumbbell fly, push-up, and incline dumbbell press\\n\\nArms\\n\\nTake a survey of today’s TV stars, fashion models, and music artists, and you can see that firm arm muscles are in style. Even department-store man- nequins now have toned arms. Be sure to give your front and rear arm mus- cles equal time; if one of these muscle groups is disproportionately stronger than the other, you’re at greater risk for elbow injuries.\\n\\nChapter 12: Your Muscles: Love ’Em or Lose ’Em\\n\\n181\\n\\nBiceps\\n\\nGiven name: Biceps\\n\\nStreet name: Bi(s) or guns\\n\\nWhereabouts: Your biceps are the two muscles at the front of your upper arm (see Figure 12-7) — the ones that pop up when you flex like a bodybuilder.\\n\\nJob description: Your biceps are responsible for bending your elbow. When you pick up this book or when you turn the pages, you use your biceps.\\n\\nThe training payoff: With strong biceps, lifting a stack of newspapers or carry- ing an armload of wood is easier. Your biceps also help out your back muscles when you pull a really stubborn weed out of your garden. Plus, strong biceps make you look buff.\\n\\nBiceps\\n\\nTriceps\\n\\nWrist Muscles\\n\\nWrist Muscles\\n\\nFigure 12-7: Your arm muscles (front and rear view).\\n\\n182 Part IV: Lift and Curl: Building a Stronger Bod with Weights\\n\\nSpecial tips: Many people have sloppy posture when they do biceps exercises — they rock their bodies back and forth to hoist the weight up. Not only is this posture dangerous for your lower back, but it also makes life too easy for your biceps. Pay special attention to form on bicep exer- cises, and don’t use more weight than you can handle.\\n\\nOur favorite exercises: Dumbbell biceps curl, concentration curl, barbell biceps curl, and machine arm curl\\n\\nTriceps\\n\\nGiven name: Triceps\\n\\nStreet name: Tri(s)\\n\\nWhereabouts: Your triceps are located at the back of your upper arm (refer to Figure 12-7).\\n\\nJob description: Your triceps do the opposite of what your biceps do; that is, your triceps straighten your elbow. Your triceps help out your chest muscles when you push something, like your 1966 Volkswagen Bug that has stalled at an intersection.\\n\\nThe training payoff: Triceps exercises help firm up bingo arms. That’s when the backs of your arms flap loosely away from the bones — a condition common among people whose main form of physical activity is playing bingo.\\n\\nSpecial tips: The triceps make up two-thirds of your upper-arm size, so if you want a nice pair of arms, work these muscles. Working your triceps is especially important if you often hold a briefcase or handbag while your arm is straight. If your triceps are weak — and that’s common because these muscles don’t get much work in daily life — you may be prone to elbow pain.\\n\\nOur favorite exercises: Triceps kickback, bench dip, triceps press-down, and triceps-extension machine or dumbbells/barbells.\\n\\nForearm muscles\\n\\nGiven name: Wrist extensors and flexors\\n\\nStreet name: Wrist or forearm muscles\\n\\nWhereabouts: These muscles run from the bottom of your elbow to your wrist (refer to Figure 12-7).\\n\\nChapter 12: Your Muscles: Love ’Em or Lose ’Em\\n\\n183\\n\\nJob description: Your forearm muscles bend and move your wrists. They’re also a link between your upper body and any barbell, lever, or dumbbell you move. If you don’t have the wrist strength to grip a barbell, you’re certainly not going to be able to bench-press, even if your chest muscles are strong.\\n\\nThe training payoff: Powerful wrist muscles give you a stronger grip for weight lifting. Wrist strength also can help prevent or alleviate tennis elbow (see Chapter 5) and carpal tunnel syndrome — a painful irritation of wrist nerves resulting from repetitive motions such as typing or certain assembly- line tasks, such as tightening a bolt with a wrench.\\n\\nSpecial tips: To ensure that you develop adequate wrist strength, wrap your hand firmly around the barbells or dumbbells you use.\\n\\nOur favorite exercises: Dumbbell wrist curl and reverse wrist curl\\n\\nAbdominals\\n\\nDeveloping a toned, flat abdomen has become somewhat of a national obses- sion. Most fitness magazines don’t let a month go by without an article titled “Midriff Madness!” or “Flatten Your Tummy in 3 Minutes a Day!” But don’t delude yourself: All the abdominal exercises in the world won’t make your tummy pancake flat; in order to whittle your middle, you need to lose the extra body fat stored on top of your abdominal muscles. Still, ab training is a must, both for good posture and for the prevention of lower-back pain.\\n\\nRectus abdominis\\n\\nGiven name: Rectus abdominis\\n\\nStreet name: Abs (Note: Don’t refer to your abdominals as your stomach, which is the organ responsible for digesting food.)\\n\\nWhereabouts: Your rectus abdominis is a flat sheet of muscle that runs from just under your chest down to a few inches south of your belly button (the top of your pelvis) (see Figure 12-8). This is one long, continuous muscle; you don’t have “upper abs” and “lower abs,” as many people mistakenly think. Although you can do exercises that emphasize the upper or lower portions of your rectus, all abdominal exercises do involve the entire muscle.\\n\\nThe muscle just below the rectus abdominis is the transverses abdominis, the deep stabilizer of the trunk. It’s responsible for protecting the trunk and spine; think of it as the body’s internal weightlifting belt.\\n\\n184 Part IV: Lift and Curl: Building a Stronger Bod with Weights\\n\\nInternal Oblique\\n\\nRectus Abdominis\\n\\nExternal Oblique\\n\\nFigure 12-8: These are your main abdominal muscles.\\n\\nJob description: Your rectus allows you to flex your spine and pull your torso or chest toward your hips, and it works with your lower-back muscles to keep your torso stable while you move the rest of your body. For example, when you’re shoveling dirt in your garden, your arms are moving, but you have to brace your body to get enough leverage and to protect your lower back.\\n\\nThe training payoff: The obvious reason to train your abdominals is to firm up your midsection. If your abs are really toned and you don’t have much excess fat around your middle, you can see six distinct sections of the muscle. This is known as washboard abs or the six pack. But having such a firm midriff is not worth fixating on — for most people, washboard abs are not a realistic proposi- tion. Even people with relatively low body fat tend to store at least some fat around the middle. Appearances aside, strong abs improve your posture by making it easier to stand up straight. Plus, they’re important for guarding against lower-back pain.\\n\\nSpecial tips: Those full sit-ups you did back in high school gym class won’t do the job — plus they’re hard on your back, especially if you lock your feet under a couch. Although many gyms have abdominal machines, we feel that floor exercises, including the ones we name later in this section, are more effective. We also like doing abdominal exercises while leaning against an oversized plastic ball known as a physioball. To prevent yourself from sliding off the ball, you have to keep adjusting your body position; this forces you to work your abs more completely, hitting some deeper muscle fibers that don’t get much of a workout while doing conventional crunches. As for those ab-strengthening gadgets advertised on TV infomercials, you’re better off spending your money on a Miracle Mop.\\n\\nOur favorite exercises: Abdominal crunch, reverse crunch, and physioball crunch\\n\\nChapter 12: Your Muscles: Love ’Em or Lose ’Em\\n\\n185\\n\\nInternal and external obliques\\n\\nGiven name: Internal and external obliques\\n\\nStreet names: Obliques or the waist\\n\\nWhereabouts: Your internal and external obliques run diagonally down the sides of your rectus abdominis (refer to Figure 12-8).\\n\\nJob description: Your obliques enable you to twist from the waist or do a side bend.\\n\\nThe training payoff: Strong obliques are essential for preventing lower-back pain. They work with your rectus abdominis and lower-back muscles to support your spine.\\n\\nSpecial tips: Doing side bends while holding a weight in each hand is not a good idea unless you want to build a thicker waist. In addition, placing a pole across your shoulders and twisting from side to side can wreak havoc on your lower back, especially if you do this movement a zillion times.\\n\\nOur favorite exercise: Crunch with a twist, plus side bends with an exer- cise ball\\n\\nButt and Hips\\n\\nIf your rear end and hips are larger than you’d like them to be, don’t be afraid to strengthen these muscles with weights. With the right workout program, these muscles can look firmer and more shapely, not bigger and bulkier. Also, strengthening your butt and hip muscles can help prevent hip and lower-back injuries. If your job requires you to sit on your rear end all day, doing exercises that target these muscles is a good idea.\\n\\nGluteus maximus\\n\\nGiven name: Gluteus maximus\\n\\nStreet name: Glutes, buns, or butt\\n\\nWhereabouts: The largest muscle in your body — as if you need anyone to tell you that. Your two glutes (left and right cheeks) span the entire width of your derriere (see Figure 12-9).\\n\\n186 Part IV: Lift and Curl: Building a Stronger Bod with Weights\\n\\nJob description: Your glutes extend your hips and help you jump, climb stairs and hills, and straighten your leg behind you. You also use your gluteus maximus when you stand up from a sitting position.\\n\\nThe training payoff: Training your glutes can lift your butt, make it rounder, and give it more shape. You also need your glutes to get off the couch so you can go work out.\\n\\nSpecial tips: Some glute exercises, such as the squat and the lunge (elon- gated variations of deep knee bends), can be hard on your knees, so pay extra attention to your form. When you bend your knees, your kneecaps should move in the direction that your toes are facing, and they should not shoot out past your toes.\\n\\nOur favorite exercises: Squat, lunge, and leg-press machine\\n\\nHip abductors\\n\\nGiven name: Hip abductors\\n\\nStreet name: Outer thighs or outer hip\\n\\nWhereabouts: The meatiest part of the side of your hips (refer to Figure 12-9)\\n\\nJob description: Your abductors help you slide your leg out to the side, like when you go skating or step aside so someone can get past you. These muscles also help your gluteus maximus (or butt) rotate your hips outward.\\n\\nAdductors\\n\\nGluteus Medius\\n\\nGluteus Maximus\\n\\nQuadriceps\\n\\nHamstring\\n\\nFigure 12-9: Your butt and upper- leg muscles.\\n\\nChapter 12: Your Muscles: Love ’Em or Lose ’Em\\n\\n187\\n\\nThe training payoff: Working your abductors can firm up your outer thighs and prevent hip injuries. Athletes and seniors should pay special attention to strengthening their hip muscles. You need strong abductors for running, jumping, pedaling, kicking, and skating — just about any movement that involves your lower body. Strong abductors also are important for maintain- ing a natural walking stride. If your hip abductors are weak, you tend to shuffle along.\\n\\nSpecial tips: Some exercise programs advise you to do hundreds of leg lifts to tone this area. But as we explain in Chapter 14, following this advice won’t get you anywhere. Work your outer thighs as you would any other muscle group — by doing 8 to 15 moderately challenging repetitions.\\n\\nOur favorite exercises: Outer-thigh machine and internal hip rotation\\n\\nLeg adductors\\n\\nGiven name: Leg adductors\\n\\nStreet name: Inner thighs\\n\\nWhereabouts: Your adductors are several muscles that run from inside your hip to various points along your inner thigh (refer to Figure 12-9). You don’t need to know each by name.\\n\\nJob description: Your adductors help you move one leg in front of the other, especially moving your leg to the midline of your body.\\n\\nThe training payoff: When you sit astride a horse or motorcycle, your inner hips squeeze inward to keep you from sliding off. You also use your inner- thigh muscles for skating, soccer, and swimming the breaststroke.\\n\\nSpecial tips: Forget the ThighMaster and the other “thigh toner” gadgets you see advertised on TV. You can work your inner-thigh muscles more effectively by adding exercise bands to floor exercises or by using machines in the gym specially designed to focus on these muscles. Don’t become fixated on ton- ing your inner thighs; the New England Journal of Medicine reported about a woman who had overused a thigh-toning gadget to the point that all the tendons of her inner thighs became inflamed. Ouch.\\n\\nOur favorite exercises: Inner-thigh machine and side-lying inner-thigh lift\\n\\n188 Part IV: Lift and Curl: Building a Stronger Bod with Weights\\n\\nLegs\\n\\nKeep in mind that, if all goes well, your legs will be carrying you from here to there for the rest of your life. So treat them with respect. By strengthening your leg muscles, you can head off many common knee and ankle injuries. And by staying healthy, of course, you can stay active. You can work out more and develop lean, toned legs that power you up a hill and look good in shorts.\\n\\nQuadriceps\\n\\nGiven name: Quadriceps\\n\\nStreet name: Quads\\n\\nWhereabouts: Your quadriceps are the four muscles at the front of each thigh (refer to Figure 12-9).\\n\\nJob description: Your quadriceps straighten your knee.\\n\\nThe training payoff: You need strong quads for walking, running, climbing, skiing, skating, hopping, skipping, and jumping. Keeping your quads strong can help prevent knee problems. (If you already have knee pain, check with your doctor to find out which exercises are best for you.)\\n\\nSpecial tips: Don’t worry if you feel an intense burning sensation when you do the leg extension, shown in Chapter 14. This is one of the few exercises that completely isolates the quads, which causes them to tire quickly. Waste prod- ucts like lactic acid flood into the muscles, causing you to really feel the burn.\\n\\nOur favorite exercises: Squat, lunge, leg press, and leg-extension machine\\n\\nHamstrings\\n\\nGiven name: Hamstrings\\n\\nStreet name: Hams\\n\\nWhereabouts: Your hamstrings are the three muscles at the back of your thigh (refer to Figure 12-9).\\n\\nJob description: Your hamstrings work in opposition to your quadriceps; in other words, your hamstrings bend the knee. They also help out your glutes when you move from a sitting to a standing position (see the “Gluteus max- imus” section earlier in this chapter).\\n\\nChapter 12: Your Muscles: Love ’Em or Lose ’Em\\n\\n189\\n\\nThe training payoff: Hamstring injuries are pretty common (if not properly strengthened and flexible) because hamstrings tend to be weak compared to quads. Weekend warriors are especially prone to hamstring pulls, usually when they sprint or jump suddenly, like when they leap for a fly ball during a game of pick-up softball. Suzanne even had a friend who pulled a hamstring muscle while bowling, just as he released the ball.\\n\\nSpecial tips: Because your hamstrings are susceptible to pulls, make sure they’re adequately warmed up before you perform strengthening exercises, and always stretch them after a workout. For tips on warming up, see Chapter 8.\\n\\nOur favorite exercises: Seated-leg-curl machine, lying-leg-curl machine, lunge, and dead-lift. For a good hamstring stretch, see Chapter 5.\\n\\nGastrocnemius and soleus\\n\\nGiven names: Gastrocnemius and soleus\\n\\nStreet name: Calves\\n\\nWhereabouts: Your gastrocnemius, also called your gastroc, is the large dia- mond-shaped muscle that gives shape to the back of your lower legs. (To see precisely what the gastroc looks like, pedal behind any top-notch cyclist.) The soleus resides underneath the gastroc (see Figure 12-10).\\n\\nJob description: Your calf muscles allow you to stand on your tiptoes and spring off the ground whenever you jump for joy.\\n\\nTibialis Anterior\\n\\nGastrocnemius\\n\\nSoleus\\n\\nFigure 12-10: Your lower- leg muscles.\\n\\n190 Part IV: Lift and Curl: Building a Stronger Bod with Weights\\n\\nThe training payoff: Strong and shapely calves don’t just look good; they also give you staying power when you take those long, romantic walks or wait in a three-hour line for Garth Brooks tickets. Plus, you need strong calves for dancing, jumping, running, and hopping.\\n\\nSpecial tips: With calf exercises, some people find it more effective to use slightly lighter weights and do a few more repetitions — say, up to 25 — than with most other muscle groups. The muscle tissue in your calves is made specifically for endurance (walking and standing), so it takes more repetitions to reach the deepest fibers.\\n\\nOur favorite exercises: Standing calf raise, seated calf raise, and standing- calf-raise machine\\n\\nTibialis anterior\\n\\nGiven name: Tibialis anterior\\n\\nStreet name: Shins\\n\\nWhereabouts: The tibialis anterior is the largest of several muscles that run from the top of your foot up the lower leg to the outside of the shin bone, near the knee (refer to Figure 12-10).\\n\\nJob description: Your shin muscles enable you to pull your toes toward your shin, as when you pick up your foot when walking or running.\\n\\nThe training payoff: Shin splints — throbbing pain at the front of your ankles caused by any sort of irritation or inflammation in the shins — are fairly common among walkers, runners, dancers, and aerobicizers who overdo it (see Chapter 5). You’re especially prone to this injury if your shin muscles are weak compared to your calf muscles.\\n\\nSpecial tips: If you do get shin splints, stay off your feet for a few days until the pain subsides. Icing and stretching can help speed recovery. For tips on icing, see Chapter 5.\\n\\nOur favorite exercises: You’re not likely to find a special machine at the gym to work your shins, so try the following exercise, called the toe lift: Stand flat on your feet and lift your toes off the floor 8 to 15 times. If you don’t have access to this machine, you can stand on a step or a stair, balancing on your heels and arches, with your toes hanging off the edge of the step. Hang on for support, and lift your toes 8 to 15 times.\\n\\nChapter 13 Demystifying Strength Equipment\\n\\nIn This Chapter (cid:1) Figuring out weight machines (cid:1) Using dumbbells and barbells: The pros and cons (cid:1) Mastering cable pulleys (cid:1) Toning with rubber tubes and bands (cid:1) Using your body as weight equipment\\n\\nSome weight-lifting contraptions look like the convergence of a gynecolog-\\n\\nIt’s only natural to stare at them and think: Where do I sit? What do I push? Has anyone ever been killed on one of these things?\\n\\nical examination table, a minimalist sculpture, and an all-terrain vehicle.\\n\\nAs far as we know, no one has ever exploded on the Butt Blaster or been mashed into lunchmeat by the leg-press machine. Weight equipment is not as complicated as it appears. Still, you need to know what the heck you’re looking at and how to use each machine safely. In this chapter, we cover the vast array of strength-training equipment that you can use at home or at health clubs, including the latest developments in gym machines and free weights. We explain the pros and cons of each type of device and help you choose the right equipment for your goals. For advice on buying strength equipment for your home, see Chapter 20.\\n\\nWeight Machines\\n\\nIf you can unfold a lawn chair, you’re more than qualified to operate a weight machine. It all comes down to two relatively simple acts: You adjust your seat and then you either push or pull a bar or a set of handles. These handles are connected to a cable, chain, or lever, which, in turn, is attached to a stack of rectangular weight plates. Each plate in the stack weighs between 5 and 20 pounds, depending on the make and model, and has a hole drilled in the center. If you want to lift 30 pounds, you stick a metal peg, called a pin, into the hole on the plate marked “30.” When you pull the machine’s handles, the cable picks up 30 pounds.\\n\\n192 Part IV: Lift and Curl: Building a Stronger Bod with Weights\\n\\nYou may also come across machines that don’t have a weight stack. Instead, you adjust the poundage by sliding donut-shaped weight plates onto a thick peg. Jargon-heads call these plate-loaded machines. The weight plates are the same ones used for loading up barbells. (See the “Free Weights” section later in this chapter for details about weight plates.) The two most popular brands of plate-loaded machines are Hammer Strength and CYBEX. Many plate-loaded machines are designed so that each arm or leg works independently of the other, a feature we like because it forces your weaker side to work hard.\\n\\nWeight machines have been around for more than a hundred years. Back in the ’60s, Arthur Jones, inventor of the Nautilus machines, created the most significant innovation in weight machines to date. Jones realized that when you lift a barbell or dumbbell, there are certain points during the exercise that feel very heavy and certain points that feel light. (Try a biceps curl with a dumbbell, and you see that the dumbbell is hardest to move when your forearm is parallel to the floor.) Because your muscle is only fully working at the instances where the weight is difficult to lift, Jones concluded, traditional exercises don’t give your muscles a complete workout. Then Jones realized that if you use a machine with a kidney-shaped pulley rather than a round one, your muscles feel resistance during the entire exercise and can be strengthened more completely.\\n\\nMost of today’s weight machines still work under the same principles that Jones discovered, but they have become smoother, safer, and more comfort- able to use. Most of the top brands, including Body Masters, CYBEX, Hammer Strength, Nautilus, LifeFitness, and ICARIAN do an excellent job. The brands generally differ in the size and shape of the pulleys; the angles of the bars, seats, and weight stacks; and the type of seat and handle adjustments. You may like the Nautilus chest press but prefer the CYBEX back machine. Try every machine in your gym at least once. Even if the machines are all the same brand, you may feel more comfortable using, say, the vertical chest press rather than the horizontal one.\\n\\nThe weight machines designed for home use — called multi-gyms — generally aren’t as sophisticated as health-club machines, but in many cases, your muscles won’t know the difference.\\n\\nThe advantages of machines\\n\\nMachines are ideal for beginners, because they’re quite safe. If you can’t muster the strength to finish an exercise, you don’t have to worry about dropping a bar on your chest. But one caveat: Don’t stick any body part near a weight stack that is being lifted or lowered. Liz saw a woman place her hand on a weight stack as she pulled out the pin. Sixty pounds of weight came crashing down on the woman’s palm. She was rushed to the hospital, where her hand was repaired with eight stitches. Liz also saw a woman with long hair lean over to pull out a pin before lowering the weight stack; the last\\n\\nChapter 13: Demystifying Strength Equipment\\n\\n193\\n\\n4 inches of her hair got pressed between the weights. Fortunately, Liz and other staff members were able to rectify the situation without giving the woman a new hairstyle.\\n\\nMost machines require little coordination; they basically hold your body in position and guide you through the motion. Consider the shoulder-press machine. You simply sit in a chair and push the handles up — all your effort goes into lifting those handles. But if you’re shoulder pressing with a barbell (defined in the “Free Weights” section later in this chapter), you not only have to push the bar up but also have to keep it balanced and steady. Initially, your arms may wobble back and forth. Even after you get the hang of it, the exercise always requires a certain amount of balance and coordination.\\n\\nYou may come across one type of machine that does require coordination. These “free-floating” machines look like regular weight machines, but the levers don’t move in a fixed pathway. You have to control the motion so the bar doesn’t wobble. These machines are designed to give machine users a free-weight feel while retaining the safety aspect of machines. But we’re not high on the concept. We think these machines are too complicated for begin- ners and not very satisfying for advanced lifters. If an experienced lifter wants the feel of free weights, he’ll likely prefer the real McCoy.\\n\\nAnother plus for traditional machines: They’re helpful for isolating a particular muscle group. Isolating is just gymspeak for zeroing in on one muscle (actually, using a single joint in a motion) rather than getting several muscles or joints into the act. This is helpful if you’re trying to correct a specific weakness. For example, if your hamstrings (rear-thigh muscles) are underdeveloped, you can use a machine that holds your whole body still while you bend your legs to target your hamstrings. With free weights, you’ll have a harder time strengthen- ing your hamstrings without working your front-thigh and butt muscles, too.\\n\\nFinally, machines — at least those with weight stacks — let you get in a faster workout with less stopping and starting to adjust the weights. Instead of sliding weight plates on and off or removing free weights from the rack, you simply place a pin in a hole and adjust the seat. If your gym has 10 or 12 machines grouped in a circle, square, or similar shape, you can move from one right to the other, exercising your whole body in less than 20 minutes. Typically, machines that work your larger muscle groups (chest, back, butt, and thighs) come before machines that work your shoulders and arms.\\n\\nThe drawbacks of weight machines\\n\\nYou may want to stick to machines initially, but plan to mix in some free weights after a month or two of working out two or three days a week. Machine circuits can get pretty boring — for you and your muscles. You need to stimulate your muscles with at least occasional changes in your workout. Typically, a gym has only two or three machines for each muscle group; with free weights, you can strengthen each muscle with dozens of exercises.\\n\\n194 Part IV: Lift and Curl: Building a Stronger Bod with Weights\\n\\nWeight machines for women\\n\\nMany women don’t fit into conventional weight- training machines. Either their legs dangle off the floor when they hop up into the seats, or their arms are too short to reach the bar they’re supposed to grab.\\n\\nAbout ten years ago, Nautilus recognized these problems and designed weight-training machines especially for women. Today you can find these machines in women-only gyms and in many large gyms that have several lines of equip- ment. Some gyms carry only one or two pieces, usually chest machines because they’re the ones smaller women have the most trouble using.\\n\\nIn addition to downsizing the frames, Nautilus researchers studied the way women lift weights. They found that, like men, women are stronger at\\n\\ncertain points in an exercise and weaker at other points; however, they also discovered that for men and women these points are not the same. So, they set up the machines’ pulleys differently from conventional machines to give women a better workout. They also made the weight increments smaller — you can go up by 5 pounds instead of 10.\\n\\nLiz likes the Nautilus women’s line a lot because she is, shall we say, not anyone’s first choice to play center on a basketball team. The line includes the only pec deck (a type of chest machine with a butterfly motion) she has ever used that didn’t make her feel as if her shoulder was going to be ripped out of its socket.\\n\\nRealize, too, that every weight machine won’t fit every body. Most machines are designed for people of average height, so if you’re shorter than 5\\'4\" or taller than 6\\'2\", you may not be able to adjust the seat to fit your body. (Figuring out which machines don’t fit may take you a while, however. Unlike amusement parks, gyms don’t post height-requirement signs.) Manufacturers have tried to get around the height problems by offering a variety of pads to sit on or stick behind you, but they don’t work for everyone. If a machine feels uncomfortable to you — even if you’re of average height — try another machine that targets the same muscle group or head for the free-weight area. As we describe in the “Weight machines for women” sidebar, Nautilus makes a line of machines scaled for women’s bodies.\\n\\nAnother drawback of machines is that many of them isolate each muscle group. We know we said this was an advantage, but it can be a flaw. Because you rarely isolate your muscles in everyday life, some experts believe it doesn’t make sense to train them that way in the gym. If muscles become used to working as separate entities, the theory goes, they don’t cooperate with one another to the extent they should — a situation that may set you up for injuries.\\n\\nChapter 13: Demystifying Strength Equipment\\n\\n195\\n\\nConsider the lying leg curl, a popular hamstring machine. You lie flat on your stomach and then bend your knees until your heels approach your rear end. This exercise does a nice job of focusing on your hamstrings, but when in real life do you lie on your stomach and kick yourself in the butt? (Actually, we have relatives who do this when they throw tantrums, but apparently they don’t need to train for them.) Some experts believe you’re better off strength- ening your hamstrings with exercises such as squatting, a motion you use often in daily life, like when you pick up a heavy box. Because each has its advantages, we recommend doing both free-weight and machine exercises.\\n\\nOne final reason to venture beyond machines: You can’t take ’em with you. If you’re on vacation and your hotel gym has nothing more than a pile of dumbbells, you need to know what to do with them. Don’t give yourself another excuse to blow off a workout.\\n\\nSpecial tips for machines\\n\\nDon’t let weight machines scare you. Use the following tips to look like an old pro next time you go to the gym:\\n\\n(cid:2) Make the adjustments. Don’t just hop on a machine and start pumping away. If the last guy who used it was a foot taller than you are, you may find yourself suspended in midair in the middle of the exercise.\\n\\nTo adjust a machine, you usually have to pull out a pin, shift the seat up or down, and then reinsert the pin. Adjusting the seat is a hassle at first, but if you don’t do it, you set yourself up for an injury. Also, you cheat yourself out of a good workout. For instance, if you don’t adjust the biceps-curl machine correctly, you may compensate by using your back muscles, thereby defeating the purpose of the exercise.\\n\\nLet a trainer show you how to adjust each machine to fit your body. In general, line up the joint that you’re trying to move (your knees, for example) with the joint of the machine that’s moving. You shouldn’t have to strain in any way to do the movement. If you begin to feel any discomfort, particularly in your joints, stop the exercise and readjust the set or position, as needed.\\n\\n(cid:2) Check the weight stack before you lift. Never begin the exercise with-\\n\\nout checking where the pin has been inserted. If someone has racked the machine (put the pin all the way on the bottom so the entire weight stack is captured), either your eyes are going to pop out of your head or you’re going to be mighty embarrassed when you can’t budge it. When you first learn to use a machine, write down the weight and seat adjust- ment (“leg extension: 30 lbs., second setting”) on a card or in a workout log. Carry these notes with you and update them regularly.\\n\\n196 Part IV: Lift and Curl: Building a Stronger Bod with Weights\\n\\n(cid:2) Remember the name of each machine. You should not refer to the lat pull-down as “that one where you pull down that bar thingy.” Knowing what to call each contraption reminds you what the heck you’re doing — you’ll remember that you’re working your lats, assuming you remember what those are. (If you don’t, see Chapter 12.) Most machines have some sort of name plaque or label. Check that the name of the machine you’re using corresponds to the name of the machine on your workout card. (cid:2) Stay in control. If the weight stack bangs and clangs like a junior-high marching band, you’re probably lifting too fast, and you’re definitely annoying the guy on the machine next to you. Many machine manufac- turers recommend taking two slow counts to lift the weight stack up and four slow counts to lower the weight stack down. You may feel more comfortable speeding it up to a 2-2 count. When you become a more advanced lifter, you may want to try SuperSlow training, a method that involves a full 20 seconds per repetition. We describe this controversial technique in Chapter 14.\\n\\n(cid:2) If the machine has a seat belt, use it. We’re not aware of any gyms that enforce seat-belt laws, but that belt is there for a reason: to keep you stable while you move through an exercise. Not every machine has one, so check carefully.\\n\\n(cid:2) Change the weight in the smallest increment possible. Most machines have half plates hanging on the frame. Instead of increasing your weight by an entire plate, you can place this thin rectangle on top of the stack. CYBEX and other equipment manufacturers have come up with an inge- nious way to increase weight by one-third of a plate, a system used on some of its machines. Each machine has an abacus-like apparatus linked to the stack of 20-pound weight plates. To increase the weight, you slide a weighted disk toward the stack, increasing the weight by 5 pounds. There are three disks per abacus, allowing you to go from 10 pounds to 15 pounds to 20 before moving on to a new plate.\\n\\nFree Weights\\n\\nFree weights are nothing to be afraid of. They’re simply bars with weight plates on each end, and they’re perfectly suitable for people who don’t envi- sion a Mr. Olympia title in their future. The long bars are called barbells, and the short bars are called dumbbells (see Figure 13-1). It takes two hands to hoist a barbell. You can lift a dumbbell with one hand, although you may do some exercises using two hands on a single dumbbell.\\n\\nBarbells and dumbbells are called free weights because they’re not attached to any chains, cables, or weight stacks. You’re free to do with them whatever you want, although we recommend using them for strength training rather than, say, banging nails into a wall.\\n\\nChapter 13: Demystifying Strength Equipment\\n\\n197\\n\\nFigure 13-1: You can use dumbbells for hundreds of exercises.\\n\\nPhotograph by Sunstreak Productions, Inc.\\n\\nAt most gyms, you find a wide array of dumbbells, lined up from lightest, usu- ally 3 pounds, to heaviest, as much as 200 pounds. At larger gyms, you also find a selection of bars with plates welded to each end, starting with 20 pounds and increasing in 10-pound increments.\\n\\nVirtually every gym has bars without weight plates on each end. The long bar (also called an Olympic bar) alone usually weighs 45 pounds. To increase the poundage, you slide weight plates — round plates with a hole through the center — to each end. You then secure the plates with clips called collars. An assortment of these weight plates, typically from 21⁄2 pounds to 45 pounds, sits on a rack near the bars. If you want to lift 75 pounds, you add a 10-pound plate and a 5-pound plate to each side of the 45-pound bar. After you finish, be sure to remove these plates and put them back in their proper place. Otherwise, you risk unfriendly stares from the staff and the guy or gal who uses the bar after you.\\n\\nIf you’re lucky, your gym will have weight plates made by Iron Grip. These plates are easier to carry than the traditional ones because they have han- dles built in. Imagine the difference between carrying a suitcase with a handle and without. We suspect they prevent back problems caused by improperly lifting standard weight plates. The handles also keep the plates from slipping and dropping to the floor. A few other brands have copied this concept, but we like Iron Grip the best.\\n\\n198 Part IV: Lift and Curl: Building a Stronger Bod with Weights\\n\\nHow to spot and be spotted\\n\\nIf you spend enough time in the gym, sooner or later someone is going to ask you, “Hey, mind giving me a spot?” He’s not asking you to buy him a puppy; he would like assistance with his next set. You should be flattered at the request, but be aware that spotting is an awesome responsibil- ity. It falls on your shoulders to prevent the weight from, well, falling on the guy’s shoulders.\\n\\nBy the way, don’t hesitate to ask for a spot your- self if you think you may have trouble completing a set. A spotter is particularly helpful when you graduate to a heavier weight. You can enlist help from a health-club staff member; or better yet, ask anyone nearby who doesn’t look too busy. (This is a good way to make friends at the gym, too.) Fill your spotter in on your game plan. Mention how many reps you think you can do and on which rep you think you’d like to call in the cavalry.\\n\\nHere’s how to handle the job of spotting a fellow weight lifter: (cid:2) Pay attention at all times. Don’t get into a heated discussion about the war in Iraq. You need to be ready, on a split-second’s notice, to lift the bar off your spottee’s chest if his arms give out. Politely tune out the rest of the world until your spottee completes his set. (cid:2) Ask your spottee where he’d like you to place your hands. There are several schools of thought on this subject. You can rest a fingertip or two on the bar at all times so you can give instantaneous help when your spottee calls for it — usually during the last repetition or two. Some people, includ- ing us, find that position annoying, because it diminishes the feelings of glory you expe- rience when you complete a set by yourself. We prefer the ready-willing-and-able spot- ting technique. That is, have your hands poised a couple inches from the bar; touch the bar only when your spottee begins to\\n\\nstruggle. Some spotters also place their hands on the joint or limb doing the move- ment, as close to the bar as possible (for example, on the wrists).\\n\\n(cid:2) If you don’t think you can handle spotting someone, say so. This is no time for heroics. In order to spot someone bench-pressing 100 pounds, you need not be able to bench 100 pounds yourself — you’re just there to help out. However, if you have trouble lifting the 5-pounders off the rack, you’re not a can- didate for this job.\\n\\n(cid:2) Use proper posture. This means not rounding your spine, keeping a good center of gravity, and making sure you’re in a stable position. (cid:2) Don’t over-spot. You’re there to help the guy, not do the work for him. When you’re spot- ting someone on the bench press, don’t lean directly over the bar, grip it with both hands, and pull it up and down. With a little experi- ence, you’ll be able to provide just the right amount of additional effort that the person needs to complete the exercise. (If you’re the one being spotted, you may want to say something like, “Don’t help me until I really need it.” You can also scream, “I got it! I got it!” if it looks like your spotter is going to prematurely swoop in to help.)\\n\\n(cid:2) Always offer encouraging words. Say things like “It’s all yours! You got it! You got it! All you!” This gives your spottee inspira- tion to squeeze out that last repetition. Plus, it makes everyone else in the gym glance over in admiration.\\n\\n(cid:2) No matter which end of the spot you’re on, pleasant breath is a must. Remember, you’ll be breathing forcefully right into someone’s face. You don’t want to find a bottle of Scope waiting for you in your locker.\\n\\nChapter 13: Demystifying Strength Equipment\\n\\n199\\n\\nThe advantages of free weights\\n\\nFree weights are much more versatile than machines. Whereas a weight machine is designed for one particular motion, a single pair of dumbbells can be used to perform literally hundreds of exercises. For instance, you can push dumbbells overhead to work your shoulders, press them backward to tone your triceps, or hold one in each hand while you squat to strengthen your thighs and butt muscles. You can change the feel and emphasis of an exercise by simply altering the way you grip the bar.\\n\\nAnother important benefit of free weights is that they work your muscles in a way that closely mimics real-life movements. Machines tend to isolate a par- ticular muscle so the rest of your muscles don’t get any action. But free- weight training requires several muscles to move, balance, and steady a weight as you lift and lower it. Free-weight exercises allow you to strengthen muscles that wouldn’t get much work if you were doing isolation exercises with machines. Some people find they gain strength and increase in size faster when they do the majority of their exercises with free weights.\\n\\nThe drawbacks of free weights\\n\\nFor some novices, free-weight exercises are hard to get the hang of. You need more instruction than you do with machines — there are a lot more mistakes to make and injuries to avoid. Also, free-weight exercises require more bal- ance than machine moves. If you’re short on time, a free-weight workout probably will take you longer than a machine workout. Instead of simply putting a pin in a weight stack, you may have to slide weight plates on and off a bar. But if a gym has various free weights available without having to change plates, this may not be the case.\\n\\nSpecial tips for free weights\\n\\nAnyone using free weights needs to be very careful, even with light weights. Debbie Bacon of Phoenix, Arizona, learned this lesson the hard way. While waiting for her husband to come home late one night, Debbie decided exer- cising might help her stay awake. She was doing shoulder exercises with 7- pound dumbbells when she got so tired that she lost control of the weights and they crashed together. Unfortunately, her right index and ring fingers got in the way. The incident involved a fractured fingertip and a piece of acrylic nail that got lodged where it shouldn’t have been. But we’ll spare you the gory details. Suffice it to say that free weights require your full attention. Here are a few other tips to make free-weight training safe and fun:\\n\\n200 Part IV: Lift and Curl: Building a Stronger Bod with Weights\\n\\n(cid:2) If you’re using very heavy weights, enlist a spotter. (See Figure 13-2\\n\\nand the sidebar “How to spot and be spotted” in this chapter.)\\n\\n(cid:2) Be careful when you lift a weight from a rack and when you put it back. Never pick up a weight off the floor without bending your legs. (cid:2) Never drop the weights carelessly when you’ve completed a set. The loud clang is sure to annoy your fellow lifters, and the weights may roll away and land on someone’s toes.\\n\\n(cid:2) Use two hands when lifting weight plates. Remember that plates are\\n\\nweight, too, and you can just as easily hurt yourself placing a weight on a bar as you can performing an exercise. Don’t attempt to lift a weight plate onto a bar if it’s too heavy for you.\\n\\nFigure 13-2: Spotting the bench press.\\n\\nPhotograph by Sunstreak Productions, Inc.\\n\\nA word about benches\\n\\nA bench can help you get a better workout. Some benches are flat, and some are upright, like narrow chairs with high, padded backs. Others are adjustable so you can slide them to an incline or decline position. Here are some tips for using benches:\\n\\nChapter 13: Demystifying Strength Equipment\\n\\n201\\n\\n(cid:2) Experiment with the angle of the bench, especially for chest exercises. Inclining the bench a few degrees allows you to work the muscle fibers of your upper chest. (But attempting chest exercises at too high an angle can put your shoulder joint in jeopardy.) Declining the bench emphasizes your lower chest. You can use a slightly different angle each workout if you want.\\n\\n(cid:2) Use a bench for support. When you’re doing overhead lifts or bicep\\n\\ncurls, adjust the seat so it’s upright, and sit snugly against it. This posi- tion protects your back and prevents you from cheating. You won’t be able to rock your body back and forth to build momentum to hoist the dumbbell. You have to rely solely on the muscle power of your biceps. However, you’ll still have to stop yourself from arching the small of your back off the bench when the weight gets heavy.\\n\\n(cid:2) Use weight-lifting benches for one activity only: lifting weights. Don’t\\n\\nuse a bench to change a light bulb at home and don’t use it at the gym to take a nap. Never use a weight bench for step aerobics. You can, however, use your step bench as a weight bench as long as you’re not lifting dumb- bells heavier than, say, 30 pounds.\\n\\n(cid:2) Keep your feet flat on the floor or flat on the bench — whichever is\\n\\nmore comfortable.\\n\\n(cid:2) Don’t put your feet up in the air, especially if you’re a beginner. This creates an unstable position and looks like you want your stomach scratched. Instead, keep your feet firmly planted on the floor.\\n\\nCable Pulleys\\n\\nAt most gyms, you see a box full of ropes, straps, handles, short bars, long bars, V-shaped bars, and bars shaped like a handlebar mustache. This para- phernalia looks like a pile of junk excavated from someone’s garage. But in fact, these are the attachments you can clip onto a cable machine to do a wide variety of exercises. The cable machine consists of a cable and a round pulley attached to a metal frame.\\n\\nTo strengthen your back, you can pull down a bar clipped to a high pulley — one that’s attached all the way at the top. To strengthen your biceps, you can pull up on a low pulley — attached near the bottom of the frame, typically a few inches from the floor. To strengthen your chest, you can grab a high pulley on each side of the frame and pull both handles toward your chest, as if you’re going to wrap your arms around someone.\\n\\nCable pulleys are a cross between machines and free weights. On the one hand, the cable is hooked up to a stack of weights, so nothing can come crashing down. On the other hand, the motion isn’t guided — you’re free to pull the bar down the way you want to, and you’re free to make lots of mis- takes. Like free weights, cable machines require a certain amount of control.\\n\\n202 Part IV: Lift and Curl: Building a Stronger Bod with Weights\\n\\nDon’t be afraid to play around with the different types of adjustments. Attach- ing a new bar is easier than it looks, and you may find that, when working your triceps, a V-shaped bar feels more comfortable than a straight bar. When you do make the switcheroo, you may need to adjust the amount of weight you’re using. Even if you’re doing the very same exercise, you may use more weight pulling down the V-shaped bar than you would pulling down the straight bar.\\n\\nTubes and Bands\\n\\nExercise tubes are like the thick rubber tubes you can find in a medical-supply store — they just come in brighter colors. Some exercise tubes have handles or buckles attached to each end (see Figure 13-3), or they come in a kit with attachable plastic bars and door attachments. You also can buy exercise bands, which are long, flat sheets of strong rubber.\\n\\nFigure 13-3: You can use exercise tubes to strengthen virtually every muscle in your body.\\n\\nPhotograph by Sunstreak Productions, Inc.\\n\\nYou can exercise virtually every muscle group in your body with bands and tubes, although tubes work better for some exercises, while bands work better for others. You just have to experiment. Here’s how you can use bands to work both of your biceps at once: You stand on the center of the band and hold an end in each hand, with your elbows by your sides. Bend your arms\\n\\nChapter 13: Demystifying Strength Equipment\\n\\n203\\n\\nand curl your hands up toward your shoulders. Lower your arms slowly so the band doesn’t just snap back into place. (You can find a whole chapter full of band exercises in our book Weight Training For Dummies, published by Wiley.)\\n\\nThe advantages: Bands and tubes take up zero space, and they’re portable. They give you an instant strength workout, whether you’re in a small studio apartment, in a hotel room, or on a camping trip in the Mojave Desert. Bands and tubes are easy to adjust, too; to make an exercise tougher, just use a shorter or thicker band or step farther away to stretch the band further and increase the level of resistance. They’re also cheap: You can purchase a couple of bands for around $10. Even if you go hog wild, you’d have trouble spending more than $60 on a set of bands, a travel bag, and a video explain- ing how to use the bands.\\n\\nThe drawbacks: If a band or tube slips, you can get snapped in the face or groin. Ouch. Also, reproducing the same amount of work from one workout to the next is difficult. You know when you’re lifting a 20-pound dumbbell or a 50-pound weight stack, but bands and tubes have no comparable measuring system. They simply come in different resistances: usually light, medium, heavy, and extra-heavy. (There’s no universal code for color. One company’s yellow band may be the easiest resistance, whereas another company’s yellow band may be the most difficult. Look for band thickness.) Also, know that there’s a limit to how much strength you can gain with bands.\\n\\nWhen you’re using bands and tubes, keep the following tips in mind:\\n\\n(cid:2) Lift and lower the band or tube slowly. If you move carefully, you’ll feel\\n\\nyour muscles working in both directions.\\n\\n(cid:2) Don’t wrap the band or tube so tightly around your palms or feet that\\n\\nyou cut off the circulation to your hands or feet. Instead, wrap it loosely several times so that it forms loops, the way you wind a dog’s leash around your hand.\\n\\n(cid:2) When you wrap a band or tube under your feet, make sure that it’s\\n\\nsecure. You don’t want a band to slip out from under you.\\n\\n(cid:2) Use bands or tubes that are specifically designed for exercising. Inspect them frequently for holes and tears and replace them when they’re worn.\\n\\nYour Body\\n\\nYes, your very own body can function as strength equipment. You can lift it, lower it, curl it, twist it, and bend it in all sorts of ways that are designed to increase your strength. We’re talking leg lifts, push-ups, pull-ups, and the like. When you move your body weight, you’re fighting gravity — and that can be a considerable fight.\\n\\n204 Part IV: Lift and Curl: Building a Stronger Bod with Weights\\n\\nThe advantages: You don’t require any storage space and you certainly can take yourself anywhere. Plus, push-ups and pull-ups are impressive, and they call upon just about every muscle in your upper body. If you’re really serious about building upper-body strength, add push-ups and pull-up-type exercises to your strength-training routine.\\n\\nThe drawbacks: Ever try a pull-up? They’re darned hard. Most people can’t do pull-ups until they’ve spent at least a few months lifting weights. And then, eventually, they have the opposite problem: The pull-ups become too easy. To continue making progress, you may need to invest in equipment or join a gym.\\n\\nChapter 14 Designing a Strength-Training Program\\n\\nIn This Chapter (cid:1) Defining sets and reps (cid:1) Knowing how often and how much to lift (cid:1) Maintaining proper form (cid:1) Targeting your abdominals (cid:1) Trying exercises for all the major muscle groups\\n\\nScan the fitness aisle in any bookstore or video store and you find fitness\\n\\nbest solution to building a new you. “I can’t stand to know a secret that can help others without telling them about it,” says one popular instructor.\\n\\nexperts who claim to have discovered the Secret, the Answer, the world’s\\n\\nWell, we have a secret, too: There are no secrets to weight training. To find a program that works for you, you need to experiment with a variety of training methods. Lifting weight is an art, not an exact science.\\n\\nIn this chapter, we present an array of tools you can use to custom-design a strength-training program. We address questions such as, “How much weight should I lift?”, “How many exercises do I need to do?”, and “How many days a week should I work out?” There’s no single answer to any of these questions. You need to decide what your goals are, which techniques you like best, and which ones your body responds to. Also, we recommend consulting with a qualified trainer at least once before you embark on a strength-training pro- gram. (See Chapter 4 for tips on finding a competent trainer.)\\n\\nThe Building Blocks of a Weight Workout\\n\\nYou can’t begin to design a strength-training program without knowing two terms: rep and set.\\n\\n206 Part IV: Lift and Curl: Building a Stronger Bod with Weights\\n\\n(cid:2) Rep is short for repetition — one complete motion of an exercise.\\n\\nSuppose you’re doing a leg lift. When you lift your leg and then lower it back down, you’ve completed one rep.\\n\\n(cid:2) A set is a group of consecutive repetitions. For example, you can say, “I did two sets of ten reps on the chest press.” This means that you did ten con- secutive chest presses, rested, and then did another ten chest presses.\\n\\nHow many reps should I do?\\n\\nThe number of reps you should do depends on where you are in your training (new, experienced, coming back from a long layoff) and your goals. To become as strong and as big as your body type will allow, do fewer than eight or ten reps per set. To tone your muscles and develop the type of strength you need for everyday life — moving furniture or shoveling snow — aim for 10 to 12 rep- etitions. Doing dozens of reps with ultralight weights (weights you can barely even feel) doesn’t bring good results of any kind, because you’re not stressing your muscles enough.\\n\\nNo matter how many repetitions you do, always use a heavy enough weight so that the last rep is a struggle, but not such a struggle that you compromise good form. After about a month of strength training, you may want to go to muscular failure (that is, your last repetition is so difficult that you can’t squeeze out one more).\\n\\nIf you have a few different goals in mind, you can mix and match the number of reps you do per workout. If you want to get bigger and stronger and also improve the endurance of those muscles, you can do a heavy workout one day and a lighter workout the next time out. Keep track of how you feel; your body may respond better to one type of training than another.\\n\\nBe sure to adjust the amount of weight you use for each exercise. In general, use more weight to work larger muscles like your thighs, chest, and upper back, and use less weight to exercise your shoulders, arms, and abdominals. But even when doing different exercises for the same muscle group, you’re likely to need a variety of weights. For example, you typically can handle more weight on the flat chest-press machine than you can on the incline chest-press machine.\\n\\nWrite down how much weight you lift for each exercise so that next time around, you don’t have to waste time experimenting all over again. But don’t lock yourself into lifting a certain amount of weight every time. Everyone feels stronger on some days than on others. Just because you can bench- press 80 pounds on Monday doesn’t mean you’ll be able to do it on Wednesday. Listen to your body. It’ll tell you what it can and can’t handle.\\n\\nChapter 14: Designing a Strength-Training Program\\n\\n207\\n\\nHow much should I lift?\\n\\nTo increase strength, you need to lift an amount that stresses your muscles. So, although we can’t tell you a specific amount to lift, we can tell you that it has to be enough so that you feel challenged as you’re lifting, and so that the last rep is difficult to complete (difficult, but still possible and still using good form).\\n\\nAfter about age 30, you lose bone mass for the rest of your life. But don’t let that frighten you, because there is a solution. To maintain bone density (that is, to build enough bone density to offset the loss of bone density that occurs as you age), you need to perform weight-bearing exercise. Weight-bearing exercise means that your skeleton is supporting any sort of weight, as it does when you walk, run, or — yes — lift weights. Theories abound as to why weight-bearing exercise builds bone density, but the most probable is that your body creates osteoblasts, or cells that form more bone when muscles are stressed. This phe- nomenon occurs when muscles flex and the tendons to which they’re attached pull on the bone to which they are connected. This means that when your muscles (and, thus, your bones) are placed under pressure, as they are during weight-bearing exercise, your bones adapt to the pressure and become more dense (and that means they’re stronger). Weight lifting is one of the best ways to build bone density, because you’re loading your muscles (and, therefore, your bones) with weights. But keep in mind that as your muscles gain strength, you need to gradually increase the load on them by increasing the amount of weight you lift.\\n\\nHow do I know when I’m ready to lift more weight?\\n\\nIt won’t take long to outgrow the weights you use during your first workout. When you can easily do the maximum number of reps you’re aiming for, increase the weight by the smallest increment possible and drop down to fewer reps. You know you’re lifting too much weight if you can’t complete your repetitions with good form and if you feel the need to grunt.\\n\\nNot all muscles improve at the same rate. After a month of weight training, you may jump up 20 pounds on a chest exercise but only 5 pounds on a shoulder exercise.\\n\\nHow fast should I do my reps?\\n\\nTake a full 2 seconds to lift a weight and 2 to 4 seconds to lower it. If you lift more quickly than that, you may hear a lot of clanging and banging (of the\\n\\n208 Part IV: Lift and Curl: Building a Stronger Bod with Weights\\n\\nweights). Plus you’ll end up relying on momentum rather than muscle power. Going slow and steady yields better results because more of your muscle gets into the act.\\n\\nSome trainers take this notion even further, advocating repetitions that last an excruciating 20 seconds or more, a technique called SuperSlow training. We think that SuperSlow workouts may have a place in advanced exercise routines but are too challenging and result in too much muscle soreness for novice exercisers.\\n\\nSuperSlow works like this: You take 20 more seconds (which means moving in super-slow motion) to do each repetition and perform 3 to 5 reps. Although the number of reps may seem low, keep in mind that SuperSlow lifters spend about twice as much time on each exercise as do traditional weight lifters, and some swear they see more rapid improvements in strength, although those improvements haven’t been borne out in studies.\\n\\nThis technique can be done with machines, free weights, or body weight (such as push-ups), and it’s very, very hard, because you can’t use any momentum the way you can with traditional weight lifting. In fact, SuperSlow is so exhausting that at one New York gym that advocates this approach, a sign on the wall warns exercisers not to drive for at least 30 minutes after a workout. SuperSlow training requires more patience than most people have, and even people who try it and like it rarely continue with the training. If you decide to try SuperSlow, it’s best if you’re coached through your reps by a trainer with experience using this technique.\\n\\nWe also disagree with many of the beliefs promoted by a group of trainers called the SuperSlow Exercise Guild. These trainers maintain that one or two weekly SuperSlow workouts are the best way to achieve fitness and that car- diovascular exercise is not a necessary part of fitness training, even to pre- vent conditions like heart disease and high blood pressure. We couldn’t disagree more! As we explain throughout this book, the ideal fitness program includes a combination of cardiovascular, flexibility, and strength workouts.\\n\\nHow many sets should I do for each muscle group?\\n\\nThere’s no simple answer. Several studies show that doing one set per muscle builds just as much strength as doing three sets per muscle, at least for the first three or four months of training. So here’s our advice: If you’re a novice or if you’re starting again after a layoff, begin with one set of 10 to 12 repeti- tions, and make sure your last rep feels challenging. You should feel like you have control of the weight but if you did one more rep, you may not be able to make it all the way. Most people can increase their initial weights after two\\n\\nChapter 14: Designing a Strength-Training Program\\n\\n209\\n\\nto four weeks of training; at that point, consider adding a second or even third set for each muscle group. However, if your goal is simply to build enough strength for good health, one challenging set may be sufficient.\\n\\nIf you’re aiming for maximum strength or a physique like the ones you see on ESPN body-building competitions, you need to do at least 10 to 20 sets per muscle group!\\n\\nHow long should I rest between sets?\\n\\nThe amount of rest you take in between sets is another variable that you can toy around with. If you’re a beginner, rest about 90 seconds between sets to give your muscles adequate time to recover. As you get in better shape, you need less rest — only about 30 seconds — before your muscles feel ready for another set. If you follow a chest exercise with, say, a thigh exercise, you typi- cally need less rest than if you do consecutive exercises for the same muscle group, such as two chest exercises in a row.\\n\\nAfter the first few weeks of training, you can fine-tune the amount of rest you take between sets according to your goals. If you’re using really heavy weights and doing fewer reps in order to bulk up, you can take up to 5 minutes between sets so that your muscles can pump out their greatest effort each time.\\n\\nIf you’re short on time or you like a fast-paced workout, try circuit training: You move quickly from exercise to exercise with little or no rest at all. Circuit training does a decent job of building strength, and can be a good substitute for an aerobic workout, especially if you start and end with a fairly long aero- bic warm-up and cooldown. See Chapter 15 for details.\\n\\nIn what order should I do my exercises?\\n\\nIn general, exercise larger muscles before smaller ones. Work your back and chest before your shoulders and arms, and your butt before your thighs and calves. Smaller muscles assist the larger muscles. If the smaller muscles are too tired to pitch in and do their job, they give out long before your big mus- cles get an adequate workout. For example, your biceps help out your upper back when you do a lat pull-down, an exercise where you pull a bar down to your chest. If you work your biceps first, they’ll be too tired to do their job during the pull-down, and your back muscles won’t get as good a workout.\\n\\nAs for which muscles to start with — chest, back, or legs — that’s up to you. You may want to begin with all your chest exercises and then move on to your back. Or you can alternate chest and back moves. You can fit your abdominal exercises in whenever you like, as long as you remember to do them. (See the “All about Abs” section for more on exercising your abdominals.)\\n\\n210 Part IV: Lift and Curl: Building a Stronger Bod with Weights\\n\\nHow many times a week do I need to lift weights?\\n\\nStart by lifting two or three days per week for several weeks, completing one set of 10 to 12 reps. Increase to two or three sets. If your aim is maximum strength, targeting each muscle three times a week may not give your mus- cles enough chance to rest. In that case, cut back to two workouts per muscle group per week.\\n\\nIf you really get into weight training, consider doing a split routine, in which you exercise some of your muscles during one workout, and then come back a day or two later to exercise the others. You still work each muscle at least twice a week, but because you don’t train every muscle during every workout, you can devote more energy to the muscles you’re focusing on that day — and each of your muscles still gets enough rest.\\n\\nSplitting your routine is a good idea, especially if you’re serious about build- ing muscle and if you have free time in small chunks. You may be fresher and more motivated if you walk into the gym knowing that, today, you have to work only your chest, triceps, and shoulders. You probably work these mus- cles harder than if you try to fit all your muscle groups into one workout.\\n\\nHere are the two most popular ways of splitting a routine:\\n\\n(cid:2) Push/pull: Work your pulling muscles (your back muscles and biceps) on one day, and during the next session, work your pushing muscles (your chest and triceps). You can fit in your leg, shoulder, and abdominal exer- cises whenever you want. Following is an example of a push/pull routine. In Chapter 12, we list several exercises for each muscle group; you can learn them from a trainer or a book.\\n\\nDay\\n\\nMuscles Worked\\n\\nMonday\\n\\nPush (chest, triceps, shoulders, lower-body exercises)\\n\\nTuesday\\n\\nPull (back, biceps, abdominals)\\n\\nWednesday\\n\\nREST\\n\\nThursday\\n\\nPush (chest, triceps, shoulders, lower-body exercises)\\n\\nFriday\\n\\nREST\\n\\nSaturday\\n\\nPull (back, biceps, abdominals)\\n\\nSunday\\n\\nREST\\n\\nChapter 14: Designing a Strength-Training Program\\n\\n211\\n\\n(cid:2) Upper body/lower body: You work your upper body one day and your lower body the next. You fit in your abs two to four times a week when- ever it’s convenient. (See Chapter 12 for definitions of gluteals, quadri- ceps, and the like.)\\n\\nDay\\n\\nMuscles Worked\\n\\nMonday\\n\\nUpper body (back, chest, shoulders, triceps, biceps)\\n\\nTuesday\\n\\nLower body (gluteals, quadriceps, hamstrings, calves, abdominals)\\n\\nWednesday\\n\\nREST\\n\\nThursday\\n\\nUpper body (back, chest, shoulders, triceps, biceps)\\n\\nFriday\\n\\nREST\\n\\nSaturday\\n\\nLower body (gluteals, quadriceps, hamstrings, calves, abdominals)\\n\\nSunday\\n\\nREST\\n\\nWhatever workout schedule you design, make sure each muscle group gets at least one full day of rest between sessions. You can lift two days back to back, but you don’t want lift with your upper body, for example, two days in a row. Lifting weight literally creates tiny little tears in your muscles. They need those 48 hours to recover and rebuild. (You can do aerobic training on consecutive days because it’s much easier on your muscles than weight training.) If you don’t rest in this way, you may wind up sore and more prone to overuse injuries. (Keep in mind that perpetual soreness can be a sign of overtraining.) Besides, overworking a muscle may weaken it, defeating your purpose for training.\\n\\nHow often should I change my routine?\\n\\nSome people change some or all of their exercises every time they work out. There’s no hard-and-fast rule on this subject, but we recommend that you try at least one new exercise every month. After you learn a basic routine, such as the one we demonstrate in the last section of this chapter, expand your repertoire so that you have more options to choose from. Varying your exer- cises keeps you more interested and can help you get better results. If you stick with the same routine month after month, year after year, your muscles adapt to those exercises; but by working your muscles from a variety of angles, you involve more muscle fibers and keep your muscles challenged.\\n\\nChanging your exercises isn’t the only way to keep you — and your muscles — stimulated. You also can play with other variables, such as how many sets and reps you perform and how much rest you take between sets.\\n\\n212 Part IV: Lift and Curl: Building a Stronger Bod with Weights\\n\\nAdvanced weight-training techniques\\n\\nWe call the following techniques advanced, but novices can use them, too (most of them, anyway — we let you know which ones are off limits for beginners). (cid:2) Super set: You do two consecutive sets of dif- ferent exercises, preferably ones that exer- cise opposite muscle groups (like quadriceps and hamstrings) without resting in between. For example, you can do one chest exercise immediately followed by a different chest exercise and then take a rest. The idea is to completely tire out the muscle — to work it so hard that you reach the deepest muscle fibers. You also can do a super set with exer- cises that target different muscle groups, like a chest exercise followed by a leg exercise. With this type of super set, you don’t rest between exercises — the purpose is simply to save time.\\n\\n(cid:2) Pyramids: You do multiple sets of an exer- cise, increasing the weight for each set while decreasing the number of reps. You may do a light warm-up set for ten reps, then a heavier set for eight reps, then an even heavier set for six reps, and so on, until you reach a weight at which you can do only one rep. You don’t have to go all the way down to one rep for your workout to be\\n\\nconsidered a pyramid. The idea is to work up slowly and fatigue the muscle.\\n\\n(cid:2) Negatives: Someone helps you lift a weight, and then you’re on your own for the lower- ing, or negative, phase of the lift. Your mus- cles generally can handle more weight when you lower a weight than when you lift it, so this technique gives you a chance to really tire out your muscles. Note: If you’re a beginner, don’t try negatives. They can cause significant muscle soreness.\\n\\n(cid:2) Breakdowns (also called drop sets or descending sets): You lift a heavy weight, and as soon as you exhaust the muscle — however many reps it takes — you pick up a lighter weight and squeeze out a few more reps. You might do ten reps of an exercise and then drop 5 pounds and try to eke out three or four more reps. The theory is that you use more of your muscles this way. You have to dig deeper because the muscle fibers you normally use are already pooped out.\\n\\n(cid:2) SuperSlow training: See the “How fast should I do my reps?” section earlier in this chapter for details. Note: It’s generally not for beginners.\\n\\nConsider trying periodization, a method of organizing your workout program into several periods, each lasting about four weeks. Each phase has a different emphasis:\\n\\n(cid:2) The first month you may do a basic routine, using moderate weights and\\n\\nperforming one set of eight to ten reps of each exercise.\\n\\n(cid:2) In the next period, you may go for more strength, lifting heavier weights,\\n\\ndoing six to eight repetitions and taking more rest between sets. (cid:2) In the third phase, you may focus on building stamina, doing 10 to 12\\n\\nrepetitions and taking less rest between sets.\\n\\nPeriodization is great if you’re a beginner, because it helps you focus on one goal at a time.\\n\\nChapter 14: Designing a Strength-Training Program\\n\\n213\\n\\nAll about Abs\\n\\nAbs are everywhere these days, from infomercials featuring “ab-flattening” products to the covers of fitness magazines, promising ten steps toward wash- board abs. To have great-looking abs — and who doesn’t want that? — you need to develop the abdominal muscles through strength training. But keep in mind that even rock-hard, six-pack abdominal muscles won’t look like a washboard if they have a layer of fat over them. If you’re overweight, abdomi- nal strength training will hone your abs, but you won’t see those ab muscles until you lose body fat.\\n\\nThere are more theories about abdominal strength training than there are about the Kennedy assassination. Here’s our take on getting your midsection into shape. (Read Chapter 12 to discover the names and functions of your four abdominal muscles; see “The strength workout” section in this chapter for step-by-step instructions for the exercises mentioned here.)\\n\\n(cid:2) Don’t do abdominal exercises every day. Your abs, like all your other muscle groups, need a day of rest between workouts. And be sure that, just like strengthening any other muscle group, your last few reps are difficult to complete.\\n\\n(cid:2) Do up to 3 sets of 10 to 25 reps. If you’re able to whip off 100 ab exer- cises without breaking a sweat, chances are you’re doing the exercises too quickly or are engaging muscles other than the abs to complete the exercise. See the following section for two exercises (Basic Crunch and Ball Crunch) that isolate the abdominal muscles.\\n\\n(cid:2) Stay away from abdominal machinery. Instead, stick with exercises\\n\\nperformed on the floor, such as the crunch and moves performed with a physioball (both demonstrated in the following section). We’re not fond of most abdominal weight machines because they tend to bring the lower-back or hip muscles into the act. Nor do we like those abdominal infomercial gadgets that you can strap over your knees or stick under your butt; they force you to pay money for something you don’t need.\\n\\nThe only type of ab device we’re not entirely opposed to are ab-roller contraptions. You’ve probably seen them on TV: You lie in the center of a semi-circular metal frame, rest your head on a foam pad, place your arms atop the curve of the frame, and curl upward in a crunching motion. An ab roller can function like training wheels on a bike, guiding you through the correct path of motion until you’re strong enough and skilled enough to perform it on your own. Also, it supports your head to reduce neck pain. However, when you’re past the remedial stage of ab training, foregoing the ab roller and performing crunches under your own power is more effective. (Still, some trainers like to use the ab roller on occasion for the sake of variety.)\\n\\n214 Part IV: Lift and Curl: Building a Stronger Bod with Weights\\n\\n(cid:2) If you can do more than 12 reps of an abdominal exercise, you’re\\n\\neither doing the reps too quickly or with poor form, or the exercise is too easy for you. As with any other exercise, you should be struggling on the last repetition. Doing 100 continuous reps of any ab exercise is inefficient.\\n\\n(cid:2) To make abdominal exercises more challenging, you can do them at a slight incline, so that your head is lower than your legs. This is more effective than holding a weight plate on your abdomen. However, don’t fix your feet in place; this shifts the work from your abdominals to the muscles in your lower back and at the front of your hips.\\n\\nA Simple Functional Workout\\n\\nIn this section, we provide you with a total-body workout — a snazzy term referring to a routine that covers all the major muscle groups in your body. You can perform this routine either at home or at the gym. All you need for this workout are dumbbells (four to eight pairs should suffice) and a weight bench. In case you have access to health-club machines, we include a second exercise, which we call a gym alternative, for each muscle group.\\n\\nThis section also offers general rules for lifting weights safely as well as tips on how to progress after you master this workout.\\n\\nReading the exercise instructions\\n\\nDon’t worry: Our directions are in plain English, not like those assemble-it- yourself furniture manuals. For each exercise, we tell you which muscles the move targets. Then, where appropriate, we include a Warning icon that iden- tifies potential joint injuries and reminds you to pay special attention if you’ve ever injured the joint in question. Never work through an injury; if you feel pain, review your technique and slow down the pace to make sure you’re performing the move correctly. If you’re using good form and you still hurt, skip the exercise for now. You may want to try it again after you’ve been exer- cising for a few weeks. Or, you may need to try a different exercise that tar- gets the same muscle.\\n\\nYou notice that in the exercise descriptions, we use a few phrases over and over again. Here’s a brief explanation of these phrases, which you’re likely to hear from trainers and group-exercise instructors:\\n\\n(cid:2) “Pull your abdominals in.” This doesn’t mean to suck in your gut so hard that you can’t breathe. Simply pull your abs slightly inward, a movement also known as tightening or contracting your abs. You’re\\n\\nChapter 14: Designing a Strength-Training Program\\n\\n215\\n\\npulling your belly button up and in toward your spine. Imagine that you’re wearing a pair of underwear that’s one size too small; when you pull your abs in, it’s like tightening the underwear another two sizes down. This position helps hold your torso still while you exercise, pro- tecting your lower back from injury and ensuring that you’re actually using the muscle you’re intending to work.\\n\\n(cid:2) “Stand up tall.” You don’t need to stand like a guard at Buckingham\\n\\nPalace, but do lift your chest and keep your head centered between your shoulders. No slumping allowed!\\n\\n(cid:2) “Tilt your chin toward your chest.” Tilt your chin just enough to fit\\n\\nyour closed fist between your chest and chin. This position lines up the vertebrae of your neck with the rest of your spine. If you tilt your chin back or drop it toward your chest like you’re sulking, you put excess pressure on your neck.\\n\\nLifting weights the right way\\n\\nThe way some people lift weights, you’d think they were in labor or imper- sonating a mountain gorilla. Grunting, screaming, and rocking back and forth are not indications of proper weight-lifting technique. We’ve seen people invent some pretty outrageous exercises. One guy bent over, picked up a very heavy dumbbell, lifted it straight over his head so that he almost fell backward, and then threw it to the ground so hard that it bounced and broke a mirror. He seemed quite pleased with himself.\\n\\nWhether you’re performing the exercises that we feature in this chapter — or any other exercise you try — the following rules always apply:\\n\\n(cid:2) Always warm up. Before you lift a weight, do at least five minutes of aer- obic exercise to get your muscles warm and pliable. If you’re going to do arm exercises and there aren’t any upper-body aerobic machines around (such as a VersaClimber, rower, or cross-country skier), you can even do a few minutes of arm circles.\\n\\n(cid:2) Good form is always more important than lifting a lot of weight. Don’t arch your back, strain your neck, or rock your body to generate momen- tum. Not only can these maneuvers cause injury, but they also make the exercises less effective.\\n\\n(cid:2) Increase your weight by the smallest possible increment. Jumping\\n\\nfrom a 5-pound weight to a 10-pounder doesn’t sound like a big leap, but think about it: You’re doubling the load on that muscle. If you’re using a 5-pound weight, move up to a 6-, 7-, or 8-pounder. If your health club or home gym doesn’t have interim weights, buy a pair of PlateMates — nifty magnets that you stick on each end of a dumbbell or barbell. (See Chapter 25 for details.)\\n\\n216 Part IV: Lift and Curl: Building a Stronger Bod with Weights\\n\\n(cid:2) Remember to breathe. In general, exhale forcefully through your mouth as you lift the weight and inhale deeply through your nose as you lower it. Just don’t overdo it because overly forceful breathing can leave you feeling lightheaded. Although proper breathing is important for speeding oxygen to your muscles, don’t get hung up on the mechanics. Some people spend so much time trying to get the correct breathing pattern down that they lose track of what they’re doing. Just don’t hold your breath. You can bring about sharp increases in your blood pressure, and you can even faint from lack of air.\\n\\nDo, however, hold your breath during extremely heavy lifts. This pro- tects your spine by bracing it with the pressure from the held breath. We mention this information on the outside chance that some world-class power lifter reads this section and becomes incensed by the omission of it. Don’t hold your breath unless you’re aiming to lift world-record amounts of weight.\\n\\n(cid:2) Use a full range of motion. In other words, pull or push as far as you’re supposed to. (If you’re not sure, a trainer can show you the correct range of motion for each exercise. See Chapter 4 for tips on finding a personal trainer.) Using the full range of motion enhances your flexibil- ity. However, you don’t want to go past a natural range of motion because this can cause injury to the joint. For example, lifting dumbbells out to the side above shoulder level puts too much stress on the shoul- der. Sitting down too far when you squat can cause knee injuries.\\n\\n(cid:2) Pay attention. Remind yourself which muscle you’re working, and focus on that muscle. It’s easy to do lat pull-downs without challenging your lats. And it’s easy to do abdominal crunches without really working your abs. Suzanne recently watched a guy perform abdominal crunches with the sports section of the newspaper lying on his lap. He tried to steal a glance at the paper every time he curled his torso up. We suspect his abs aren’t getting much in the way of results.\\n\\nA word about the exercises\\n\\nThe 18 exercises described in this section aren’t your only options. We could write an entire book about strength training exercises. In fact, we did write that book: Weight Training For Dummies (published by Wiley), which features more than 130 exercises using a vast array of equipment. So how did we choose the moves that we demonstrate in this book?\\n\\nWe emphasize dumbbell exercises because you can easily perform them at home or at the gym. The particular dumbbell exercises that we show here are all suitable for beginners; they don’t require the brawn of an NFL defensive end or the coordination of an Olympic gymnast. Also, many of these moves perform double or triple duty; for example, the squat works three lower-body muscles — your front thighs, rear thighs, and derriere — in a single exercise.\\n\\nChapter 14: Designing a Strength-Training Program\\n\\n217\\n\\nThe machines we show here generally mimic the dumbbell moves, working your muscles with a similar movement and from similar angles. Virtually every health club has these machines, in addition to other contraptions that work your muscles in different ways, and we highly recommend exercising each muscle group from a variety of angles. After you become familiar with the basic exercises shown here — in about six to eight weeks — we suggest you consult a trainer, a video, or other books to expand your repertoire.\\n\\nThe strength workout\\n\\nIn the following sections, we introduce you to some of our favorite strength exercises.\\n\\nSquat In addition to strengthening your butt muscles, the squat also does a good job of working your quadriceps and hamstrings. If you have hip, knee, or lower-back problems, restrict the distance your knees travel during this exer- cise by bending only part of the way down.\\n\\nGetting set With either your hands on your hips or holding dumbbells with your arms down at your sides, stand with your feet as wide apart as your hips and place your weight slightly back on your heels. Let your arms hang down at your sides. Pull your abdominals in and stand tall with square shoulders. (See Figure 14-1a.)\\n\\nThe exercise Sit back and down, as if you’re sitting into a chair (refer to Figure 14-1b). Lower as far as you can without leaning your upper body more than a few inches forward. Don’t lower any farther than the point at which you’re paral- lel to the floor, and don’t allow your knees to shoot out in front of your toes. Once you feel your upper body fold forward over your thighs, straighten your legs and stand back up. Don’t lock your knees at the top of the movement.\\n\\nTechnique tips Keep these tips in mind as you perform the squat:\\n\\n(cid:2) Keep your head up and eyes focused on an object directly in front of you. Your body tends to follow your eyes, so if you’re staring at the ground, you’re more likely to fall forward. Imagine balancing a book on top of your head.\\n\\n(cid:2) When you stand back up, push through your heels rather than shifting your body weight forward. Don’t let your heels (or toes) lift off the floor.\\n\\n(cid:2) Try not to arch your back as you stand up.\\n\\n218 Part IV: Lift and Curl: Building a Stronger Bod with Weights\\n\\nFigure 14-1: The squat strengthens your butt and works your quadriceps and hamstrings.\\n\\na\\n\\nb\\n\\nPhotograph by Sunstreak Productions, Inc.\\n\\nGym alternative: Leg-press machine This is an excellent squat alternative for those who have chronic knee prob- lems or who don’t have good balance. Set the leg-press machine so that when you’re lying on your back, your shoulders fit snugly under the shoulder pads, and your knees are bent to an inch or so below parallel to the foot plate. Place your feet as wide as your hips with your feet pointing forward. Grasp the handles. (See Figure 14-2.)\\n\\nPull your abdominals in and keep your head and shoulders on the back pad. Push upward until your legs are nearly straight, just short of locking. Then bend your knees, controlling the weight as you go down, until your thighs are parallel to the foot plate.\\n\\nStanding calf raise The standing calf raise targets your calf muscles, particularly the larger, out- ermost muscle that is responsible for the shape and size of your calves.\\n\\nGetting set Stand on the edge of a step. (Or, if you have a step-aerobics platform, place two sets of risers underneath the platform.) Stand tall with your abdominals pulled in, the balls of your feet firmly planted on the step, and your heels hanging over the edge. Rest your hands against a wall or a sturdy object for balance.\\n\\nChapter 14: Designing a Strength-Training Program\\n\\n219\\n\\nFigure 14-2: The leg- press machine is a great alternative to the traditional squat.\\n\\nPhotograph by Sunstreak Productions, Inc.\\n\\nThe exercise Raise your heels a few inches above the edge of the step so that you’re on your tiptoes (see Figure 14-3a). Hold the position for a moment, and then lower your heels below the platform, feeling a stretch in your calf muscles (see Figure 14-3b).\\n\\nFigure 14-3: The standing calf raise works your calf muscles.\\n\\na\\n\\nb\\n\\nPhotograph by Sunstreak Productions, Inc.\\n\\n220 Part IV: Lift and Curl: Building a Stronger Bod with Weights\\n\\nTechnique tips\\n\\nKeep these tips in mind as you perform the standing calf raise:\\n\\n(cid:2) Lift as high as you can onto your toes and lower your heels down as\\n\\nmuch as your ankle flexibility allows.\\n\\n(cid:2) Push evenly through the entire width of your foot. Don’t push off from\\n\\nyour big toe or the outside edge of your feet.\\n\\nGym alternative: Toe press on the leg-press machine Lie on the leg-press machine with your shoulders snugly underneath the pad. To lift the weight stack, straighten your legs completely, and carefully walk your feet down the foot platform until your heels hang off the end. Keeping your legs straight, rise up on your tiptoes as high as you can (see Figure 14-4) and then lower down until your heels are below the level of the foot plate. After you complete all the reps, carefully walk your feet back to the center of the foot plate before bending your knees and lowering the weights.\\n\\nFigure 14-4: As an alternative to the standing calf raise, try the toe press on the leg-press machine.\\n\\nPhotograph by Sunstreak Productions, Inc.\\n\\nOne-arm dumbbell row Exercising your upper back without machinery isn’t easy, but this move is one that does a good job. The one-arm dumbbell row also strengthens your biceps and shoulders. Be especially careful if you have lower-back problems.\\n\\nChapter 14: Designing a Strength-Training Program\\n\\n221\\n\\nGetting set Stand to the right of your weight bench, holding a dumbbell in your right hand with your palm facing in. Place your left knee and your left hand on top of the bench for support. Let your right arm hang down and a bit forward. Pull your abdominals in and bend forward from the hips so that your back is naturally arched and roughly parallel to the floor, and your right knee is slightly bent. Tilt your chin toward your chest so that your neck is in line with the rest of your spine. (See Figure 14-5a.)\\n\\nThe exercise Pull your right arm up until your elbow is pointing to the ceiling, your upper arm is parallel to the floor, and your hand comes to the outside of the ribcage (refer to Figure 14-5b). Lower the weight slowly back down.\\n\\na\\n\\nFigure 14-5: The one- arm dumbbell row is a great way to work your upper back.\\n\\nb\\n\\nPhotograph by Sunstreak Productions, Inc.\\n\\n222 Part IV: Lift and Curl: Building a Stronger Bod with Weights\\n\\nTechnique tips\\n\\nKeep these tips in mind as you perform the one-arm dumbbell row:\\n\\n(cid:2) Concentrate on pulling from your back muscles (right behind and\\n\\nbelow your shoulder). Don’t just move your arm up and down. Although your arm is moving, this is a back exercise. Think of your arm as a hook that connects to the weight and is pulled by the back. (cid:2) Keep your abs pulled in tight throughout the motion. (cid:2) Don’t let your back sag toward the floor or hunch up. (cid:2) Pull your shoulders back and down to set the shoulder blades.\\n\\nGym alternative: Seated row machine Set your seat height so that when you grasp the handles, your arms are level with your shoulders (see Figure 14-6). Sit tall in the seat facing the weight stack with your chest against the pad.\\n\\nRemaining tall, pull the handles toward you to lift the weight stack. When your hands are a few inches in front of your chest, slowly straighten your arms to lower the weight.\\n\\nFigure 14-6: Try the seated row machine as an alternative to the one-arm dumbbell row.\\n\\nPhotograph by Sunstreak Productions, Inc.\\n\\nDumbbell chest press The dumbbell chest press closely mimics the bench press — the all-time favorite exercise among serious weightlifters everywhere. This exercise works your chest muscles, along with your shoulders and triceps. If you have shoulder, elbow, or lower-back problems, limit the range of motion. You should lower and lift the dumbbells only a few inches to avoid over- straining these joints.\\n\\nChapter 14: Designing a Strength-Training Program\\n\\n223\\n\\nGetting set Lie on the bench with a dumbbell in each hand and your feet flat on the floor (or up on the bench if it’s more comfortable). Push the dumbbells up so that your arms are directly over your shoulders and your palms up. Pull your abdominals in, and tilt your chin toward your chest. (See Figure 14-7a.)\\n\\nThe exercise Lower the dumbbells down and a little to the side until your elbows are slightly below your shoulders (refer to Figure 14-7b). Roll your shoulder blades back and down, like you’re pinching them together and accentuating your chest. Push the weights back up, taking care not to lock your elbows or allow your shoulder blades to rise off the bench.\\n\\nTechnique tips Keep in mind the following tips as you perform the dumbbell chest press:\\n\\n(cid:2) Let your back keep a natural arch so that you have a slight gap\\n\\nbetween your lower back and the bench.\\n\\n(cid:2) Don’t contort your body in an effort to lift the weight. Lift only as\\n\\nmuch weight as you can handle while maintaining good form. (cid:2) When pressing the dumbbells up, have them form a triangular\\n\\nmotion; they don’t need to touch each other.\\n\\nFigure 14-7: The dumbbell chest press works your chest muscles, shoulders, and triceps.\\n\\na\\n\\nb\\n\\nPhotograph by Sunstreak Productions, Inc.\\n\\n224 Part IV: Lift and Curl: Building a Stronger Bod with Weights\\n\\nGym alternative: Vertical chest-press machine Sit so that the center of your chest lines up with the center of the horizontal set of handlebars. Press down on the foot bar so that the handles move forward. Grip the horizontal handles and push them forward, straightening your arms. Lift your feet from the foot bar so that the weight of the stack transfers into your hands. Slowly bend your arms until your elbows are slightly behind your chest (see Figure 14-8), and then push the handles forward until your arms are straight. After you complete the set, put your feet back on the foot bar and let go of the handles before you lower the weight stack all the way down.\\n\\nFigure 14-8: The vertical chest-press machine is our pick for a gym alternative to the dumbbell chest press.\\n\\nPhotograph by Sunstreak Productions, Inc.\\n\\nDumbbell shoulder press The dumbbell shoulder press targets your shoulders, placing some emphasis on your triceps and upper back. Use caution if you have lower-back, neck, or elbow problems.\\n\\nGetting set Hold a dumbbell in each hand and sit on a bench with back support. Plant your feet firmly on the floor about hip-width apart. Bend your elbows and\\n\\nChapter 14: Designing a Strength-Training Program\\n\\n225\\n\\nraise your upper arms to shoulder height so the dumbbells are at ear level. Pull your abdominals in so there is a slight gap between the small of your back and the bench. Place the back of your head against the pad. (See Figure 14-9a.)\\n\\nThe exercise Push the dumbbells up and in until the ends of the dumbbells touch lightly, directly over your head, and then lower the dumbbells back to ear level. (Refer to Figure 14-9b.)\\n\\nTechnique tips Keep these tips in mind as you perform the dumbbell shoulder press:\\n\\n(cid:2) Keep your elbows rigid without locking them at the top of the\\n\\nmovement.\\n\\n(cid:2) Press your back against the back support without flattening out the\\n\\ncurve in your back.\\n\\n(cid:2) Bring your arms and elbows down, keeping your elbow joints in line\\n\\nwith your shoulders.\\n\\n(cid:2) If the bench is tall enough, keep your head against the back rest. (cid:2) Don’t wiggle or squirm in an effort to press the weights up.\\n\\nFigure 14-9: The dumbbell shoulder press works out your shoulders, triceps, and upper back.\\n\\na\\n\\nb\\n\\nPhotograph by Sunstreak Productions, Inc.\\n\\n226 Part IV: Lift and Curl: Building a Stronger Bod with Weights\\n\\nGym alternative: Shoulder-press machine Set your seat height so that the shoulder-press machine’s pulley is even with the middle of your shoulder. Hold onto each of the front handles (see Figure 14-10). Pull your abdominals in tight, but allow a slight natural gap to remain between the small of your back and the back pad.\\n\\nPress the handles up without locking your elbows. Lower your arms until your elbows are slightly lower than your shoulders.\\n\\nFigure 14-10: Try the shoulder- press machine as an alternative to the dumbbell shoulder press.\\n\\nPhotograph by Sunstreak Productions, Inc.\\n\\nExternal and internal rotation exercises External and internal rotation exercises target your rotator-cuff muscles but strengthen your shoulder muscles as well. If these movements bother your neck, try resting your head on your outstretched arm.\\n\\nGetting set Hold a dumbbell in your right hand and lie on the floor on your left side. Bend your right elbow to a 90-degree angle and tuck it firmly against your side so that your palm is facing downward. Pull your abdominals in. Bend your left elbow and rest the side of your head in your left hand (see Figure 14-11a).\\n\\nChapter 14: Designing a Strength-Training Program\\n\\n227\\n\\na\\n\\nFigure 14-11: Rotation works your rotator-cuff muscles.\\n\\nb\\n\\nPhotograph by Sunstreak Productions, Inc.\\n\\nThe exercises Keeping your right elbow glued to your side, raise your right hand as far as you comfortably can. Slowly lower the weight back toward the floor. This exercise is external rotation. After you complete all the repetitions, switch the weight to your left hand and lie on your back (refer to Figure 14-11b). (You can also do this exercise lying on one side on the bench, with your forearm hanging off the bench.) Bend your elbow so your forearm is perpendicular to the floor and your palm is facing in. Lower your hand down and out to the side as far as you can, and then lift the weight back up. This exercise is internal rotation.\\n\\nTechnique tips Keep these tips in mind as you perform external and internal rotation:\\n\\n(cid:2) Use a very light weight. (cid:2) Imagine that your shoulder is the hinge of a door that is opening and\\n\\nclosing.\\n\\n(cid:2) Keep your wrist straight.\\n\\n228 Part IV: Lift and Curl: Building a Stronger Bod with Weights\\n\\nGym alternative: Cable internal and external rotation exercises Attach a horseshoe handle to the upper cable pulley and grasp the handle with your right hand so that your right arm is alongside the cable tower. Bend your arm so your forearm is in front of your body and parallel to the floor, and your elbow rests against your side (see Figure 14-12). Pull the handle across your body to lift the weight, and then slowly return your arm to the starting position. This exercise is internal rotation.\\n\\nAfter you complete your reps, do external rotation with your left rotator cuff: Without changing position, hold the horseshoe handle in your left hand, so your forearm is across your waist. Keeping your left elbow against your side, pull the handle outward to lift the weight. To lower the weight, return to the starting position. To complete internal and external rotation on both arms, switch to the other side of the cable tower or turn your body around.\\n\\nFigure 14-12: Cable internal and external rotation exercises target your rotator-cuff muscles.\\n\\nPhotograph by Sunstreak Productions, Inc.\\n\\nDumbbell biceps curl The dumbbell biceps curl targets your biceps, the muscles you rely on to hold heavy objects and look buff in sleeveless shirts. Use caution if you have lower-back or elbow problems.\\n\\nGetting set Hold a dumbbell in each hand and stand with your feet as wide apart as your hips. Let your arms hang down at your sides with your palms forward. Pull your abdominals in, stand tall, and keep your knees slightly bent. (See Figure 14-13a.)\\n\\nThe exercise Curl both arms upward until they’re in front of your shoulders (refer to Figure 14-13b). Slowly lower the dumbbells back down.\\n\\nChapter 14: Designing a Strength-Training Program\\n\\n229\\n\\nFigure 14-13: Keep your elbows close to your body while performing the dumbbell biceps curl.\\n\\na\\n\\nb\\n\\nPhotograph by Sunstreak Productions, Inc.\\n\\nTechnique tips Keep these tips in mind as you perform the dumbbell biceps curl:\\n\\n(cid:2) Keep your knees slightly bent and your posture tall. Don’t lean back or\\n\\nrock your body forward to help lift the weight.\\n\\n(cid:2) Keep your elbows as close to your body as you can without supporting\\n\\nyour elbows on the sides of your stomach for leverage.\\n\\n(cid:2) Don’t rest when you reach the top or bottom of the exercise; instead,\\n\\nkeep a constant tension on the biceps.\\n\\n(cid:2) Lower the weight back to the starting position slowly and with control.\\n\\nGym alternative: Arm-curl machine Adjust the seat so when you sit down and extend your arms straight out, they’re level with your shoulders, and your elbows are lined up with the moving hinge or pulley of the machine. Sit down and grasp a handle in each hand with your palms facing up.\\n\\nBend your elbows and pull the handles until they’re just above your shoul- ders (see Figure 14-14).

Place your left lower leg and your left hand on top of the bench. Lean forward at the hips until your upper body is at a 45-degree angle to the floor. Bend your right elbow so your upper arm is parallel to the floor, your forearm is perpendicular to it, and your palm faces in. Keep your elbow close to your waist. Pull your abdominals in and bend your knees slightly.

Sit down and tip the handles back so the hand grips are alongside your shoulders.\\n\\nGrasp a handle in each hand with your palms facing inward. Straighten your arms out in front of you to lift the weight stack, and then slowly bend your arms to lower the weight. (See Figure 14-16.)\\n\\nFigure 14-16: Use the triceps- extension machine at the gym as an alternative to the triceps kickback.\\n\\nPhotograph by Sunstreak Productions, Inc.\\n\\nBasic crunch The basic crunch is the consummate abdominal exercise. Pay special atten- tion to your form if you have lower-back or neck problems. We don’t offer a machine alternative for the basic crunch because we think abdominal crunch\\n\\nChapter 14: Designing a Strength-Training Program\\n\\n233\\n\\nmachines are difficult to use correctly, and we don’t think machines are as safe or effective as abdominal floor exercises. Instead, our alternative abdom- inal move uses a large plastic ball known as a physioball.\\n\\nGetting set Lie on your back with your knees bent and feet flat on the floor, hip-width apart. Place your hands behind your head so your thumbs are behind your ears. Don’t lace your fingers together. Hold your elbows out to the sides but rounded slightly in. Tilt your chin slightly, leaving a few inches of space between your chin and your chest. Gently pull your abdominals inward. (See Figure 14-17a.)\\n\\na\\n\\nFigure 14-17: Curl up to work on your abs.\\n\\nb\\n\\nPhotograph by Sunstreak Productions, Inc.\\n\\nThe exercise Curl up and forward so that your head, neck, and shoulder blades lift off the floor (refer to Figure 14-17b). Hold for a moment at the top of the movement and then lower slowly back down.\\n\\n234 Part IV: Lift and Curl: Building a Stronger Bod with Weights\\n\\nTechnique tips\\n\\nKeep the following tips in mind as you perform the basic crunch:\\n\\n(cid:2) Keep your abdominals pulled in so you feel more tension in your abs\\n\\nand so you don’t overarch your lower back.\\n\\n(cid:2) Don’t pull on your neck with your hands or draw your elbows in. (cid:2) Do curl as well as lift. In other words, don’t yank your head, neck, and shoulder blades off the floor; you also need to curl forward, as if you’re doubling over. Think of bringing your ribs to your pelvis and exhale as you crunch up; inhale as you lower back down, keeping your belly button drawn in.\\n\\n(cid:2) Perform crunches very slowly and with control, doing 12 reps.\\n\\nGym alternative: Ball crunch Sit on a physioball and roll your torso down so that your back — from your shoulder blades down to your tailbone — is resting on the curve of the ball and your head, neck, and shoulders are above the ball. Your knees are bent, and your feet are planted on the floor, hip-width apart. (See Figure 14-18.)\\n\\nPerform the same abdominal curling movement as you do for the basic crunch. You have to move slowly and keep your abdominal muscles fully engaged to keep yourself from wiggling around on the ball or rolling off of it.\\n\\nFigure 14-18: You can perform the basic- crunch movement on a physioball as an alternative to the traditional exercise.\\n\\nPhotograph by Sunstreak Productions, Inc.\\n\\nChapter 14: Designing a Strength-Training Program\\n\\n235\\n\\nBack extension The back extension both stretches and strengthens your lower back. It’s the perfect complement to the basic crunch to develop a strong, balanced mid- section. Use caution if you have a lower-back problem or experience lower- back pain while performing this exercise. If you do feel pain, try lifting only your legs and leaving your arms flat on the floor.\\n\\nGetting set Lie on your stomach, facedown, arms straight out in front of you, palms down, and legs straight out behind you. Pull your abs in, as if you’re trying to create a small space between your stomach and the floor. (See Figure 14-19a.)\\n\\na\\n\\nFigure 14-19: The back extension stretches and strengthens your lower back.\\n\\nb\\n\\nPhotograph by Sunstreak Productions, Inc.\\n\\n236 Part IV: Lift and Curl: Building a Stronger Bod with Weights\\n\\nThe exercise Lift your left arm and right leg about 1 inch off the floor, and stretch out as much as you can (refer to Figure 14-19b). Hold this position for five slow counts and then lower your arm and leg back down. Repeat the same move with your right arm and left leg. Continue alternating sides until you complete the set.\\n\\nTechnique tips Keep the following tips in mind as you perform the back extension:\\n\\n(cid:2) Exhale as you lift your arm and leg, and inhale as you lower them. (cid:2) Pretend that you’re trying to touch something with your toes and fin-\\n\\ngertips that’s just out of reach.\\n\\n(cid:2) Work for precision rather than height. Lift your arm and leg at the\\n\\nsame time and to the same height.\\n\\nGym alternative: Ball back extension Kneel on a physioball and place your hands behind your head. Lean forward and lengthen your body so your torso is resting against the ball and you’re firmly balanced on your toes (see Figure 14-20). Make sure your spine forms a straight line from your tailbone to your neck. Lift your chest upward a few inches, hold a moment, and then slowly lower back down.\\n\\nCross your arms over your chest, pull your abs in, and lower your upper body a few inches by bending forward at the hips. Raise back up, using your lower back, so your body is parallel to the floor.\\n\\nFigure 14-20: Perform the back extension on a physioball to add variety to your workout.\\n\\nPhotograph by Sunstreak Productions, Inc.\\n\\nPart V Cardio-Strength Workouts: Getting the Best of Both Worlds\\n\\nIn this part . . . You find out about workouts that combine aerobic\\n\\neveryone’s short on time, so workouts that combine cardio and strength training are increasingly popular. In Chapter 15, you get a short course on circuit training, one of the most interesting and popular ways to get and stay fit. Chapter 16 introduces you to the many different vari- eties of yoga, an approach that not only calms your mind but also invigorates your body. Finally, Chapter 17 famil- iarizes you with Pilates, a strength and cardio workout that sculpts your body in exciting ways.\\n\\nactivity and strength-building exercises. These days,\\n\\nChapter 15 Circuit Training for Fitness and Fun\\n\\nIn This Chapter (cid:1) Setting up strength-building stations (cid:1) Getting a step-by-step look at circuit training (cid:1) Taking a peek at a sample circuit\\n\\nvascular exercise with strength training. Circuit training includes a warm-up, followed by a succession of strength-building exercises at stations (in between which you walk fast or run), followed by a cooldown. (Note that a station can be just a spot where you do pushups; it doesn’t have to be anything fancy.) You get to decide how long your total workout will be, how many stations you’ll include, and what exercises you’ll do at those stations. Workouts are fun, the time flies by, and within just a few weeks of doing circuits two days per week, most people notice a big difference in the strength of their arms, legs, abdomen, and buttocks. This chapter helps you decide how to set up your workouts.\\n\\nCircuit training is a unique method of working out that combines cardio-\\n\\nSetting Up Stations and Knowing Which Exercises to Do\\n\\nHave you even seen a circuit-training area at your local park: Along a trail, stations appear periodically, and at those stations are instructions for doing push-ups or pull-ups or a variety of other strengthening exercises.\\n\\nYou don’t need to use the stations set up at your local park, though. Your local gym may have a circuit-training class or may have a self-paced circuit routine that you can do on your own time. You can also easily set up stations in your own home. If you have a weight machine, you’re way ahead of the game and can do most of the weight-lifting exercises there. But if you don’t,\\n\\n240 Part V: Cardio-Strength Workouts: Getting the Best of Both Worlds\\n\\ngather up the following inexpensive equipment and set up stations in your exercise room, spare bedroom, (dry) basement, garage, backyard (in good weather), or any other place you can think of:\\n\\n(cid:2) A sit-up mat or thick towel (for sit-ups, push-ups, crunches, Pilates\\n\\nexercises)\\n\\n(cid:2) One pair each of 5-, 8-, 10-, 12-, and/or 15-pound weights (for curls,\\n\\nshrugs, upright rows, punches, and so on)\\n\\n(cid:2) A weight bar with however much weight you can handle for squats (cid:2) A sturdy chair or ledge (for chair dips) (cid:2) A pull-up bar secured in a doorway (for pull-ups, hanging abs) (cid:2) A stairway or step (for step-ups, single-leg squats, toe raises)\\n\\nArrange each of these so that they’re 10 to 20 feet apart; a circle or square can work, but so can a zigzag pattern, as long as you have some room to walk quickly or run between stations. If you need to place the stations closer than this — say, right next to each other — that’s fine. Just do jumping jacks, jump rope, or run in place with high knees for ten seconds between exercises.\\n\\nTo choose which exercises to do at each station, see the following sections, check out Chapter 14 for illustrations of many of these exercises, or — for detailed coverage of all these exercises — get a copy of our book, Weight Training For Dummies, 2nd Edition (published by Wiley).\\n\\nAt each station, you can do several different exercises, as described in the following sections. However, you can easily forget what exercise you’re sup- posed to do when you get to a station, so I suggest putting a sheet of paper at each station that lists, in order, the one, two, or three exercises that you’re planning to doing there.\\n\\nArm-strengthening stations\\n\\nBecause the warm-up, cooldown, and movement between stations work your leg muscles, many people emphasize arm-strength stations in their circuit rou- tines, focusing as many as half of the total number of stations on their arms.\\n\\nThis list is not meant to be exhaustive. If you get results from other arm- strengthening exercises, put those on your circuit. This list is also not meant to imply that you’ll include all these exercises in your circuit. You can pick and choose from the list, as best suits your needs.\\n\\nIf you don’t have the space to store weights, you can also use exercise bands or tubes (see Chapter 20) to do many of the weight-intensive exercises.\\n\\nChapter 15: Circuit Training for Fitness and Fun\\n\\n241\\n\\nDumbbell biceps curl This exercise, as you may expect, works the biceps. Hold a dumbbell in each hand and stand with your feet as wide apart as your hips. Let your arms hang down at your sides with your palms forward. Pull your abdominals in, stand tall, and keep your knees relaxed. Curl both arms upward until they’re in front of your shoulders. Slowly lower the dumbbells back down and repeat.\\n\\nPunches Punches work your shoulders and upper arms. Take a dumbbell in each hand, put each hand in front of its respective shoulder, and stand with your legs wider than shoulder-width apart, abdominals pulled in. Take your right hand, cross it over your body, and punch out to the left. To keep your knees healthy, roll up to your toes on your right leg as you punch out your right arm. Repeat with your left side and vice versa.\\n\\nUpright rows Upright rows work the shoulders. While standing, hold a dumbbell in each hand and put the ends of the two weights together, holding your hands right in front of your thighs. Pull your abdominals in. Keeping the weights together, pull your hands up to your collarbone. Lower and repeat.\\n\\nIf you’ve had any shoulder (specifically, deltoid) injuries, steer clear of upright rows. Instead, do shoulder presses (see Chapter 14).\\n\\nOne-arm dumbbell row This exercise works the lats (the widest part of your back just behind your armpit) and biceps. Stand to the right of your weight bench, holding a dumb- bell in your right hand with your palm facing in. Place your left knee and your left hand on top of the bench for support. Let your right arm hang down and a bit forward. Pull your abdominals in and bend forward from the hips so your back is naturally arched and roughly parallel to the floor, and your right knee is slightly bent. Tilt your chin toward your chest so that your neck is in line with the rest of your spine. Pull your right arm up until your elbow is pointing to the ceiling, your upper arm is parallel to the floor, and your arm brushes against your waist. Lower the weight slowly back down and repeat.\\n\\nPush-ups Push-ups work all the upper-body muscles. Facing the ground, rest your body on your hands and tiptoes, and keep your back and legs perfectly straight. Pull in your abdominals, lower your chest to the ground, and raise your chest back up again by pushing against the ground until your elbows are nearly locked. Repeat. As push-ups become easier for you, try elevating your feet, which makes this exercise much harder.\\n\\n242 Part V: Cardio-Strength Workouts: Getting the Best of Both Worlds\\n\\nPull-ups Pull-ups work all the upper-body muscles. For this exercise, you need a bar that can hold your body weight. Place your hands (palms facing away) wider than your shoulders on the bar and hang. To do one pull-up, pull yourself up until your chin reaches over the top of the bar. Lower yourself to the hanging position and repeat. Don’t be surprised if, on your first attempt, you can do only one pull-up (or, maybe, not even one!). With repeated attempts, you’ll quickly improve.\\n\\nShrugs Shrugs work your trapezius and upper-back muscles. Plant your feet shoulder- width apart. Take a dumbbell in each hand, relax your arms by letting them hang down at your sides, and relax your shoulders. Pull in your abdominals. Without bending your elbows, raise and lower your shoulders. Repeat.\\n\\nDumbbell chest press Working the chest, triceps, and shoulders, this exercise is an all-time favorite. Lie on a bench with a dumbbell in each hand and your feet flat on the floor. Push the dumbbells up so that your arms are directly over your shoulders and your palms up. Pull your abdominals in, and tilt your chin toward your chest. Lower the dumbbells down and a little to the side until your elbows are in line with or just slightly below your shoulders. The weights should be directly above the elbow joints, which should create a 90-degree angle. Push the weights back up in a triangular motion to where the weights are directly above your chest, taking care not to lock your elbows or allow your shoulder blades to rise off the bench. Repeat. You can also substitute the bench press if you have a weight machine handy.\\n\\nDumbbell shoulder press Shoulder presses work your shoulders, as well as your triceps and upper back. Hold a dumbbell in each hand and sit on a bench with back support. Plant your feet firmly on the floor about hip-width apart. Bend your elbows and raise your upper arms to shoulder height so that the dumbbells are at ear level. Pull your abdominals in so that there is a slight gap between the small of your back and the bench. Place the back of your head against the pad. Push the dumbbells up and in until the ends of the dumbbells touch lightly directly over your head, and then lower the dumbbells back to ear level. Repeat.\\n\\nTriceps dips Triceps dips really work your triceps; in fact, you may find that you can do only one or two dips the first time you attempt this exercise. Use a sturdy chair, ledge, or seat of a weight bench. Extend your legs with your heels on the ground and rest your hands on the outside edge of the chair with your elbows\\n\\nChapter 15: Circuit Training for Fitness and Fun\\n\\n243\\n\\nlocked. Pull in your abdominals; keep your shoulders back, down, and not rounded; and pull your chest up. Bending your elbows, lower your butt to the ground and then push yourself back up until your elbows lock again. Repeat.\\n\\nIf you find that you can’t lower yourself all the way to the ground and still come back up, lower just half the distance to the ground and do as many that way as you can.\\n\\nTriceps kickback Not to be exceedingly obvious, but this exercise works your triceps! Stand to the right of your weight bench, holding a dumbbell in your right hand with your palm facing in. Place your left lower leg and your left hand on top of the bench. Lean forward at the hips until your upper body is at a 45-degree angle to the floor. Bend your right elbow so that your upper arm is parallel to the floor, your forearm is perpendicular to it, and your palm faces in. Keep your elbow close to your upper arm. Pull your abdominals in and relax your knees. Keeping your upper arm still, straighten your elbow behind you until your entire arm is parallel to the floor and one end of the dumbbell points down. Slowly bend your arm to lower the weight. Repeat. On the second circuit, do the exercise with your left arm.\\n\\nLeg-strengthening stations\\n\\nBecause your warm-up, cooldown, and travel between stations is leg-intensive, you don’t need to include a lot of leg-strengthening exercises in your circuit routine. The exercises in this section, however, are some of our favorites.\\n\\nIf you have a weight bench with attachments at your disposal, you can add leg extensions, leg curls, leg presses, and any other exercises the machine supports.\\n\\nStep-ups Step-ups work nearly every muscle in your leg, as well as your butt muscles. To do this exercise, you need a step — one of the steps on the bottom of a stairway can work well. However, buying a step-aerobics platform and placing two sets of risers underneath the platform (to a height of 10 to 12 inches) may be more convenient (because it’s portable). You simply keep walking or running up and down the one step. Step up on one step and then bring the other leg up on that step, too. Then step back down, following with the other leg. Then up the step again, then back down, and so on.\\n\\nSingle-leg squats Single-leg squats work your butt and upper legs and help develop balance. Stand on your right leg at the edge of the step, so that the instep of your right foot comes right to the edge of the step and your left leg is dangling off the\\n\\n244 Part V: Cardio-Strength Workouts: Getting the Best of Both Worlds\\n\\nstep. Pull in your abdominals and bend your right leg on the step at the knee as you push your hips back, sinking into your right heel, until the heel of your left leg just touches the ground. Lead with your right heel, not your toes; straighten the leg on the step. Repeat. On the second circuit, use the other leg.\\n\\nThe heels of both feet should be along the same horizontal line. Also, you may need to hang on to something (perhaps a railing) to keep yourself from falling.\\n\\nStanding calf raise Standing calf raises work your calves and shins and help develop balance. Stand on the edge of a step or, if you have a step-aerobics platform, place two sets of risers underneath the platform. Stand tall with your abdominals pulled in, the balls of your feet firmly planted on the step, and your heels hanging over the edge. Rest your hands against a wall or a sturdy object for balance. Raise your heels a few inches above the edge of the step so you’re on your tiptoes. Hold the position for a moment, and then lower your heels below the platform, feeling a stretch in your calf muscles. Repeat. On the second circuit, use the other leg.\\n\\nIf you find one-legged calf raises too challenging at first, try doing this exercise with both legs.\\n\\nAbdomen, butt, and lower-back strength stations\\n\\nThese exercises help you develop great abs, a nice tush, and a healthy lower back. This list is not anywhere near all-inclusive, however. In fact, setting up Pilates stations to work your core is an excellent circuit-training option. For a brief introduction to Pilates, check out Chapter 17. To get the full lowdown, pick up a copy of Pilates For Dummies by Ellie Herman (published by Wiley).\\n\\nBasic crunch Crunches primarily work the upper region of the abs. Lie on your back with your knees bent and feet flat on the floor, hip-width apart. Place your hands extended out toward your knees, across your chest, above your head, or behind your head so your thumbs are behind your ears — depending on what’s comfortable for you. Don’t lace your fingers together. Hold your elbows out to the sides but rounded slightly in. Tilt your chin slightly, leaving a few inches of space between your chin and your chest. Gently pull your abdomi- nals inward. Curl up and forward so that your head, neck, and shoulder blades lift off the floor. Hold for a moment at the top of the movement and then lower slowly back down. Repeat.\\n\\nChapter 15: Circuit Training for Fitness and Fun\\n\\n245\\n\\nLeg raises Leg raises work primarily the lower portion of the abs. Lie on your back and place your hands, palms down, under the area where your pelvis and lower back meet. (Find a spot where your hands are comfortable.) Pull in your abdominals. Raise your legs (your knees can be slightly bent) about 12 inches off the floor and hold. Lower your legs to just barely above the floor, and then raise them again to 12 inches. Repeat.\\n\\nHanging abs Hanging abs work the lower region of the abs. Using a pull-up bar or hanging- ab apparatus (ask about it at your gym), hang from the bar, pull in your abdominals, and then lift your knees toward your chest, tucking the pelvis under and causing your spine to round. Lower your legs slowly back to the hanging position. Repeat.\\n\\nObliques curls These curls work the obliques, the sides of your core area midsection. Lie on your right side with your arms crossed in front of you. Bending sideways at your waist, lift your upper body off the ground a few inches. You may need to brace your feet under a bar or sturdy piece of furniture. Repeat. On your second circuit, lie on your left side.\\n\\nBack extension Back extensions are a great exercise for your lower back. Lie on your stom- ach, looking down at the floor, arms straight out in front of you, palms down, and legs straight out behind you. Pull your abs in, as if you’re trying to create a small space between your stomach and the floor. Lift your left arm and right leg about 1 inch off the floor, and stretch out as much as you can. Hold this position for five slow counts and then lower your arm and leg back down. Repeat the same move with your right arm and left leg. Continue alternating sides until you complete the set.\\n\\nSquat Squats work your butt and upper legs. Either with your hands on your hips or holding dumbbells with your arms down at your sides (you can also hold your arms out in from of your torso or your fists in at your chest to create a counterbalance, or put them in the overhead position to challenge your posture), stand with your feet as wide apart as your hips and place your weight slightly back on your heels. Let your arms hang down at your sides. Pull your abdominals in and stand tall with square shoulders. Sit back and down, as if you’re sitting into a chair. Lower as far as you can without leaning your upper body more than a few inches forward. Don’t lower any farther than the point at which you’re parallel to the floor, and don’t allow your knees to shoot out in front of your toes. When your thighs are parallel to the floor, straighten your legs and stand back up. Don’t lock your knees at the top of the movement.\\n\\n246 Part V: Cardio-Strength Workouts: Getting the Best of Both Worlds\\n\\nLunge Lunges are amazing for your butt, hips, and upper legs. Stand upright with your feet shoulder-width apart. Take a large step forward, and plant your foot on the ground. Keeping your front knee completely stable and your upper body perfectly vertical, lower your body straight down until your back knee nearly touches the ground. Raise your body straight up and repeat with another step. Keep repeating.\\n\\nDon’t allow your torso to lean forward and be sure to evenly distribute your body weight on both legs. Think of your torso as having a pole placed directly down the center, like a horse on a merry-go-round and go up and down, not back and forth. Also keep in mind that the farther you step out, the more emphasis is placed on the butt and hamstrings; the more shallow your step, the more emphasis is placed on the quads. Finally, when you’re in the down position, both knees should form a 90-degree angle, and you should be able to see the tip of your shoe or toes.\\n\\nMoving through Sample Stations\\n\\nThe beauty of circuit training is that you can set up the stations any way you want, using only a few of the exercises in this chapter, all of them, and/or other exercises from other sources. You can do each exercise once in the circuit, or you can repeat an exercise two or more times in one circuit. Your circuit can include 5 exercises or 25. You get to decide, see what works for you, tweak the circuit, do it some more, and so on.\\n\\nBe sure to arrange your circuit so you alternate stations that use similar muscles. In other words, do an exercise for your abdomen, then arms, then legs, then your back, and then go back to abdomen, arms, and so on. Or, if you want to do an arm-intensive circuit, set up a station for your arms, then legs, then arms, then back, then arms, then abdomen, then arms, and so on. Either way, give your muscles a little time to rest before working them again.\\n\\nHere’s a sample way of ordering the exercises listed in this chapter. This gives you 21 exercises for your circuit. See the following section for step-by- step instructions on how you work these 21 exercises into a circuit-training workout.\\n\\n(cid:2) Triceps kickbacks (cid:2) Basic crunches (cid:2) Dumbbell biceps curls (cid:2) Step-ups\\n\\nChapter 15: Circuit Training for Fitness and Fun\\n\\n247\\n\\n(cid:2) Dumbbell shoulder presses (cid:2) Back extensions (cid:2) Pull-ups (cid:2) Single-leg squats (cid:2) Push-ups (cid:2) Hanging abs (cid:2) Tricep dips (cid:2) Leg raises (cid:2) One-arm dumbbell rows (cid:2) Lunges (cid:2) Dumbbell chest presses (cid:2) Obliques curls (cid:2) Upright rows (cid:2) Standing calf raises (cid:2) Shrugs (cid:2) Squats (cid:2) Punches\\n\\nPutting the Stations Together into a Circuit\\n\\nAfter your stations are set up and you’ve determined an order to follow, follow these circuit-training steps:\\n\\n1. For your warm-up, either outside or on indoor equipment, run, walk, cycle, swim, or do any other cardiovascular activity for 5 to 20 min- utes, depending on how much you’re currently working out each day, and how long you want your overall workout to be.\\n\\n2. When you get back, immediately begin your circuit-training workout.\\n\\nYou can stop for a quick drink of water, if you absolutely need it. But don’t walk around or chit-chat with neighbors or anything like that. Do your warm-up, and then go right to the first station, where you want to ease into your first few strength exercises by using slow, methodical movements.\\n\\n248 Part V: Cardio-Strength Workouts: Getting the Best of Both Worlds\\n\\n3. Set the timer on your watch for 20 to 45 seconds (start on the low end, and gradually build up) and before you begin doing an exercise at the first station, start the timer.\\n\\n4. When your watch beeps, briskly walk or run to the next station, set the timer again, and immediately begin doing the next exercise.\\n\\n5. When the watch beeps again, proceed to the next station, and so on.\\n\\n6. Repeat the entire circuit (all the exercises) at least once.\\n\\nYou can do as many circuits as you choose. If you’ve set up five stations with three different exercises you’re going to do at each, and you’ve set your timer for 30 seconds, the circuit routine is going to take you 71⁄2 min- utes, plus walking/running time between stations, so the entire circuit may take you 10 minutes. Given this scenario, you could do three circuits, which gives you a 30-minute workout, plus your warm-up and cooldown, which gives you a grand total of 50 to 75 minutes of exercise! Not bad.\\n\\n7. When you finish the last circuit, immediately begin your 10- to 15-\\n\\nminute cooldown.\\n\\n8. Stretch immediately after finishing your cooldown.\\n\\nChapter 16 All about Yoga: Mind and Body\\n\\nIn This Chapter (cid:1) Understanding asanas (cid:1) Exploring the different forms of yoga (cid:1) Finding yoga classes (cid:1) Looking at a yoga workout\\n\\nHere in the West, we tend to view exercise as way to improve your\\n\\nbody — to strengthen your heart, tone your muscles, and make your joints more flexible. Only in the last ten years or so has the mainstream fit- ness community come to accept what many other cultures have known for thousands of years: Exercise can also be good for your mind.\\n\\nThis realization has spawned a new fitness catchphrase — mind-body exercise — and yoga is at the forefront. We think everyone can benefit from adding a mind-body activity to their exercise repertoires. You can substitute these workouts for your regular program once or twice a week. For example, instead of lifting weights or doing your regular stretching routine, do a ses- sion of yoga. Some mind-body classes are intensely demanding, so make sure that you don’t overload your workout schedule.\\n\\nTake yoga for a while and you’ll become much more aware of your body — how you stand, sit, and walk. Most people begin to see and feel improve- ments in their flexibility, strength, and stress levels after only a few classes. Over the long term, yoga can keep your body looking and feeling remarkably young. Suzanne took a class from an older man who pranced around the room with incredible grace and agility. After class, Suzanne was shocked to learn that the instructor was 80 years old!\\n\\nKnowing Your Asana from Your Elbows\\n\\nDeveloped in India more than 5,000 years ago, yoga consists of a series of poses (known as asanas) that you hold from a few seconds to several minutes. The moves — a blend of strength, flexibility, and body-awareness\\n\\n250 Part V: Cardio-Strength Workouts: Getting the Best of Both Worlds\\n\\nexercises — are intended to promote the union of the mind, body, and spirit. Most forms of yoga focus on relaxation and deep breathing as you perform and hold the poses.\\n\\nYoga classes have a different feel than the usual Western workouts, often including a spiritual element such as chanting or burning candles or incense. (However, many classes these days dispense with the traditional Indian touches and just get right down to the business of kicking your butt.)\\n\\nThe most common misconception about yoga is that you have to be as flexi- ble as Gumby to do it. In fact, there are many, many variations on the poses, and a good teacher can teach you to do them in a way that accommodates your level of flexibility. As you improve, you’ll need fewer modifications.\\n\\nFinding a Yoga Style That’s Right for You\\n\\nThere are many forms of yoga. Most include the same fundamental poses but differ in terms of how quickly you move, how long you hold each pose, how much breathing is emphasized, and how much of a spiritual aspect there is. Some styles offer more modifications to the really bendy and twisty moves, so they’re more accessible to new exercisers and the flexibility-challenged. Others are for people who can already touch their toes with their tongue. If you find that you dig yoga, experiment with some of the different styles. You may find you like one more than the others.\\n\\nHere’s a brief look at the main yoga options.\\n\\n(cid:2) Ananda: Ananda yoga requires less strength and flexibility than most other styles, so it’s a great place to start. The moves are fairly straight- forward, and ananda doesn’t involve much chanting.\\n\\n(cid:2) Anusara: Anusara, a relatively new form of yoga, has a deep spiritual ele-\\n\\nment and a heavy focus on good posture and body alignment.\\n\\n(cid:2) Astanga: Astanga, sometimes called Power Yoga, is one of the most\\n\\nphysically demanding forms of yoga in terms of flexibility, strength, and stamina. You move from one posture to another without a break, so we don’t recommend this style for beginners.\\n\\n(cid:2) Bikram: Bikram, an intensely physical style of yoga, includes a lot of\\n\\nbreathing exercises. The same 26 poses are performed in the same order during 90-minute classes that are usually conducted in a room heated to 100 degrees. (The heat is intended to make it easier to stretch.) If you have high blood pressure, are at high risk for developing heart disease, or already have heart disease, get your doctor’s permission before taking a class conducted in a room at a high temperature.\\n\\nChapter 16: All about Yoga: Mind and Body\\n\\n251\\n\\n(cid:2) Integral: Integral classes involve lots of meditation and chanting.\\n\\nHowever, integral yoga is one of the easier forms to learn because the postures are relatively simple with plenty of modifications offered for the flexibility-challenged.\\n\\n(cid:2) Iyengar: Iyengar yoga instructors must complete a rigorous two- to five- year training program for certification, so the quality of teaching tends to be consistently good. Iyengar yoga involves props such as foam blocks and stretching belts. Instructors pay close attention to body alignment.\\n\\n(cid:2) Kripalu: Kripalu, a less physical and more meditative style of yoga,\\n\\nemphasizes body alignment and breath and movement coordination. There are three stages in kripalu yoga. Stage One focuses on learning the postures and exploring your body’s limits of strength and flexibility. Stage Two involves holding the postures for an extended time, develop- ing concentration and inner awareness. Stage Three involves moving from one posture to another without rest.\\n\\n(cid:2) Kundalini: Kundalini yoga was one of the first “Westernized” forms of yoga. Because it’s designed to release energy in the body, it involves a lot of intense breathing exercises. Most of the poses are classic flexibil- ity exercises.\\n\\n(cid:2) Sivananda: This classic style of yoga is one of the most widely followed in the world and follows well-known poses, with an emphasis on relax- ation and breathing.\\n\\nTaking Yoga Classes\\n\\nMost health clubs offer yoga classes at no additional charge. You can find a wider variety of styles and techniques at yoga-only studios, which charge $8 to $25 per class. You’ll likely also find classes aimed at different experience levels.\\n\\nIf you’re a yoga novice, make sure that you take a beginning class, and don’t try to keep up with anyone else. Yoga can be extremely demanding, both in terms of flexibility and strength. Even if you can bench-press a heavy load in the gym, you may find yourself lacking the strength to hold a yoga pose for a minute. Yoga requires a different type of strength than weight lifting does. For instance, many yoga poses require you to call upon the strength of your abdominals, lower back, and dozens of small spinal muscles that don’t get much action in a weight-machine workout.\\n\\nThere’s no national yoga certification, so we can’t list certain credentials to look for in a teacher. In the yoga world, it usually means a lot if you’ve stud- ied with a certain yogi master, but most people have trouble evaluating this type of credential. Rely on your own judgment and word-of-mouth recommen- dations. A good yoga instructor wanders around the room correcting class members’ techniques and offering variations that allow less-flexible people to accomplish all the poses.\\n\\n252 Part V: Cardio-Strength Workouts: Getting the Best of Both Worlds\\n\\nLearning the ropes: Yoga equipment and clothing find one. If you’d like to try yoga once or twice Yoga doesn’t require a large commitment of without investing in a mat, you can use a thick equipment and clothing. Some people wear leo- towel or blanket. Look for a yoga mat at your tards; others wear baggy clothes; still others go local sporting goods store, yoga specialty shop, without clothing altogether (an option if you’re gym, yoga studio, or at online shops (search for working out at home, but you won’t find many “yoga mat” on Google or some other search clothing-optional classes). engine).\\n\\nThe one piece of equipment you absolutely do need is a yoga mat, one that’s sticky or tacky (that is, nonslip), as opposed to smooth or slip- pery. Look for a mat that’s at least 68 inches long by 24 inches wide — longer is better, if you can\\n\\nUnlike most other fitness activities that require a major investment in footwear, yoga is gener- ally practiced barefoot, although some practi- tioners do wear socks.\\n\\nSome yoga instructors don’t take into account individual differences in fit- ness and flexibility, so it’s up to you to know your own limits. Suzanne learned this lesson the hard way when her sister, Jennifer, a longtime yoga devotee, dragged her to an advanced yoga class. The 2-hour session involved hanging upside down from a rope for 20 consecutive minutes, an activity that was intended to be relaxing but left Suzanne feeling as if her brain was going to burst through her skull. The class also included demanding ham- string stretches that made Suzanne so sore that she couldn’t ride her bike for four days.\\n\\nSome classes may be too spiritual for you if that’s not what you’re after. Liz once took a class in which the instructor asked students to reveal their inner- most fears. Liz didn’t feel like sharing that bit of information with a group of strangers sitting around the room with their legs twisted around their necks.\\n\\nYoga offers an active time-out to energize your body and calm your mind. Most yoga classes end with several minutes of lying facedown on the floor. This come-down time, called shivasana, is low-key enough to make some people fall asleep, but after you get up, you feel recharged.\\n\\nA Yoga Routine\\n\\nThe following sections describe several basic yoga poses; however, these step-by-step instructions are for demonstration purposes only. From here, you want to pick up a book, rent a video, or take a class to obtain guidance on how long to hold these poses, how often to repeat them, and how to com- bine them with other poses.\\n\\nChapter 16: All about Yoga: Mind and Body\\n\\n253\\n\\nYoga For Dummies by Georg Feuerstein and Larry Payne (published by Wiley) discusses most of the poses and includes very helpful photos. Wiley has also published the two following yoga workout videos:\\n\\n(cid:2) Basic Yoga Workout For Dummies, led by Sara Ivanhoe, teaches 12 basic\\n\\nposes and additional modifications to those poses.\\n\\n(cid:2) Beyond Basic Yoga For Dummies, another video led by Sara Ivanhoe,\\n\\nbuilds on the first video with additional poses and challenges.\\n\\nTaking a yoga class is another way to master the many yoga poses that make up a yoga workout. See the preceding section for more on finding yoga classes.\\n\\nEasy pose\\n\\nThis is one of the simplest poses you’ll do — it’s a simple sitting pose in which many workouts begin. Here’s what you do:\\n\\n1. Sit on the floor.\\n\\n2. Bend your knees, keeping your feet flat on the floor, and then wrap\\n\\nyour arms around your knees.\\n\\n3. Pull your knees to your chest to straighten your spine.\\n\\n4. Release your arms when you no longer feel any stretch in your spine,\\n\\ncross your legs, and let your knees drop to the floor.\\n\\nBe sure to keep your head and body in a straight line.\\n\\nForward bend\\n\\nThe forward bend is extremely relaxing, because you stretch your back and legs. Here’s how you do it:\\n\\n1. Start in a sitting position, with your legs out in front of you in a V\\n\\n(whatever width of V is comfortable for you), toes pointed up toward the ceiling.\\n\\n2. Pull up on your butt, so that you’re resting on your pelvic bone.\\n\\n3. Stretch your arms straight up, trying to lengthen your spine as you\\n\\nstretch, and inhale.\\n\\n4. As you exhale, lean your chest forward, keeping your back straight.\\n\\n5. Try to bring your chin to your shins and your chest to your thighs, as\\n\\nshown in Figure 16-1.\\n\\n254 Part V: Cardio-Strength Workouts: Getting the Best of Both Worlds\\n\\na.\\n\\nb.\\n\\nFigure 16-1: Forward bend.\\n\\nc.\\n\\nPhotograph by Blaine Michioka/Rainbow Photography\\n\\nChild’s pose\\n\\nThis move stretches your lower back and arms and relaxes your entire body. If you have knee problems, lower yourself into position with extra care. Here’s what to do:\\n\\n1. Start in a kneeling position.\\n\\n2. Drop your butt toward your heels as you stretch the rest of your body\\n\\ndown and forward.\\n\\n3. In the fully stretched position, rest your arms in a relaxed position\\n\\nalong the floor, rest your stomach comfortably on top of your thighs, and rest your forehead on the mat (see Figure 16-2).\\n\\nYou should feel a mild stretch in your shoulders and buttocks and down the length of your spine and arms.\\n\\nEase into this stretch by keeping your shoulders and neck relaxed. Don’t force your derriere to move any closer to your heels than is comfortable.\\n\\nChapter 16: All about Yoga: Mind and Body\\n\\n255\\n\\nFigure 16-2: Child’s pose.\\n\\nPhotograph by Sunstreak Productions, Inc.\\n\\nSage twist\\n\\nThis unique pose rotates the spine from left to right, toning and relaxing as you go. Here’s what to do:\\n\\n1. Start in the sitting position and extend both legs forward.\\n\\n2. Bend your right knee and place your right foot on the floor, next to\\n\\nyour inside left thigh.\\n\\n3. Place your right hand on the floor behind you, palm down.\\n\\n4. Take your left palm and wrap it around the outside of your right knee\\n\\n(see Figure 16-3).\\n\\n5. Inhale, extending and lifting your spine upward; exhale and twist\\n\\nyour torso and head to your right side (see Figure 16-3).\\n\\nCat pose\\n\\nThe cat tilt elongates your spine and eases tension in your back. Try it by fol- lowing these steps:\\n\\n1. Rest on your hands and knees, with your belly facing the floor.\\n\\n2. Inhale deeply.\\n\\n3. Exhale and pull in your abdominal muscles, tailbone, and butt.\\n\\n4. Pressing down on your hands, press your back toward the ceiling so\\n\\nyour spine rounds, as shown in Figure 16-4.\\n\\n256 Part V: Cardio-Strength Workouts: Getting the Best of Both Worlds\\n\\nFigure 16-3: Sage twist.\\n\\nPhotograph by Blaine Michioka/Rainbow Photography\\n\\nFigure 16-4: Cat pose.\\n\\nPhotograph by Blaine Michioka/Rainbow Photography\\n\\nTriangle pose\\n\\nMoving from a sitting or lying position to standing, the triangle pose stretches your spine and abdomen. Here’s how you do it:\\n\\n1. Stand with your feet much wider than your shoulders, and place both\\n\\narms straight out to the side, parallel to the floor, with palms facing up.\\n\\nBoth feet can sit flat on the floor, or you can point your left foot, keeping your heel off the floor.\\n\\nChapter 16: All about Yoga: Mind and Body\\n\\n257\\n\\n2. Inhale deeply.\\n\\n3. Exhale and bend to the right, as shown in Figure 16-5.\\n\\nKeep your knees straight and your hips facing forward. Don’t twist your lower body; simply bend at your waist.\\n\\nFigure 16-5: Triangle pose.\\n\\na.\\n\\nb.\\n\\nPhotograph by Blaine Michioka/Rainbow Photography\\n\\n4. Slide your right arm down your right leg as you bend, and then hold\\n\\nyour leg or ankle.\\n\\n5. Hold this position, slowly breathing in and out several times.\\n\\nIf you’re able to, now lift your left leg off the floor, anywhere from 3 to 18 inches, keeping your knee straight.\\n\\nSun salutation\\n\\nThis move stretches your abdominal, lower-back, front-hip, and thigh mus- cles. If you’re prone to lower back pain, make a special point of tightening your abdominals, and don’t arch your lower back. Here’s how to do it:\\n\\n1. Kneel on the floor and then bring your left leg forward so that your\\n\\nfoot is flat on the floor, your knee is bent, and your thigh is parallel to the floor.\\n\\n2. Lift your arms straight up with your palms facing in.\\n\\n3. Pull your abdominals gently inward, and keep your shoulders down\\n\\nand back.\\n\\n258 Part V: Cardio-Strength Workouts: Getting the Best of Both Worlds\\n\\n4. Look to the ceiling, and as you stretch upward with your upper body, push your weight slightly forward from your hips into your front thigh (see Figure 16-6).\\n\\nYou should feel this stretch travel through your torso and upper body, including your arms. You should also feel it at the very top of your back thigh. Repeat with your right leg forward.\\n\\nFigure 16-6: Sun salutation.\\n\\nPhotograph by Sunstreak Productions, Inc.\\n\\nKeep in mind the following tips as you perform the sun salutation:\\n\\n(cid:2) Hold onto something solid, like a sturdy chair, with one hand if you have\\n\\ntrouble maintaining balance.\\n\\n(cid:2) Don’t lean so far forward that your front knee moves in front of your toes. (cid:2) Don’t arch your lower back.\\n\\nChapter 17 Pilates: Sculpting and Strengthening\\n\\nIn This Chapter (cid:1) Getting the lowdown on Pilates (cid:1) Going back to school (cid:1) Looking at a basic Pilates workout\\n\\ncarpenter and gymnast who invented the technique for injured dancers. Many of the moves were inspired by yoga or patterned after the movements of zoo animals such as swans, seals, and big cats.\\n\\nFirst things first: This form of exercise is not pronounced pie-lates but\\n\\nrather pih-lah-teez. It’s named after its inventor, Joseph Pilates, a former\\n\\nZoo animals aside, this chapter gives you a quick overview of Pilates, from understanding how it works to finding a gym or video, to taking a stab at a quick workout.\\n\\nUnderstanding How Pilates Works\\n\\nPilates tends to emphasize your body’s core, that is, the abdomen, obliques, lower back, inner and outer thigh, butt, and so on. For this reason, Pilates develops much of what exercisers need — strength, flexibility, muscular endurance, coordination, balance, and good posture — with a much lower chance of injury than with other forms of exercise. The discipline emphasizes correct form instead of going for the burn. Plus, with so many exercise varia- tions and progressions, we think you’ll have a hard time getting bored with this creative form of exercise. The moves require you to engage virtually your whole body. At times, you may try to strengthen one muscle while stretching another. Pilates moves take lots of concentration; you can’t simply go through\\n\\n260 Part V: Cardio-Strength Workouts: Getting the Best of Both Worlds\\n\\nthe motions like you can on gym equipment. And then, for every move you think you’ve mastered, Pilates has another version that’s a little different and a little harder.\\n\\nConsider a move called “rolling like a ball” (see Figure 17-1): You balance on your rear end, roll backward, and then roll back up into the balanced position again. This move requires a good balance of abdominal and lower-back strength and is deceptively tough. Liz has seen many muscular bodybuilders taken down by this move. Pilates teaches you to think about how you use your muscles during your workout so you use them better in daily life. For instance, because much of the focus is on good posture and body mechanics, you stand and sit taller and walk more gracefully. Liz always leaves her Pilates classes feeling a few inches taller.\\n\\na.\\n\\nb.\\n\\nFigure 17-1: Rolling like a ball.\\n\\nc.\\n\\nd. Return to the Balance Point.\\n\\nPhotograph by David Herman and Jordan Levy\\n\\nAnybody can benefit from Pilates. Liz has been taking Pilates classes for years. Although she has always been strong and has plenty of endurance from all the running, hiking, and weight training she does, she continues to find Pilates very challenging.\\n\\nChapter 17: Pilates: Sculpting and Strengthening\\n\\n261\\n\\nFinding a Class or Instructor\\n\\nYou can practice Pilates three ways:\\n\\n(cid:2) You can take a group class that involves performing specialized calis-\\n\\nthenics exercises, with or without a mat (refer to Figure 17-1).\\n\\n(cid:2) You can take private lessons on a series of machines with exotic names\\n\\nlike the Cadillac and the Reformer. The Cadillac, with its array of springs, straps, poles, and bars, looks like a bed that the Marquis de Sade might have enjoyed. The Reformer looks like a weight bench souped up with assorted springs, straps, and pads.\\n\\n(cid:2) You can pick up a copy of Pilates Workout For Dummies, a workout video by Michelle Dozois (published by Wiley), that demonstrates Pilates techniques for beginners but also offers challenging workouts as you advance.\\n\\nAlso pick up a copy of Pilates For Dummies by Ellie Herman (published by Wiley), a step-by-step guide for everything from basic Pilates to super-advanced exercises.\\n\\nThere are nearly 500 Pilates studios nationwide, and the explosion continues. Instructors of the official Pilates Method must complete a rigorous training program that includes more than 600 apprenticeship hours. Other Pilates fac- tions have created their own certifications, which may or may not be as rigor- ous. To find a good Pilates instructor, you’re going to have to rely on your own judgment and recommendations from people you trust.\\n\\nPilates is expensive. Private lessons will set you back $40 to $200 a session. Yes, you read correctly: Some instructors charge $200 for a single session. That’s because there are many more personal trainers who don’t have a Pilates specialization than do, and when they get a following, their prices tend to skyrocket. Mat classes are a relative bargain, running from $12 to $25 per session, but that’s still more than many monthly gym memberships. Some gyms offer Pilates classes to members at no additional charge and offer pri- vate instruction at a discount. If you like to master athletic activities quickly, this may not be the workout for you. Like dance, yoga, and martial arts, learn- ing Pilates is a long-term process.\\n\\nIf you can afford it, we recommend taking a private session or two on the machines. It is both an enlightening and humbling experience — enlightening because you discover that your body can move in ways you never imagined, and humbling because you discover ways your body should be able to move but can’t.\\n\\n262 Part V: Cardio-Strength Workouts: Getting the Best of Both Worlds\\n\\nLooking at Some Pilates Exercises\\n\\nPilates includes hundreds of movements and exercises (and many have numerous steps), and different combinations of these moves make up a Pilates workout. Because of a lack of space, however, we can’t show you anything but a small sampling here. But you can get some idea of what a few basic Pilates moves look like, and you can try them in your own living room before shelling out the big bucks for classes and/or equipment.\\n\\nYou may require several weeks to become comfortable with your Pilates workout, and several months to become skilled at it. It’s a difficult activity, but one that pays off handsomely if you stick with it.\\n\\nUpper-abdominal curls\\n\\nMany people struggle with abdominal curls, usually because of weak abs. Although you may struggle at first to do this exercise, by staying with it, you encourage a strong core.\\n\\n1. Lie on your back with your knees bent, feet flat on the floor, and your\\n\\nfingers behind your head, as shown in Figure 17-2.\\n\\n2. Pull your navel toward your spine.\\n\\n3. Lift your shoulders just barely off the mat and pull your chin toward\\n\\nyour chest, as shown in Figure 17-2.\\n\\n4. Hold, and then relax and lower yourself to the mat. Repeat eight times. (Okay, repeat only three or four times until you get used to this activ- ity and can handle eight reps!)\\n\\nBridge\\n\\nThe bridge strengthens and stabilizes the core muscles, especially your butt and the back of your legs. Be careful, however, not to arch your back.\\n\\n1. Lie on your back, knees bent, feet flat on the floor.\\n\\n2. Breathe in deeply.\\n\\n3. Exhale and push your feet into your yoga mat, squeeze your butt, and thrust your hips toward the ceiling, forming a straight line from your shoulders to your knees (see Figure 17-3).\\n\\n4. Return to the mat and repeat four times.\\n\\nChapter 17: Pilates: Sculpting and Strengthening\\n\\n263\\n\\na.\\n\\nFigure 17-2: Upper- abdominal curls.\\n\\nb.\\n\\nPhotograph by David Herman and Jordan Levy\\n\\na.\\n\\nFigure 17-3: The bridge.\\n\\nb.\\n\\nPhotograph by David Herman and Jordan Levy\\n\\n264 Part V: Cardio-Strength Workouts: Getting the Best of Both Worlds\\n\\nBasic cat\\n\\nLooking much like a yoga pose (see Chapter 16), basic cat lengthens and stretches the muscles around your spine.\\n\\n1. Start on all fours, hands directly below your shoulders, with a natural\\n\\nsway in your spine (see Figure 17-4a).\\n\\n2. As you inhale, arch your back a little (see Figure 17-4b).\\n\\n3. Exhale, pull your navel in, tucking your butt under and pushing the\\n\\nmiddle of your back up toward the ceiling, and then push your hands into your mat. Round out your back, dropping your head and making your back look like the letter c (see Figure 17-4c).\\n\\n4. Return to Step 1 and repeat three more times.\\n\\na.\\n\\nb.\\n\\nFigure 17-4: Basic cat.\\n\\nc.\\n\\nPhotograph by David Herman and Jordan Levy\\n\\nPart VI Conquering the Gym (Even at Home)\\n\\nIn this part . . . We prepare you to take the health-club plunge — or\\n\\ngoals. Chapter 18 explains how to choose the best gym for you and how to recognize slimy sales tactics; we also update you on the latest health-club trends and share the unwritten rules of the gym: what to say, what to wear, and what to do about that pool of sweat you left on the leg- press machine. Chapter 19 helps you sort through the wide range of classes you’re likely to find — from spinning to kickboxing to circuit training — and also gives you the lowdown on exercise DVDs and videos, including how to build a first-rate library, where to get the best deals, and which instructors to try.\\n\\ncreate the best home gym for your budget and\\n\\nTo create your own home gym, take a look at Chapter 20, which covers the basics: where to shop, how to get a good deal, and where to put your equipment so you’ll actually use it, with special sections that focus on cardiovascular machinery and strength and flexibility equipment. We even tell you which brands and features to look for and how to distinguish the quality equipment from the con- traptions that will collapse the first time you use them.\\n\\nChapter 18 Health-Club Primer: Getting the Most Out of Your Gym\\n\\nIn This Chapter (cid:1) Deciding whether to join a gym (cid:1) Evaluating a health club (cid:1) Going it alone in the gym (cid:1) Asking Miss Manners: Health club etiquette (cid:1) Being the best fitness-class student\\n\\nW hen it comes to health clubs, we’re biased: We like ’em. Liz likes them\\n\\nso much that she’s a member of four different clubs. Suzanne likes them so much that she brings weight-lifting gloves on vacation and always hunts down the nearest gym, even if it’s in the basement of a crummy hotel in Morocco.\\n\\nWe like health clubs because there’s always someone around to give you help and encouragement. You also can get a much wider variety of workout choices than you would in your living room. Of course, to reap the benefits of a health club, you have to actually show up. The reality is, most people don’t. If every member of your gym worked out regularly, the place probably would look like the floor of the New York Stock Exchange. About half the people who join a club quit exercising within two months, and only 20 percent work out three times a week.\\n\\nTo boost your odds of becoming a regular, it’s important to choose a gym that suits your schedule, your goals, and your personality. This chapter covers the latest trends in health clubs and helps you choose the right club for you. And to make sure you pay a fair price, we explain some of the sneaky sales tactics and hidden costs you may encounter. Finally, we fill you in on health-club etiquette and help you move to the head of the class when taking advantage of the fitness classes offered at most health clubs.\\n\\n268 Part VI: Conquering the Gym (Even at Home)\\n\\nShould You Join a Health Club?\\n\\nA health club isn’t for everybody. Before you shop around, consider whether you’re the sort of person who will thrive at a gym. This may save you plenty of money and guilt in the long run. If you decide that a gym isn’t for you, that’s fine. There are other places to get fit (see Chapter 10 and Part V for more ideas).\\n\\nThree reasons to sign up\\n\\nJoining a gym requires a fair amount of guts. It took our friend Chivas Clem two years to venture into his neighborhood health club. “I almost turned around and walked out,” recalls Chivas, who’s a very svelte 5\\'8\". “The room was full of these tanned, perfect bodies in spandex cat suits, and I’m totally emaciated. Finally, I get the nerve to ask this hulk-like man behind the counter if I can join. He says, ‘So, you’ve never been to a gym before?’ I say, ‘No, is it that obvious?’” Don’t be put off by insensitive comments like that. If you’re debating whether to join a gym, remember the following great reasons to sign up.\\n\\nYou need inspiration At home you can always drum up an excuse not to exercise, even if it means dusting your bread maker or reading your VCR/DVD universal TV remote manual. But at the gym, what else is there to do but exercise? Even if you never talk to a soul, you can feed off the energy of those around you. You may even find a workout partner. Some gyms will scout out a buddy for you.\\n\\nYou want variety Even if you can afford $10,000 to build an elaborate home gym, you can still find more options at a health club. At home, you may have a stationary bike, a treadmill, or a stair-climber. At a gym, you have all three and more. The same goes for weights. You can strengthen your triceps just fine with a pair of dumbbells in your living room, but at a gym you also have the option of using machines, barbells, and cable pulleys. Gyms frequently update their equip- ment, so you can try strength and aerobic machines that haven’t yet hit the home market or are still too expensive. You can also choose from a long list of classes.\\n\\nYou want expert advice At a good gym, a trainer is always on hand to help you figure out the chest machine or tell you how to firm up your butt. You also have a room full of other exercisers to watch, although they may or may not be good instructors to learn from.\\n\\nChapter 18: Health-Club Primer: Getting the Most Out of Your Gym\\n\\n269\\n\\nThree reasons to say, “No thanks”\\n\\nSome people collect gym memberships like Elizabeth Taylor collects hus- bands — with about as much success. They figure that if they keep joining, one of these days they may actually go, but inevitably the affair is short-lived. Don’t bother buying a membership if you have no serious intention of using it. If you fit the following categories, you’re better off finding an alternative way to work out.\\n\\nYou want to exercise alone If you can’t bear the thought of working out in public just yet, start off at home and consider a gym again in a few months when you feel more confident. Or, if you’re someone who prefers solitude and uses your workout time to think, don’t waste your money on a health-club membership.\\n\\nYour schedule won’t allow time If you don’t have the time to drive to a club or if you can’t find one to accom- modate your work hours, don’t force the issue. Exercising at home makes more sense. (Know, however, that 24-hour gyms are becoming more popular. Even Kingston, New York, Liz’s hometown, has had one for years — and the place doesn’t even have a Starbucks.)\\n\\nYou hate exercising indoors If indoor workouts make you feel like a hamster in a Habitrail, head outside and walk, run, skate, or cycle. Keep in mind that you have to be pretty cre- ative to get a great strength-training workout outdoors, but if you use your body weight (push-ups, pull-ups), benches, outdoor circuit-training or fitness courses, and so on, you can put together a pretty decent strength workout.\\n\\nKnowing How to Judge a Gym\\n\\nDon’t join a club simply because your accountant goes there or because the club is promoting a special discount. Shopping around before you part with any money is important. Here are ten factors to consider (some may matter to you; others won’t) when judging a gym.\\n\\nLocation\\n\\nThis is probably the most important consideration. If your gym is on the other side of town, you won’t go — even if it’s the Taj Majal of health clubs. Ideally, join a club within a ten-minute walk or drive from your home or office.\\n\\n270 Part VI: Conquering the Gym (Even at Home)\\n\\nThe only exception may be a gym with special facilities that the nearest club doesn’t have, like Pilates or boot-camp classes. But if you’re a beginner who hasn’t yet made exercise a habit, you may still be better off at a nearby club that doesn’t have all the amenities.\\n\\nSize\\n\\nThe big trend here is the super-club — the health club equivalent of Wal-Mart. You can find low prices, an enormous selection of equipment and classes, plenty of energy, and a large staff of trainers. For an experienced exerciser, a super-club can be as fun as an amusement park; you can never get bored, roving from the golf clinic to the climbing wall to the Middle Eastern belly dancing class. Chelsea Piers in New York City has two floors of ice-hockey rinks, a bowling alley, an equestrian center, a gymnastics studio for kids, and a 10,000-square-foot climbing wall.\\n\\nIf you’re a beginner, however, these mega-clubs can be overwhelming. You can get lost trying to find your way from the locker room to the T’ai Chi class. In that case, a smaller, cozier gym may be a better choice. You can get to know the entire staff on a personal basis, and they may even notice if you don’t show up for a while.\\n\\nSuper-clubs tend to take a “jack-of-all-trades, master-of-none” approach. These clubs may have a small yoga room, a limited boxing program, and a small climbing wall that would bore you after a week. If you’re trying to famil- iarize yourself with a specific skill or technique, a mega-club isn’t the place to get in-depth knowledge. Yoga, for example, is best learned at a studio that teaches only yoga. But if you want a smorgasbord of activities, a super-club is the place to be.\\n\\nSome larger health clubs tend to take a “no-frills” approach, which means you may not have a spa, day-care center, pool, and 20 different types of workout classes, but you do have cardio and strength equipment, plus a locker room in which to change and shower. If no-frills is appropriate for you, you’ll pay far less than at a health club that offers all the amenities.\\n\\nCost\\n\\nMembership fees vary greatly. Large clubs often charge less than small ones because they have more members. (They also tend to pay their staff less.) But the dollar figure doesn’t mean everything. Fifty bucks a month may seem outrageous for a small neighborhood club with old equipment; on the other hand, if the club is half a mile from your house, it’s a bargain because you may actually go. It’s a much better investment than a $30-a-month club that’s 20 minutes away.\\n\\nChapter 18: Health-Club Primer: Getting the Most Out of Your Gym\\n\\n271\\n\\nConsider these other money matters when you choose a gym:\\n\\n(cid:2) Hidden costs: The monthly membership may be reasonable, but will you pay out the wazoo in extras? A few years ago, Suzanne checked out a club that cost $25 a month. What the sales guy didn’t happen to mention was the $1.35 daily parking fee. If Suzanne went to the gym five days a week, she would have paid more per month in parking — $27 — than in membership fees. She ultimately found a gym with free parking (a prized commodity in Los Angeles).\\n\\nSome gyms charge extra for specialty classes, such as boxing. Other clubs don’t have membership dues but charge hefty fees for trainers; the catch is, you can’t use the club without one. This type of club could run you $10,000 a year. On the other hand, you’re bound to get plenty of attention.\\n\\n(cid:2) Initiation fees: In addition to the monthly membership fee, many clubs require an initiation fee. At least they claim to require it. If you insist strongly enough, many clubs waive this fee. Or clubs use this initiation fee as a marketing ploy — something they don’t really intend for you to pay. Some salesperson may say, “Just because you seem like a terrific person, and I really want you to get in shape, I’ll waive the initiation fee. But shh — don’t tell my boss. He’ll kill me.” Initiation fees can range from $25 to $1,500.\\n\\n(cid:2) Bargaining: Many clubs make special deals if you ask, although they\\n\\ndon’t advertise this fact. The best time to ask is during slow periods like summer and the end of the month, when clubs are hungrier for sales. You may also get a break if you join with a family member or friend. If you have friends who are already members, ask what they paid; if the sales rep cites you a higher fee, don’t be afraid to say, “My friend Jane Smith paid $30 a month, and I’d like the same deal.”\\n\\n(cid:2) Trial memberships: If you’re unsure about the club, ask for a two-week free trial period before joining, or at least a day pass. Some clubs lead you to believe that you’re joining for only a month when you’re actually paying by the month and joining for a year. This is why you need to read your contract. If you choose to pay by the month, we recommend using your credit card instead of writing a check. The credit-card company can pro- tect you from incorrect charges.\\n\\n(cid:2) Long-term memberships: Don’t even think about it. You don’t know\\n\\nwhere you’re going to be in three years (although some club chains do allow you to transfer your membership) — or whether the club will even be in business. One club in New York was selling lifetime memberships until the day before it closed its doors. Never sign up for more than one year. You may even want to sign up on a month-to-month basis if the club allows it; you’ll probably pay more, but you give yourself an out if the club doesn’t suit you.\\n\\n272 Part VI: Conquering the Gym (Even at Home)\\n\\nFour slimy sales tactics to recognize\\n\\nSome clubs will try anything to rope you in. Be prepared to combat these sales strategies: (cid:2) Limited offers: “You must join right now,” the salesperson may say, “or I can’t give you this special deal. I’m really sorry, but the sale ends today.” The truth is that if you come back tomorrow, the club may offer you an even better deal so that you don’t walk out again. Suzanne’s gym seems to have a membership “special” going on every day of every month. If it’s not the “Valentine’s Day Join-with-Your-Partner Special” or the “March Madness Special,” it’s the “April After-Taxes Special” or the “May Get-Ready-for-Summer Special.” What prospective members may not realize is that these specials aren’t so special. Month after the month, the offers are pretty much the same.\\n\\nmembers — and then inflate the numbers. Liz, of course, refused to participate in this scheme. Watch out: Some clubs try to make you feel as if you can’t go on living one more minute without a gym membership.\\n\\n(cid:2) An answer for everything: If you say that you have to ask your wife, the salesperson may attack your manhood: “What’s the matter? You need her to tell you what to do about your health? Okay, here’s the phone.” Then the sales associate sits there while you make the call. If you say you can’t afford the membership, the salesman may say, “How can you not afford to invest in your health?” Then he’ll whip out the con- tract and keep inching it across the desk toward you. Be prepared to walk out, even as he tells you how insane you are for doing so.\\n\\n(cid:2) Creating fear or insecurity: The sales- person may rattle off death statistics for men your age who don’t exercise, or tell you that women just a few years older than you disintegrate from osteoporosis because they don’t work out. The salesperson may even tell perfectly healthy women that they’re fat. This was a common practice at a gym where Liz used to work as a train- er. The salespeople would try to get the trainers to test the body fat of prospective\\n\\n(cid:2) The bait-and-switch: The newspaper ad tells you one price, but when you go in, the salesperson says, “Oh, that sale ended yesterday, but I can give you this offer.” Or, “You misunderstood the woman on the phone — we can’t give you the first three months free.” Always ask whom you’re talking to so you can name names. Bring the newspaper ad along so you can use it for proof.\\n\\n(cid:2) Cancellation policies: Salespeople won’t always tell you this, but in most states the law requires a three-day cooling-off period. In other words, if you change your mind within three days, the club must refund your money in full. If the club won’t, get your lawyer to shoot off a letter; that should do the trick. Also, ask what happens if you quit three months after joining. Some clubs will refund your money for any reason. But most will offer a refund only if you move more than 25 miles from the club, if you can prove that you have a medical condition that will prevent you from exercising for several months, or if the club stops offering the services promised in the contract (although many even have a way around this).\\n\\nChapter 18: Health-Club Primer: Getting the Most Out of Your Gym\\n\\n273\\n\\nEquipment\\n\\nYou may not consider yourself qualified to judge the equipment at a gym, but even a novice can make some important assessments. If you wouldn’t know a hamstring machine even if you were sitting on one, ask your tour guide specifically about the following factors:\\n\\n(cid:2) Variety: Do you want three varieties of bikes, or will you settle for one? Some clubs have 10-, 15-, and 20-pound dumbbells; at other clubs, you’ll also find 12-pounders, 171⁄2-pounders, and 221⁄2-pounders. Some gyms have a single hamstring machine; others have four, so you can work these muscles standing, sitting, leaning forward, or lying facedown. (cid:2) Quantity: Is there enough equipment to support the membership? You\\n\\ndon’t want your wait for the treadmill to be like the line at the Department of Motor Vehicles. Take a tour at the same time of day you plan to work out, and notice whether the machines are overbooked. Many gyms enforce a rush-hour policy that limits you to 20 minutes on the cardio equipment if others are waiting. This restriction can be frustrating if you’ve planned a longer workout that day.\\n\\n(cid:2) Quality and upkeep: Is the place in a state of disrepair? Is the stuffing coming out of the weight benches? Lots of duct tape is not a good sign. Get on a couple of weight machines and see how smoothly the weight stacks work. Pick up a few free weights and see whether the ends are loose. Listen to the cardiovascular equipment: Are the treadmills loud and whiny? That noise means that the motors need a tune-up. Don’t be afraid to test-drive a good portion of the equipment — or to ask other members whether they feel the machinery is well-maintained. (cid:2) Equipment turnover: Is the equipment older than the anchors of 60\\n\\nMinutes? Or does the club have a new fleet of stationary bikes with built-in heart-rate monitors? Most gyms can’t afford to replace all their equipment every year, but at least 10 to 30 percent of the machines should be new.\\n\\nHowever, you can still break a decent sweat on equipment that’s not state-of-the-art. Sooner Fitness in Norman, Oklahoma, bought the world’s oldest Lifecycle at an auction in 1978, and the machine has been in daily use ever since.\\n\\nClasses\\n\\nMake sure that the club offers what you want, whether it’s the latest and great- est, like Pilates, circuit training, Woga (yoga in the water), or triathlon training, or more-basic strength-training and aerobics classes. (Some no-frills clubs don’t offer any classes.) See whether the classes meet at convenient times. To assess whether classes are any good, ask if you can sample a few before joining. Also, ask other members for their opinions. For more on qualities to look for in specific classes, and to read about trends in fitness classes, see Chapter 19.\\n\\n274 Part VI: Conquering the Gym (Even at Home)\\n\\nMembers\\n\\nIf you’re new to a club, you may initially be intimidated by some of the other members. Our friend John recalls his second day at his new club: “I was in the locker room when this guy with the most perfect body — the biceps, the abs, the whole thing — walked up to the scale and weighed himself. He must have weighed an ounce over what he wanted because he went into a com- plete rage, punched the wall, and then walked away. I looked down at my body and thought, ‘Oh, man. I’m going to be the wimpiest guy at this gym.’”\\n\\nFortunately, John didn’t give up his membership. He soon found out that there are all types at his gym and that the narcissists are easy to avoid. So don’t be too judgmental about the members of your gym. Sure, you may feel more comfortable at some clubs than others; some gyms cater to people over 40, and others attract bodybuilders who could open a door from the hinged side. But people are people, and most of them are nice, even if they look like underwear models for Calvin Klein or Victoria’s Secret. Don’t give the mem- bership factor too much weight, unless you’re joining a gym primarily to socialize.\\n\\nBesides, you may be surprised by who becomes your friend. “The members I was most intimidated by ended up being just regular guys,” says one friend of ours. “One guy had his head shaved except for a rat tail in the back. He looked really mean and scary, but he was a doll when you talked to him. It turned out he was a nurse.”\\n\\nIf you’re a woman and prefer to work out with other women, consider joining a Curves club. Many of the clubs are efficient (read that: small), so that they can be located in small towns and still turn a profit, but they offer a 30-minute total-fitness program in an environment that’s often quite comfortable for women. The focus here is on working out; in fact, you may not be able to do your own individual workout but instead join classes or structured circuit workouts.\\n\\nStaff\\n\\nIf you’re inexperienced, the staff is going to play an important role in your success. Ask the same questions you’d ask when hiring a personal trainer (see Chapter 4). Are the trainers certified by a reputable organization? Are they experienced? Look around: Are the staff members sitting around telling jokes to each other while some poor guy is pinned under a barbell? Is the only visible trainer doing his algebra homework at the front desk? Does anyone acknowledge your existence when you walk through the door?\\n\\nChapter 18: Health-Club Primer: Getting the Most Out of Your Gym\\n\\n275\\n\\nWhen you’re taken on a tour of the club, notice whether your tour guide actu- ally answers your questions, instead of spewing fitness jargon in hopes of impressing you. Suzanne was pedaling on the recumbent bicycle at her gym when one of the sales staff came by with a prospective member. “These are the recumbent bikes,” the sales guy said, to which the woman replied, “What’s the difference between these bikes and the other ones?” The sales guy’s response: “These are different because they’re recumbent.” Ideally, staff members should be able to provide a wee bit more information. (To find out what a recumbent bike actually is, see Chapter 8.)\\n\\nCleanliness\\n\\nIs the place clean and well-ventilated? Pay special attention to the locker rooms: Are the bathrooms spotless, or is it foot fungus city? Open the shower curtains and check the floor, the soap dish, and the walls for gunk and mold. If a club isn’t clean, don’t join — it’s not worth the health risk. Ask how often the cleaning crew makes its rounds. And take a gander at the air vents to see whether they’re dirty or full of mildew.\\n\\nOne club in Florida has banned soap, shampoo, and shaving cream in the showers to stem the tide of lawsuits filed by members who claimed to have slipped and fallen. Although we sympathize with the management, we do wonder what sort of odors emanate from the club.\\n\\nHours\\n\\nThere are 24-hour gyms and gyms that close at 8 p.m. Check your club’s hours, particularly on weekends, when most gyms close earlier. Generally, the larger the club, the longer the hours.\\n\\nExtra amenities\\n\\nCompetition is forcing many clubs to offer more than a Jacuzzi, towel service, and juice bar. A club may organize hikes, ski trips, and softball teams for sin- gles. Or it may offer stress-management workshops and seminars on training for a marathon. Many clubs offer a whole array of spa services. You can treat yourself to a massage, facial, mud wrap, salt scrub, aromatherapy bath, or power shower (a super-strong shower that we personally find a little scary). Prices for these services vary greatly, as does the quality of the services. Remember: Make sure that your massage therapist is properly licensed. (See Chapter 25 for more tips about massage.)\\n\\n276 Part VI: Conquering the Gym (Even at Home)\\n\\nA number of clubs have gone way beyond day care, building full-fledged kid gyms with tyke-sized weight machines and cardiovascular equipment. The machines are obviously smaller and shorter with a host of safety devices to prevent kids from hurting themselves. This is great. It’s never too early to get kids into the habit of exercising (see Chapter 22), as long as you don’t force your 5-year-old into an Olympic training regimen. Some clubs offer exercise classes that the whole family can do together, as well as programs such as teen-only exercise classes.\\n\\nAnother popular service is nutritional counseling, including weight-loss sup- port groups, computerized diet analysis, and heart-disease prevention semi- nars. Prices vary widely, from $250 to over $1,000 for a package of three to ten sessions. Just beware: As with trainers, anyone can call himself a nutri- tionist, so make sure that you’re dealing with a registered dietitian (someone with an R.D. after his name). Most personal trainers don’t have an R.D., even though they may consider themselves nutritional specialists. We don’t think anyone but a registered dietitian should dispense dietary advice, and that includes chiropractors — giving this kind of advice may even be against the law in your state. Don’t let your “nutritionist” hard-sell you any products — including expensive supplements or prepackaged wonder foods that have been designed “especially for your body chemistry.”\\n\\nAt many clubs you can also find medical and rehabilitation services, including sports-medicine doctors, chiropractors, physical therapists, and sports psychologists. Be aware that many of these health professionals may not actually be affiliated with the club; they may simply rent office space on the premises. This arrangement helps the health professionals attract more busi- ness, and it gives the club added cachet. However, you need to check out the credentials and reputations of the doctors and therapists as thoroughly as you would any others. Don’t assume that the club has chosen the most- qualified health professionals; it may simply have picked those who will pay the highest rent.\\n\\nBraving the Gym Alone\\n\\nGoing to the gym for the first time can be stressful, especially if you’re new to working out. But at some point, you have to take a deep breath and dive in. Here are strategies for feeling at ease in your gym:\\n\\n(cid:2) Take a friend. Going to the gym with a buddy can make you feel more\\n\\ncomfortable and less self-conscious. You two can pretend to discuss the stock market while you figure out how to start up the elliptical trainer. (cid:2) Go at off-peak hours. This way, no one will be breathing down your neck to use a machine, and you’ll have more attention from the staff if you need some reminders. Gyms usually are busiest from 7 to 9 a.m., noon to 2 p.m., and 5 to 7 p.m. If you can’t go during off-peak hours, choose the\\n\\nChapter 18: Health-Club Primer: Getting the Most Out of Your Gym\\n\\n277\\n\\nmorning because most gyms aren’t as packed as they are in the evening, and the morning crowds tend to be fairly regular. You’ll get to know other faces, and they’ll get to know yours.\\n\\nMonday is always the busiest day in any gym — everyone’s trying to atone for sins they committed over the weekend, like eating too many Ding Dongs. Things trail off by Thursday or Friday (but don’t wait until then to work out).\\n\\n(cid:2) Don’t feel embarrassed if you can’t lift much weight. Hey, you’re a beginner. Besides, using only one plate on a weight machine doesn’t mean you’re lifting nothing. Plates weigh anywhere from 5 to 20 pounds.\\n\\n(cid:2) Don’t overdo it. If you push too hard, you may feel so sore that you won’t want to come back. The morning after your first few workouts, you should wake up feeling a little achy and tender — but not so sore that you can’t stand upright. The discomfort usually is at its worst about 48 hours after your workout — a phenomenon known as Delayed Onset Muscle Soreness. Don’t be alarmed: Most people are sore after their first workouts, even if they’re careful. This is because your muscles aren’t used to the extra work.\\n\\nDelayed Onset Muscle Soreness is caused by microscopic tears in the muscles that you exercise. These tears fill up with fluids and waste prod- ucts, and until the muscles recover, you’re going to be in a little pain. The good news is that, after the muscles repair themselves, they’re stronger and harder to tear. So after a few weeks of working out, you won’t get really sore except after especially tough workouts.\\n\\n(cid:2) Don’t expect to master the equipment right away. You can’t learn\\n\\nItalian in a week, right? It takes a while to become proficient with the vocabulary, customs, and nuances of exercise as well. Even if you’ve spent several sessions with a trainer, you’re not likely to remember how to use each and every machine. Refer to your notes, ask a member of the gym staff for help.\\n\\n(cid:2) Make friends. Knowing other members can give you more encourage- ment. One good way to meet someone is to ask for a spot — in other words, ask somebody to assist you while you do a weight-lifting exercise. Smile and look approachable. Someone may ask you to spot him. For instructions on how to spot and be spotted, see Chapter 13.\\n\\nIn general, when you talk to people at the gym, stick to topics related to working out. Ask if they’re done using a particular machine or bench. Ask how to do a certain exercise. The worst approach is to go up to people in the locker room when they’re naked, stick your hand out, and introduce yourself.\\n\\n(cid:2) Don’t worry about people staring at you. Most people are far too\\n\\nabsorbed in their own workout to pay attention to anyone else. But if you really want to block out your fellow gym members, wear head- phones; you don’t even need to turn them on. Just make sure your headphone wires don’t get caught in any weight machines.\\n\\n278 Part VI: Conquering the Gym (Even at Home)\\n\\n(cid:2) Wear comfortable clothes. Go for maximum comfort and minimum\\n\\nembarrassment, but don’t wear anything so baggy that it impedes your movement or can possibly get caught in some moving part. Don’t wear something that exposes you to the world when you climb on some strange contraption. You may end up spreading your legs in front of 30 strangers, none of whom are your gynecologist or proctologist.\\n\\n(cid:2) Ask for help if you need it. Liz knew a guy who was pretty proud of him- self for finally making it to the gym. He got through his first workout only to slice his Achilles tendon on the shower door. He lay there in agony for quite a while before calling for help because he was so embarrassed, not to mention naked. The injury required six stitches, and the guy hobbled around on crutches for six weeks. It took several weeks after that for the staff to coax him back to the gym. He finally returned, although he now takes his showers at home.\\n\\nHealth-Club Etiquette: The Unwritten Rules\\n\\nEvery type of club has its own customs, like the secret handshake you and your buddies used back in fourth grade. Or the secret code word that Howard Cunningham used to get into the Leopard Lodge on Happy Days. Health clubs don’t have secret code words, of course, but you may feel more at home if you know a few of the unwritten rules. Here are some tips on how to act in certain situations:\\n\\n(cid:2) If someone’s using the weight machine that you want, ask whether you can work in. That’s a term for alternating sets with another person. Asking to work in is perfectly legitimate; no one has the right to camp out at one weight machine for a half-hour.\\n\\nWorking in with someone is convenient if all you have to do is switch the pin in the weight stack. But it’s awkward if you have to readjust the seat or add or subtract weight plates. In those cases, waiting until the person is done is a better choice.\\n\\n(cid:2) If someone is standing over your shoulder waiting to use the machine that you’re on, kindly ask that person to work in with you. Or tell the person how much longer you plan to use the machine. Say something like, “This is my last set. Then it’s all yours.”\\n\\n(cid:2) If you need help adjusting a machine or you forget how to use it, turn to a staffer or a gym member with a kind face and say, “I’m new here. Can you help me?”\\n\\nChapter 18: Health-Club Primer: Getting the Most Out of Your Gym\\n\\n279\\n\\n(cid:2) If someone’s doing an exercise that you want to learn, find an appro- priate break in that person’s workout and ask him to show you the exercise. Most people are happy to help — in fact, they’ll probably be flattered that you asked.\\n\\n(cid:2) If you aren’t 100 percent sure that you can safely complete your\\n\\nrepetitions, ask someone to spot you.\\n\\nIf you’re embarrassed to ask for a spot, think about a guy named Anthony Clark, whose photo hangs on the wall at Dave’s Power Palace, a gym in Carson City, Nevada. Clark lost control while doing a squat (an exercise we explain in Chapter 14). He dumped his barbell forward, and the barbell landed on the weight rack — with Clark’s neck sandwiched in between. Fortunately, Clark’s two spotters came to the rescue, and he managed to survive unscathed. Chances are, this isn’t going to happen to you; after all, the guy was squatting 992 pounds. But the point is, be careful out there.\\n\\n(cid:2) If someone’s hitting on you and the feeling isn’t mutual, heck, we don’t\\n\\nknow. You’re on your own here.\\n\\nMajor no-nos\\n\\nMost of the following rules are common sense, but they’re violated so frequently that we feel compelled to mention them.\\n\\n(cid:2) Don’t forget your towel. No one likes to sit down in a pool of sweat.\\n\\nAlways wipe off your equipment after you finish.\\n\\n(cid:2) Don’t fill up your entire water bottle when someone else is waiting for the drinking fountain. Let the other guy get his drink and then resume filling up your bottle.\\n\\n(cid:2) Don’t grunt. You may as well announce over the loudspeaker, “Hey, everyone, look over here! I’m lifting more weight than I can handle!” (cid:2) Don’t leave your dumbbells on the floor. Always put weights back on the rack and in the right order. Don’t stick the 15-pound dumbbells where the 10-pounders are supposed to go.\\n\\n(cid:2) Don’t leave barbells or machines loaded up with weight plates. You\\n\\ncan’t assume the next person can or wants to lift the exact same weight you just lifted. Some men leave the bench press loaded up with a 45- pound plate on each side of the 45-pound bar — as if the minimum any human being would bench-press would be 135 pounds. If you see some- one do this, you have every right to ask him to remove the weights. You don’t have to be all that polite about it, either.\\n\\n280 Part VI: Conquering the Gym (Even at Home)\\n\\n(cid:2) Don’t sit on a machine or bench that you’re not actually using.\\n\\nBetween sets, allow others to work in. And don’t block the aisles between machines, either.\\n\\n(cid:2) Don’t drop your weights from 3 feet in the air. Always place them gently on the ground so as not to simulate an earthquake or crush toes. Now and again, Liz sees a guy who performs a bizarre lift: He sets a very heavy dumbbell on the floor, bends over with locked knees, and snatches the barbell into the air while screaming at the top of his lungs. When the dumbbell is above his head, he lets go of the weight. Needless to say, this is very dangerous and distracting behavior.\\n\\n(cid:2) Don’t interrupt a staff member who is obviously helping or spotting\\n\\nsomeone else. You’d want the trainer’s full attention if you were the one being helped.\\n\\n(cid:2) Don’t spit or deposit gum in the water fountain. Many people don’t\\n\\nquite grasp this concept.\\n\\n(cid:2) Don’t violate anyone else’s personal space. If someone seems to be\\n\\njamming through a workout, that’s not the time to tap him on the shoul- der and ask his opinion on school prayer. This rule applies to the locker room, too.\\n\\n(cid:2) Don’t carry around your gym bag. That’s what lockers are for!\\n\\nAlthough most gyms post signs prohibiting gym bags on the weight- room floor, many people ignore this rule.\\n\\n(cid:2) Don’t “borrow” a gym’s equipment for use at home. Nothing is more aggravating to gym members than looking for a jump rope or weight collar that has mysteriously disappeared.\\n\\n(cid:2) Don’t hog the cardio machines if you’ve exceeded the posted time\\n\\nlimit. We’ve seen people surreptitiously cover the console with a towel while they reprogram the machine, hoping that other people won’t notice their time is up. That’s what we consider the definition of rude.\\n\\nLocker-room rules\\n\\nThe stories we could tell about bathroom misbehavior could fill an entire book. We’ve seen a guy get naked and blow-dry his private parts. We’ve seen people cut themselves shaving and leave a pool of blood for the next person who comes to the sink. We’ve seen people mistake the shower for a restroom. Remember that you’re sharing this space with a lot of other people, so have some consideration! Here are a few rules that should be obvious but, based on our experience, seem to bear mentioning anyway:\\n\\nChapter 18: Health-Club Primer: Getting the Most Out of Your Gym\\n\\n281\\n\\n(cid:2) Don’t take a marathon shower if people are waiting. (cid:2) Don’t leave hair clogging the drain, and don’t leave empty shampoo\\n\\nbottles in the stall.\\n\\n(cid:2) Don’t use more than one locker. (cid:2) Don’t hog the mirror or the blow-dryer. (cid:2) Don’t shake baby powder all over the floor. (cid:2) Close your locker door so the gym doesn’t look as though it’s been\\n\\nburglarized.\\n\\n(cid:2) Throw your garbage in those cylindrical and rectangular objects known as trash cans. Would you really just toss your empty pantyhose package on the floor if you were at home? Okay, even so — don’t do it at the gym. (cid:2) Limit the number of towels you use, especially during busy hours, when\\n\\nthe club is likely to run out.\\n\\nPacking the perfect gym bag\\n\\nYou’ll feel a lot more comfortable at the gym if you come prepared. Using 17 paper towels to dry yourself off after a shower is no fun, although Suzanne has found herself in this situ- ation repeatedly. Some gyms provide towels, cosmetics, even workout clothes. Check with your gym so you don’t overpack.\\n\\n(cid:2) Sweat band, ponytail holder, or whatever you need to keep sweat from dripping into your eyes (cid:2) Shower sandals (cid:2) Post-workout snack, especially if you have\\n\\na long drive home\\n\\nHere’s a list of gym-bag essentials. A bag with lots of zipper pockets helps. (cid:2) Membership card (cid:2) Water bottle (cid:2) Small towel to wipe sweat off the machines (cid:2) Large towel for the shower (cid:2) Padlock for locker (cid:2) Gym clothes (shoes, socks, shorts, tights,\\n\\nsweats, t-shirt, sports bra or jock) (cid:2) Plastic bag for wet, dirty clothes (cid:2) Toiletries (soap, shampoo, deodorant, and\\n\\n(cid:2) Basic first-aid kit, including bandages and\\n\\nantibacterial ointment\\n\\nThese items aren’t vital, but we highly recom- mend them: (cid:2) Weight-lifting gloves (see Chapter 26 for\\n\\ndetails)\\n\\n(cid:2) Personal stereo, headphones, and extra\\n\\nbatteries\\n\\n(cid:2) Reading material for the cardio machines (cid:2) Heart-rate monitor (see Chapter 6 for\\n\\ndetails)\\n\\nfoot deodorant for sneakers)\\n\\n282 Part VI: Conquering the Gym (Even at Home)\\n\\nA Classroom Code of Conduct\\n\\nAn exercise class is a great opportunity to make friends, so don’t blow your chances by annoying the people around you, like the guy who sits in front of you and talks during a movie. Here’s how to keep everybody sweating in harmony:\\n\\n(cid:2) If the class requires a sign-up, honor it. In a group cycling class that Liz taught, a woman signed up, went to the ladies’ room, and then returned to find that her spot had been taken by someone else who had arrived late. The latecomer refused to give the first woman back her bike, and Liz had to use Jimmy Carter–like skills to negotiate a peace agreement between the two women.\\n\\n(cid:2) Don’t walk into a class 15 minutes late and make a big fuss setting\\n\\nyourself up — dragging your step, jump rope, and dumbbells across the room in multiple trips as if you’re unloading a U-Haul.\\n\\n(cid:2) Follow what the instructor says instead of improvising your own rou- tine. If you can’t perform the arm movements in a step-aerobics class, that’s fine — just use your legs; but don’t distract the rest of the class by belly dancing or practicing the latest salsa step.\\n\\n(cid:2) Don’t talk so loudly that no one can hear the instructor. (cid:2) Wear shoes and proper attire. This is for your safety as well as sanitary reasons, and most gyms have strict rules about what’s acceptable and unacceptable. A weight could drop on your foot, or someone could step on your toes. If you wear street shoes, you can damage the floors by dig- ging holes or leaving indelible black marks.\\n\\n(cid:2) Avoid walking in front of the instructor when entering late or leaving early. If you do have to leave early, signal the instructor that you’re okay so that she doesn’t worry that you’re going to the restroom to lie down because you’re feeling ill.\\n\\nChapter 19 Choosing an Exercise Class or DVD\\n\\nIn This Chapter (cid:1) Deciding whether classes are for you (cid:1) Knowing what to expect from your instructor (cid:1) Considering the cost of classes (cid:1) Choosing from among the most popular classes (cid:1) Finding and choosing a DVD (cid:1) Tuning in to our favorite instructors (cid:1) Following some important safety tips\\n\\nExercise classes have made an evolutionary leap since the early ’80s,\\n\\nwhen legwarmer-clad instructors patterned their routines after the dance sequences in the movie Flashdance. Over the last five years or so, there has been a creative explosion in group exercise. In addition to tradi- tional classes like low-impact aerobics and step (which, due to their simplic- ity, are getting harder and harder to find), you can now try strip aerobics, aeroboxing, and power yoga. Even small aerobics studios offer classes such as firefighter boot camp and Pilates. Some classes also have become more equipment-oriented, using dumbbells, tubes, balls, steps, jump ropes — even treadmills, stair-climbers, and rowing machines.\\n\\nAll this variety has attracted exercisers who have traditionally stayed away from classes. Liz recently peeked into a group cycling class and noticed that every bike in the house was occupied by a man. A decade ago, most men avoided the aerobics studio like it was a pedicure salon.\\n\\nExercise classes have matured in other ways as well. For one thing, they’re safer. During the aerobics-crazy ’80s, exercise classes meant two hours of sadistic military drills — and a steady stream of injuries from the ultra-deep knee bends, jerky moves, and high kicks considered criminal today. Classes are better now because most health clubs and aerobics studios require the instructors to have experience and certification. Many clubs audition teach- ers, do regular evaluations, and pay attention to participant feedback.\\n\\n284 Part V: Conquering the Gym (Even at Home)\\n\\nThis chapter covers the classes you’re most likely to find at clubs and studios. The two exceptions are yoga and Pilates, which have become so popular that we devote an entire chapter to each (Chapters 16 and 17, respectively). For each class described in this chapter, we tell you how much you’ll sweat, what you’ll gain, and how you’ll fare if you’re a klutz. Plus, you’ll discover how to get the most out of a class while suffering the least amount of embarrassment.\\n\\nWhy Take a Class?\\n\\nClasses are suited to a certain kind of personality. You’ll love ’em if you feed off group energy or if you enjoy following someone else’s lead. But if you treat exercise as downtime, you may prefer to exercise on your own.\\n\\nBeginners will find classes especially valuable. With luck, you’ll get an instructor who can teach you a few things about exercise, like how to take your pulse properly and how to use good form when you lift a dumbbell. You’ll also develop a certain body awareness that you may not get from walk- ing on the treadmill or pumping weights. You’ll probably make friends, too.\\n\\nClasses are also a great way to learn a new skill. If you want to buy a step for your home, you can get the moves down in a class. Let the teacher correct you so that you know what to watch for when you do the workout alone in your living room. You can supplement this learning process with exercise DVDs.\\n\\nGetting through when you haven’t a clue\\n\\nMake life easier for yourself: Choose classes with the words beginner, intro- ductory, or basic in the title. You’ll get a much different impression of step aer- obics from a slower, simplified beginner class than if you accidentally wander into an advanced class and hear, “Okay, we’re going to U-turn right, U-turn left, electric slide four times, then step, hop, turn, and repeat. Got it? Let’s go!”\\n\\nBefore the class starts, tell the teacher you’re a novice. A good instructor will keep an eye on you and correct your mistakes without making you feel like an idiot. If you don’t mind the spotlight, stand in the front — the instructor will be more likely to notice and correct you. If you’re shy and prefer to make your mistakes more privately, stand in the back or get lost in the middle. Throughout the class, keep your eye on the teacher rather than a fellow stu- dent. And don’t compete with anyone. This isn’t the time to give your ego a workout.\\n\\nIf you get tired, just march in place. Don’t stop cold and walk out in the middle of a class — you risk nausea or even fainting. But don’t be afraid to bail if the instructor is a lemon.\\n\\nChapter 19: Choosing an Exercise Class or DVD\\n\\n285\\n\\nAlways bring a water bottle to class — you’ll drink more often, and you’ll avoid the long lines at the drinking fountain. Finally, come back for more, even if the class leaves you feeling like a clod. Skills and fitness take time to develop. You’ll feel pretty darn good when you master a class that used to wipe you out.\\n\\nWhat to expect from your instructor\\n\\nTry to watch a class before you take one. A good instructor has the class moving in unison and right on cue, even if the steps are complicated. Terry Walsh, the owner of New York City’s Revolution studio, recently taught a pro- motional low-impact aerobics class in Central Park to more than 200 people. Terry is such a good teacher that she had the entire class moving in unison, as if they were a highly experienced, professional dance troop. On the other hand, if everyone’s bumping into each other or several people have stopped completely and are staring off into space, look for another class. No matter what type of class you’re taking, your teacher should:\\n\\n(cid:2) Ask questions at the beginning of the class. Some examples include, “Any newcomers?”, “Anyone with an injury I need to know about?”, or “Is there anyone here who’s never tried step before?”\\n\\n(cid:2) Include a warm-up and a cooldown period. The cooldown should be\\n\\nfollowed by stretching exercises.\\n\\n(cid:2) Give clear instructions so you always know where you are and what’s coming next. Your instructor may say, “Two steps right,” and then point right with two fingers. She should let you know what moves are coming up next instead of springing a traveling grapevine on you at the last minute. She should also rehearse new or challenging moves before the class.\\n\\n(cid:2) Give you plenty of information on technique — but not so much that\\n\\nyou feel overwhelmed.\\n\\n(cid:2) Speak in plain language. The really obnoxious instructors say things like “plantar flex at your ankle joint” — rather than “point your foot.” However, a good teacher should educate you. It’s perfectly okay for an instructor to say, “Feel this move in your quadriceps.”\\n\\n(cid:2) Watch the class rather than gaze at himself in the mirror. He should\\n\\nface the students at least some of the time and occasionally walk around adjusting everyone’s form. Liz once bailed on a step class because the instructor did little other than look in the mirror and watch her muscles glisten in the fluorescent light. She never once turned around to acknowl- edge the existence of the class members, let alone check their form. (cid:2) Do a pulse or intensity check during the toughest part of the workout. This goes for toning and strength classes, too, even if the check is as minimal as asking, “How’s everyone doing?”\\n\\n286 Part V: Conquering the Gym (Even at Home)\\n\\n(cid:2) Make the class fun. You don’t want your instructor to take your classes\\n\\nso seriously that they become a chore.\\n\\n(cid:2) Have an education. It’s a definite plus if your instructor is certified by\\n\\none of the major national fitness organizations: the Aerobics and Fitness Association of America (AFAA), the Aerobics Instructor from the American Council on Exercise (ACE), the Exercise Leader from the American College of Sports Medicine (ACSM), and Group Exercise Specialist from the National Academy of Sports Medicine (NASM)/Reebok. See Chapter 4 for more information.\\n\\nThe certifications for aerobics instructors usually require less knowledge of muscle mechanics than personal training certifications, but they’re more geared toward the skills you need to lead a group, such as motivating students and modifying exercises for different levels. Some specialty fields, such as boxing and Ta’i Chi, are certificates that certified instructors can earn; other specialties aren’t. However, some teachers have aerobics-instructor certifica- tions to supplement their specialty.\\n\\nA word about cost\\n\\nClass fees vary widely. Some health-club memberships include unlimited classes, while others charge up the wazoo for specialty classes that require the instructor to hold a certificate. Aerobics studios charge $5 to $25 per class, sometimes more for certain specialty classes. At many clubs and studios, you can buy a package of classes — say, ten at once — but be sure to find out if you must use up the package by a certain date. Another option is to buy a month’s worth of unlimited class memberships. Some clubs will let you try out a class for free.\\n\\nPopular classes\\n\\nTwo classes that have the same name may be completely different. One body- sculpting class may use dumbbells; another may use rubber exercise tubes. And, of course, no two teachers have the exact same style. Still, every body- sculpting class has a number of common characteristics. The same goes for other types of classes. Here’s a rundown of the most common classes around, roughly in order of their popularity.\\n\\nA recent trend is the invention of quick fitness classes — intense, 30-minute classes that help people sneak in a workout in the busiest of days.\\n\\nChapter 19: Choosing an Exercise Class or DVD\\n\\n287\\n\\nStep aerobics and BOSU What it is: A choreographed routine of stepping up and down on a rectangu- lar, square, or circular platform (or, in the case of BOSU, a domed, flexible apparatus). Many classes combine step aerobics with body sculpting, jump- ing rope, sliding, or funk aerobics.\\n\\nWhat it does for you: Gets your heart and lungs in shape and tones your tush. Step aerobics is a terrific cross-training activity for runners, cyclists, and walkers. BOSU is also exceptional at developing balance and flexibility.\\n\\nThe exhaustion factor: Depends on the choreography, the pace, and the height of your step. In general, the more complex the choreography and the higher your step, the tougher the workout. Never use a platform so high that your knee is higher than your hip when you step up. In some classes, you hold weights while you step.\\n\\nThe coordination factor: High. Even basic classes can confound the choreo- graphically challenged. Higher-impact step and BOSU require major amounts of coordination — some instructors make everything so dancy that you feel like you’re auditioning for a Broadway musical. Clubs are trying to attract the non-aerobics crowd with classes like Stepping for Athletes. (Translation: This is a class for people, like the authors of this book, who are in decent shape but have two left feet.)\\n\\nWho digs it: Most everyone. Step classes and BOSU draw a lot more men than do regular aerobic classes. And women like step because it’s such a great butt toner. However, if you have back, knee, or ankle problems, you may be better off with another type of class — or at least, keep the platform very low.\\n\\nWhat to wear: Some shoe manufacturers (Reebok, Nike, and Ryka, for exam- ple) make shoes specifically for stepping. These shoes have sturdy ankle sup- port, are a bit stiff along the sides, and have plenty of flexibility at the ball and cushioning at the heel of the foot. However, a good pair of aerobics shoes with similar features will suffice. Just don’t wear running shoes. You may stumble if the waffle pattern on the bottom of the shoe catches on the top of the platform.\\n\\nSigns of a sharp instructor: Good instructors ask whether anyone is new to step or has any back, knee, or ankle problems. They accommodate newcom- ers by going over the basics, such as how to place your foot on the platform. Instructors also alert you before every transition — step jargon for any type of change in the routine (such as changing directions). In addition, good instructors make sure that you don’t lead with the same foot for more than a minute or two. The music shouldn’t be so fast that you have to rush your movements to keep up. Instructors should include calf stretches at the end of the class.\\n\\n288 Part V: Conquering the Gym (Even at Home)\\n\\nTips for first-timers: No matter how fit you are, always start with the lowest step — don’t put any risers underneath. Don’t feel intimidated if the guy next to you looks like he’s standing on a coffee table. Also, if you find yourself get- ting confused or behind, forget about the arm movements and concentrate on the footwork for a little while. When step workouts start to feel easy, con- sider adding a riser.\\n\\nBody sculpting and core conditioning What it is: A non-aerobic, muscle-toning class, usually focused on core strength. Most sculpting classes use weight bars, exercise bands, or dumbbells, or a combination of these gadgets. You perform traditional weight-training moves in a class setting.\\n\\nWhat it does for you: Gives you strength and muscle tone and lowers your risk of bone loss, but only if you lift heavy enough weights.\\n\\nThe exhaustion factor: Depends on the instructor, the level of class you’re taking, and how much experience you have with strength training. Prepare to be sore if you’re a novice or if you usually do different exercises.\\n\\nThe coordination factor: Low. Anyone can do this, although it may take a few sessions to learn proper form.\\n\\nWho digs it: Anyone who wants to firm up. Body sculpting and core strength- ening are great if you want to learn the fundamentals before you venture into the gym on your own. We also recommend these classes for people who won’t lift weights unless they’re in a class.\\n\\nSigns of a sharp instructor: Instructors should tell you to use moderately heavy weights so that you don’t do more than 15 reps per set. (We define reps and sets in Chapter 14.) Watch out for instructors who do dozens of rep- etitions with light weights: You’re not going to build much strength or tone that way. (Some clubs still offer a class called Body Pump, which involves up to 100 repetitions for some exercises. Stay away from these classes.) The instructor should correct your form and remind you where you should feel the exercise. Watch for a warm-up and cooldown, too. Some instructors skimp on these essential workout components.\\n\\nTips for first-timers: Prepare yourself for muscle soreness the day or two after your workout. If you want to focus on a particular part of your body, look for a specialty class like Express Abs or Lower-Body Sculpting. Just know that you’ll be strengthening (toning) these body parts, not melting fat off them.\\n\\nCircuit training What it is: A fast-paced class in which you do one exercise for 30 seconds to 5 minutes and then move on to another exercise. It’s like a game of musical chairs: Everyone begins at a station (that is, a place where an exercise is\\n\\nChapter 19: Choosing an Exercise Class or DVD\\n\\n289\\n\\ndone), and when the instructor yells “Time!” everyone moves to the next free station. Some classes alternate an aerobic activity (like stepping or stationary cycling) with a muscle-strengthening activity (like using weight machines). Others focus exclusively on muscle toning or aerobic exercise.\\n\\nWhat it does for you: Increases your strength and aerobic fitness and burns lots of calories. However, you don’t get the same level of conditioning as you would from doing your aerobics and strength training separately. If you take circuit classes, aim to get in an additional 20 minutes of straight aerobic exer- cise at least three days a week.\\n\\nThe exhaustion factor: Moderate. Circuit training tends to be intense, but it’s completely adaptable to the individual. Beginners use less weight and perform simpler moves than more-experienced exercisers, but everyone gets a good workout.\\n\\nThe coordination factor: Low. Nothing to worry about.\\n\\nWho digs it: Anyone looking for a good sweat to shake out of a training plateau. Circuit classes also are popular among busy people who want to combine a strength and aerobic routine in one workout. Anyone who wants a really fun and fast-paced workout will like circuit classes.\\n\\nSigns of a sharp instructor: Good instructors are aware of each class member’s level and modify the moves accordingly. Even though you’re moving quickly from station to station, the instructor still needs to focus on proper technique. Look for no more than a one-minute rest between stations. Expect a heart-rate check 12 to 20 minutes into the main workout. (Checking your heart rate, or pulse, lets you know if you’re pushing yourself too hard or if you’re slacking off. Chapter 6 explains how to check your heart rate.)\\n\\nTips for first-timers: Pay attention to how you feel. Many people are surprised by how challenging circuit work can be.\\n\\nBoot camp These classes are sort of like army training: You commit to eight weeks (one to three days a week), and the instructor works your butt off. We’ve seen all types of boot-camp classes. Some are patterned after the activities firefight- ers use to stay in shape (called firefighter boot camp), such as pretending to duck through a window or chop through a door with a heavy stick meant to represent an axe. Others are Marine-style, featuring endless push-up and coordination drills. Some clubs even offer Ballet Boot Camp, combining ballet moves with traditional aerobics-class movements such as kicks, stepping, and abdominal crunches.\\n\\nIf you’re already in shape, you’ll get even more fit in a boot-camp class. In most of them, you can burn a ton of calories quickly and tone virtually every muscle group in your body. You may also bond with other class members who show up week after week as you do. However, beginning exercisers need not apply.\\n\\n290 Part V: Conquering the Gym (Even at Home)\\n\\nChoose your boot-camp classes carefully. Some are taught by instructors who have more ideas than credentials. Liz hurt her back in a firefighter’s class when she had to drag a 60-pound bag of sand back and forth across the studio a dozen times. The instructor, an actual firefighter, never corrected any of the students’ techniques.\\n\\nKickboxing (also called aeroboxing) What it is: A class that takes the moves of a kickboxer’s training and choreo- graphs them to music. You’ll do some or all of the following: jump rope, shadow-box, forward kicks, punches, and the fancy footwork you see boxers do in the ring when they’re trying to avoid taking one on the chin.\\n\\nWhat it does for you: Develops anaerobic and aerobic fitness — in other words, power and staying power. (For definitions of aerobic and anaerobic, see Chapter 6.) Kickboxing also improves your coordination, agility, and balance. Most classes build muscle strength, too.\\n\\nThe exhaustion factor: Very high. Kickboxers are reputed to be among the best conditioned athletes. After one of these classes, you’ll know why. Most classes are geared toward advanced exercisers, although some clubs offer beginner and multilevel classes, too.\\n\\nThe coordination factor: High. The drills require some fancy footwork and arm work.\\n\\nWho digs it: Anyone looking for a killer workout with plenty of variety, or anyone who hates his boss.\\n\\nWhat to wear: The usual aerobic clothing will do, although some funk-aerobics clothing crosses over into the boxing classes. High-top aerobics shoes are better than running and walking shoes. Cross-trainers are fine. Most gyms supply boxing gloves if they’re used in the class.\\n\\nSigns of a sharp instructor: We recommend classes taught by someone with good kickboxing skills, rather than, say, a step-aerobics instructor who is just futzing around with a few punches and kicks. Some independent kickboxing organizations certify instructors, but most teachers don’t have these certifi- cations. They should, however, have at least one of the usual aerobics- instructor certifications described earlier in this chapter, and they should have attended a few kickboxing seminars.\\n\\nTips for first-timers: Pay attention to how you feel. If a lot of the moves are bone crunching or the exact opposite of what other instructors have told you to do, skip the moves or modify them. Don’t give up. Kickboxing will get easier.\\n\\nChapter 19: Choosing an Exercise Class or DVD\\n\\n291\\n\\nFunk, hip-hop, jazz, ballet, and other dance workouts What it is: An aerobic routine with choreography borrowed from dance moves. Classes range from simple moves with a little attitude thrown in, to what seems like a tryout for an MTV funk-a-thon or the New York City Ballet. At many urban clubs, you’ll find funk aerobics, hip-hop step, and even salsa hip-hop, a funky class spiced up with salsa dance moves.\\n\\nWhat it does for you: Develops heart and lung power and really improves your coordination and agility. You teach your body to move in complex ways and use muscles you didn’t know you had.\\n\\nThe exhaustion factor: Depends on the difficulty level of the class. Some hip-hop classes are geared toward beginners. Others expect you to be in awesome shape.\\n\\nThe coordination factor: High. If you’re a complete rhythm dysfunctional, you’ll have a tough time keeping up. Aerobically, you may not be all that chal- lenged, but you’ll spend a good deal of the class untangling your feet.\\n\\nWho digs it: Anyone with a dance background or anyone who likes dance music. If you’re a Fleetwood Mac fan, you may want to pass.\\n\\nWhat to wear: You can wear your typical sweats and t-shirt, but don’t be surprised if you’re the only one. Funk classes tend to have their own style of dressing: high-top sneakers, off-the-shoulder tops, baggy shorts, sexy bras, oversized socks.\\n\\nSigns of a sharp instructor: Good instructors break down complicated moves into a series of smaller ones before putting them all together. They also show you a variety of interpretations to each move and do the moves more slowly and with less attitude when the class is first learning.\\n\\nTips for first-timers: If your parents didn’t give you the funk gene, definitely take a beginner class and scope out the class first. More than in any other class, novices tend to get left in the dust. But a really good instructor will give enough instruction so everyone can stay together.\\n\\nHigh/low-impact aerobics and stripper aerobics What it is: A traditional dance-inspired routine. With low-impact, you always have one foot on the floor — you don’t do any jumping or hopping. High- impact moves at a slower pace, but you jump around a lot. High/low com- bines the two types of routines. Cardio-striptease is a low-impact workout that combines aerobics with strip-club moves — you’ve gotta see it to believe it.\\n\\n292 Part V: Conquering the Gym (Even at Home)\\n\\nWhat it does for you: Gets you aerobically fit.\\n\\nThe exhaustion factor: Depends on the class. Classes are too varied to make generalizations.\\n\\nThe coordination factor: Moderate to high, especially if you’re a new exer- ciser or if your parents didn’t spring for eight years of tap, ballet, and jazz.\\n\\nWho digs it: Anyone who wants to work out in a group without using any equipment.\\n\\nSigns of a sharp instructor: Instructors should spell out the terminology, rather than just say, “grapevine left, grapevine right.”\\n\\nTips for first-timers: Shop around for a teacher you like who plays music you can tolerate. Music can be a great motivator or a major turn-off.\\n\\nStudio cycling and Spinning What it is: Group classes taught on stationary bicycles. The most popular studio cycling class is called Spinning, a program invented by ultra-distance cyclist Johnny G. and licensed by Schwinn, which manufacturers the bikes used in these classes. Other studio cycling classes go by the name of Power Pacing and Reebok Studio Cycling. Regardless of their names, group cycling classes follow the same basic pattern: You pedal a stationary bike while the instructor talks you through a visualization of an outdoor workout. (“You’re going up a long hill now — you can’t see the top yet . . .”). During the class you vary your pace and intensity, sometimes pedaling as fast as you can, other times cranking up the tension and pedaling slowly from a standing position.\\n\\nWhat it does for you: Burns lots of calories and strengthens your thigh and calf muscles.\\n\\nThe exhaustion factor: High. Most studio cycling classes last 40 to 50 min- utes and are geared toward advanced exercisers. Suzanne’s sister Jennifer was so overwhelmed by her first Spinning class that she left after a half-hour. “All I did the whole time was fantasize about getting off the bike, so I finally just did,” Jennifer recalls. You always have the option of lightening the tension on the bike so that the pedals are easier to push, and you can stay seated while the rest of the class stands. But you may want to hold off on Spinning until you build more stamina on your own. Or take a beginning Spinning class if your studio or club offers one, as most clubs now do.\\n\\nThe coordination factor: Low. The most complex thing you’ll do is stand up on your pedals.\\n\\nWho digs it: Studio cycling is popular among people who want to be pushed very hard, especially those who thrive on group energy but hate choreogra- phy. Cyclists who are cooped up indoors during the winter also gravitate toward these classes.\\n\\nChapter 19: Choosing an Exercise Class or DVD\\n\\n293\\n\\nWhat to wear: Because most studio-cycling bikes have the same hard, narrow seats as outdoor racing bikes, a pair of padded bike shorts will help keep your fanny happy. Most bikes have water-bottle cages so you can stash your water within easy reach. Wear stiff-soled shoes; walking and running shoes are too soft, so your feet may get numb by the end of the class from being jammed into the toe clips. Some bikes have “clipless” pedals so that you can wear outdoor cycling shoes with cleats that click into the pedals.\\n\\nSigns of a sharp instructor: Good studio-cycling instructors don’t spend the whole class on the bike. They hop off and walk around, correcting form and offering encouragement.\\n\\nTips for first-timers: Ask your instructor to help you adjust the height of the handlebars, the height of the seat, and the distance of the seat from the han- dlebars. Setting up your bike correctly is important for avoiding injury and staying comfortable.\\n\\nWater aerobics/ballet/yoga and hydro-Spinning What it is: Water aerobics classes do traditional workouts in waist- to neck- high water. (Some of the more cutting-edge classes use equipment such as webbed gloves to make the workouts tougher.) The resistance of the water makes the workout feel far more intense, while the water cushions you from the impact.\\n\\nWhat it does for you: Water workouts gives you moderate fitness. Because water is 12 to 14 times thicker than air and offers resistance in every direc- tion, these classes can give you great muscle tone.\\n\\nThe exhaustion factor: Low. Most people won’t find water aerobics as hard as land-based aerobics. Although water is thicker and therefore harder to pull through than air, water really is a gentler medium. Still, we recommend an occasional water workout to get you off your feet and to give your muscles a balanced workout.\\n\\nThe coordination factor: Low. You’re forced to move so slowly that you have time to think about each move.\\n\\nWho digs it: Anyone who likes the water, has injuries, or is in physical rehab. Water workouts are a terrific cross-training activity for runners, cyclists, and maniac aerobicizers. Water workouts are also great for pregnant women, older people, and people with multiple sclerosis, osteoporosis, or other degenerative diseases because moving through the water is much easier on your body.\\n\\nWhat to wear: A swimsuit that doesn’t creep up your rear end. Wear a pair of old sneakers or special aqua-exercise shoes so you don’t scrape your feet on the bottom. Shoes will add more resistance to your workout.\\n\\n294 Part V: Conquering the Gym (Even at Home)\\n\\nSigns of a sharp instructor: Certification is a definite plus, but water- certification programs are few and far between. A good certification program is offered by the United States Water Fitness Association and by the Aqua Fitness organization.\\n\\nSafety should be the first priority in any class. A good instructor will iden- tify nonswimmers and insist that they wear life vests at all times during water aerobics. In water running, all class members — even experienced swimmers — wear flotation vests.\\n\\nTips for first-timers: Choosing the right class is essential. You don’t want to dive in with a group of 90-year-olds with limited mobility unless, of course, you are one. If you’re trying to come back from an injury, look for classes with names like Rehab for Runners. Check with the doctor treating your injury to make sure you have the okay to take a class. Also, realize that your target zone is about ten beats lower in the water than on land. (We define target zone in Chapter 8.)\\n\\nChoosing from Among All the Exercise DVDs\\n\\nIf you think that exercise DVDs are for wimps and disco groupies, you may be surprised to discover just how tough a workout you can get from popping a disc into a DVD player. (Well, not from the actual insertion of the disc, of course; you do have to follow it.) Yet for some reason, exercise DVDs still carry a stigma.\\n\\nLike health-club classes, fitness DVDs have become safer, more creative, and more specialized. You can buy DVDs for muscle toning, step aerobics, yoga, kickboxing, pregnancy, post-pregnancy, belly dancing, Ta’i Chi — the list goes on and on. Not only are there more high-quality tapes on the market, but because of the Internet, you can now read thousands of reviews, order DVDs more cheaply, and gain inspiration and helpful tips from Internet forums. This section tells you how to choose the winners and avoid the duds. We offer our best-instructor picks, shopping advice, and important tips for using exercise DVDs safely.\\n\\nAdvantages of exercise DVDs\\n\\nSure, exercise DVDs don’t suit everyone — you may feel silly prancing around your living room alone, mimicking an instructor who says, “You’re doing great!” even though he can’t see you. But if you’re short on time, self-conscious about your body, or taking care of kids at home, DVDs may suit you well. You\\n\\nChapter 19: Choosing an Exercise Class or DVD\\n\\n295\\n\\nwon’t feel pressure to keep up with anyone else, and you can build a pretty extensive DVD library for less than the cost of a yearly gym membership. Plus, you get a lot more instruction from a tape than you can get from a book or magazine. You may even get more creative routines than many health-club instructors can drum up.\\n\\nHow to choose a DVD\\n\\nChoosing the wrong DVD is hardly the most tragic mistake you can make in life. However, getting stuck with some out-of-focus program taught by an instructor who grates on your nerves isn’t any fun. The following tips can help you weed out tapes that aren’t right for you and DVDs that are just plain awful.\\n\\nRead reviews Amazon.com, the popular Internet bookseller, also sells DVDs and posts reader reviews. An even more informative source is Video Fitness (www.video fitness.com). This Web site is loaded with helpful information — probably because its mission is to inform and inspire you, not to sell products. (The site was recently purchased by FitnessOnline.com, which does sell magazines, books, and equipment, but the Video Fitness portion remains autonomous.) Hundred and hundreds of videos and DVDs are reviewed here — some by more than a dozen different exercisers. In addition to reviews of specific videos and DVDs, you can read general critiques of several instructors.\\n\\nScroll all the way through the reviews for each video or DVD, because opinions differ wildly. One reviewer says Denise Austin’s voice “has the same effect on me as fingernails on a chalkboard, made even worse by her patronizing tone; she makes me feel like a toddler she’s trying to potty-train.” Another reviewer adores Denise: “I appreciate her positive attitude. She makes you feel like you are right in the studio, or she is in your house with you.”\\n\\nIf you have no idea where to begin, try the Video Fitness “Personal Video Selector,” which guides you through the overwhelming choices by asking you a variety of questions and then recommending several videos and DVDs that appear to match your criteria. Also check out the 100 Club, a gallery of “VFers,” as Video Fitness enthusiasts call themselves, who own more than 100 videos or DVDs and list their favorites.\\n\\nCall a consultant You’ve heard of jury consultants, management consultants, and wardrobe consultants — well, there are also folks trained to help you sort through the bewildering slew of exercise DVDs on the market. These consultants are the staffers at Collage Exercise Video Specialists (www.collagevideo.com). It’s the country’s only catalog devoted to exercise tapes — and the only company\\n\\n296 Part V: Conquering the Gym (Even at Home)\\n\\nstaffed with operators who have actually sweated their way through many of the DVDs out there. The consultants have watched hundreds of DVDs, and they have TVs and DVD players at their desks so they can review the latest tapes between phone orders. On the Collage staff is a trainer certified by the American Council on Exercise.\\n\\nIn general, you tend to get a more thorough and honest appraisal from the consultants than from the catalog’s blurbs. The company rejects tapes that the staff considers unsafe or useless, but among those available for sale, you won’t find any bad reviews. After all, they’re in the business of selling DVDs. (The blurbs tend to use terms like “bubbly” and “enthusiastic” for instructors that we personally find shrill and annoying.) The consultants are trained to help you find DVDs that will suit your fitness level and personality, but if you prod them for their personal opinions, they’ll probably oblige. When we asked one of the consultants about a particular instructor, she said, “She seems so fake. I want to put plugs in my ears and go running the other way.”\\n\\nRent before you buy Large movie-rental stores like Blockbuster have a terrific, up-to-date selection of exercise DVDs (although they don’t carry many excellent-but-lesser-known instructors). Try out a bunch of instructors. Many have an entire line of DVDs, so if you find a teacher you like, chances are you’ll be happy with the whole lot. In the “Our favorite instructors” section later in this chapter, we list some of our preferred instructors.\\n\\nInspect the cover Before you even rent a DVD — and definitely before you buy — take a good look at the front and back of the jacket. You can’t always judge a DVD by its cover, but you can find plenty of clues. Pay attention to:\\n\\n(cid:2) The type of workout: Make sure that the workout is what you want, whether that’s abdominal toning, funk aerobics, or a stepping/body- sculpting combination. Look for a description of the actual moves — don’t go by the title or the hype. “Burns Fat,” “Pulsating Excitement!” and “A New Attitude” don’t tell you anything.\\n\\n(cid:2) The fitness level required: Look for a box that says “great for begin- ners.” Don’t start with a tape called “For Animals Only.” Some tapes offer modifications for all levels.\\n\\n(cid:2) The equipment required: Do you need a step? A tube? A weight bench? Three sets of dumbbells? Make sure that you either have what’s needed or are willing to buy it.\\n\\n(cid:2) The length of the whole DVD and the length of each segment: A\\n\\n60-minute step aerobics tape may have only 30 minutes of aerobics. The rest may be a warm-up, stretching session, and cooldown.\\n\\nChapter 19: Choosing an Exercise Class or DVD\\n\\n297\\n\\n(cid:2) Instructor credentials: If the teacher is certified by one of the legitimate professional organizations, you can bet that the cover will say so. Be wary if all you can find is “Internationally Recognized Fitness Expert.” See Chapter 4 for details about certification.\\n\\n(cid:2) The date of the copyright: Some tapes are timeless classics, but chances are, a DVD produced in the last couple of years will be more in tune with the latest training techniques. Also, choreography is a lot more creative than it used to be, and safety and instruction are given more considera- tion these days. Even some of the older workouts led by our favorite instructors contain moves considered unsafe by today’s standards.\\n\\nGet a sneak preview Before you try a DVD workout, sit down on your couch and watch it all the way through. Imagine yourself doing this tape week after week, and consider the following:\\n\\n(cid:2) Safety: Use your common sense. Is the instructor doing anything outra- geous, like arching her back so much that you can hear her vertebrae screaming for help?\\n\\n(cid:2) The instructor’s style and personality: Is the instructor upbeat and pro- fessional, or is she hyperventilating with excitement? Is she kind and encouraging, or does she refer to “the huge butt you may have?” Does she have a clear, resonant voice, or does she sound like she sucked helium? Some instructors sound like the cheerleader from hell, some do the sex-kitten thing, and others bark orders like a drill sergeant. One well-known instructor blurts out non sequiturs like “Lose those jigglies!” (cid:2) Instruction: Does the instructor use good form and give adequate direc- tions? Some instructors look great doing the workout but never explain proper technique or alert you about what to do next. Others go on and on about good form but don’t practice what they preach. In one workout, an instructor cautions against jumping around on hard surfaces while she leads an outdoor class on cement! Some instructors are so winded that they can’t even get the words out.\\n\\nDon’t give up on a tape just because the routine seems too complicated: The first time is bound to be confusing. But go with your instinct: Do you think you’ll ever get it, or is the instruction just plain lousy?\\n\\n(cid:2) Production quality: Does the sound warble? Is the DVD shot in focus? The tape doesn’t need to look like an Academy Award–winning feature, but neither should it appear to have been filmed with a camcorder in someone’s garage. At the same time, don’t confuse slick production with quality instruction.\\n\\n298 Part V: Conquering the Gym (Even at Home)\\n\\n(cid:2) The music: Much of the music you hear on exercise DVDs is bland, syn- thesized garbage. In fact, the music reminds us of a ’70s porn soundtrack. (Of course, we don’t watch porn, but if we did, we imagine that’s what a ’70s porn soundtrack would sound like.) Make sure you enjoy the music, or you may frequently opt out of your workout.\\n\\n(cid:2) The hype: Everyone progresses at a different pace. To motivate you,\\n\\ninstructors can and should say things like, “Most people will feel stronger and look better in about six weeks if they do this workout regularly.” They should not say, “You’ll lose 30 pounds in 6 weeks if you follow my routine and send away for my world-famous protein powder.”\\n\\nWhere to buy DVDs\\n\\nAt supermarkets or megachains like Wal-Mart, you can often pick up tapes for a fraction of the cost that you may pay in a retail store. (Videos and DVDs cost about $9.95 to $29.95.) But these stores don’t always have the best selec- tion. They tend to stick to name-brand instructors and celebrity DVDs, ignor- ing many first-rate but lesser-known teachers. And beware of return policies: You usually can’t get your money back unless the product is defective. You can’t just say, “I tried this tape, and it stinks.”\\n\\nFortunately, with the growth of the Internet, you have a lot more shopping options. Here are some of the best places to buy (or barter for) DVDs:\\n\\n(cid:2) Collage Video (www.collagevideo.com; 800-433-6769): This catalog\\n\\ncarries more than 700 videos and DVDs, probably the widest selection anywhere, including the latest offerings from top instructors who don’t have the clout to interest Blockbuster. Each blurb tells you how tough the workout is, how long each segment lasts, what type of music it’s set to, how major fitness magazines rate the tape, and what equipment you need.\\n\\nAlthough the prices aren’t always the lowest, the service is excellent, and the warehouse is well-stocked. The catalog’s official policy is to accept only defective returns; in reality, it’ll take back a tape that you simply don’t like — as long as you don’t abuse this policy.\\n\\n(cid:2) Amazon.com (www.amazon.com): The mega-giant online bookseller sells exercise DVDs as well as books (and just about everything else under the sun). Prices are low, service is good, and shipping is free if you order $25 or more. Plus, you can read reviews of each DVD before you buy. (cid:2) Fitness Wholesale (www.fwonline.com; 888-FW-ORDER or 330-929-7227): This Internet retailer offers volume discounts and even allows you to “rent” some DVDs; you pay full-price and get a new DVD, but it’ll refund part of the purchase price if you return the DVD within three weeks. (The amount of the refund is specified with each DVD.) The selection is rela- tively small, and you can only read descriptions of the DVDs, not reviews.\\n\\nChapter 19: Choosing an Exercise Class or DVD\\n\\n299\\n\\n(cid:2) Video Fitness (www.videofitness.com): This Web site doesn’t sell\\n\\nDVDs or videos, but you can trade with other videophiles through the site’s Video Exchange. You post your DVD “wish list” and a list of your own tapes that you don’t like or have outgrown and then negotiate trades with other VFers. No money changes hands.\\n\\nYour DVD options\\n\\nWhatever you want to improve, tighten, tone, build, or reduce, there’s an exercise DVD out there for you. Chances are, you’ll find dozens. Exercise DVDs usually fall into one of the following categories.\\n\\nAerobic This category includes high- and low-impact aerobics, step aerobics, strip aerobics, Spinning, funk, jump rope, and kickboxing tapes. The aim is to keep your heart rate elevated and your calorie burn high. Look for tips on proper form, how to use the equipment, and how to check your intensity level. These tapes should include an easy warm-up to get your blood flowing. The aerobic workout generally lasts 10 to 45 minutes. The cooldown should last at least three minutes and should be followed by a stretching session.\\n\\nStrength training Strength-training (also known as muscle toning or sculpting) DVDs use a variety of equipment, including dumbbells, bars, tubes, and bands. Some tapes focus on a particular body area, such as abdominals, thighs, or arms; others tone your whole body. You generally find two types of toning DVDs: gym-style and choreographed. Gym-style workouts typically work one muscle group at a time, doing 10 to 15 repetitions, and you usually need a weight bench.\\n\\nChoreographed toning routines may work several muscle groups at once or rotate. These routines aren’t dancy, but some of them do require coordination. They tend to give you more aerobic conditioning than gym-style workouts, but they won’t build as much strength.\\n\\nWatch these choreographed routines carefully: The instructor shouldn’t have you doing a massive number of repetitions. You shouldn’t do more than 15 reps per set — perhaps 30 for abdominals.\\n\\nToning tapes should explain how to choose the proper weight for each exer- cise. The warm-up should be well-rounded but have a bit more emphasis on the body parts you use in the main workout. The instructor should provide tips on proper form, how to make the exercise harder or easier, and how to modify a move if, say, you have a back or elbow injury. The cooldown and stretch segments should be similar to those in aerobic tapes.\\n\\n300 Part V: Conquering the Gym (Even at Home)\\n\\nCombination DVDs These circuit-training or boot-camp DVDs combine an aerobic workout with a full-fledged muscle-toning routine. The rules for both apply here, so review the two preceding sections.\\n\\nStretch, yoga, and Pilates The introduction should cover how to stretch, how to breathe, and what stretching, yoga, and/or Pilates can do for you. You typically start with simple exercises that prepare your muscles for more-challenging moves later in the workout. The main workout may not be much different from the warm-up, except that the moves are more advanced. Also, you may hold the positions longer. The instructor should tell where you should feel the stretch and offer constant technique reminders. Expect suggestions for people with back, knee, shoulder, and ankle injuries and for those who are less flexible. The cooldown may include meditation or relaxation exercises.\\n\\nSpecialty DVDs Specialty DVDs include ballet, country line dancing, pregnancy workouts, chair dancing, workouts for those with osteoporosis and arthritis, and rou- tines for those starting out after breast surgery. Some of these tapes are designed to teach you a new skill rather than take you through an actual workout. Use your judgment: If the workout doesn’t feel right, return the DVD to the rental store.\\n\\nOur favorite instructors\\n\\nThese aren’t the only good DVD instructors around, but they’re among the instructors who we think produce high-quality tapes on a consistent basis. Many of them have their own Web sites. Among our favorite sites are Cory Everson’s (www.coryeverson.com) and Cathe Friedrich’s (www.cathe.com).\\n\\nBeginning Check out these instructors’ tapes if you’re a beginner:\\n\\n(cid:2) Gilad Janklowicz (cid:2) Cynthia Kereluk (cid:2) Leslie Sansone (cid:2) Richard Simmons\\n\\nChapter 19: Choosing an Exercise Class or DVD\\n\\n301\\n\\nBeginning/intermediate Try a beginning/intermediate-level workout tape from one of these instructors:\\n\\n(cid:2) Kari Anderson (cid:2) Jennifer Kries (The Method) (cid:2) Gin Miller (cid:2) Donna Richardson (cid:2) Kathy Smith\\n\\nIntermediate/advanced If you’re looking for an intermediate or more advanced program, work out with one of these instructors:\\n\\n(cid:2) Candice Copeland (cid:2) Cathe Friedrich (cid:2) Gay Gasper (cid:2) Lisa Gaylord (cid:2) Kathy Kaehler (cid:2) Karen Voight\\n\\nImportant safety tips\\n\\nSafety is an important consideration, especially when you don’t have much exercise experience and you’re working out in an unsupervised setting. Follow these safety tips:\\n\\n(cid:2) Make sure that you clear adequate space in front of the TV so you\\n\\ndon’t bang your shins on the coffee table or knock over any lamps. (cid:2) For aerobics and strength-training tapes, wear proper aerobics shoes rather than bare feet or socks. You also may want to buy a board made of springy wood similar to what you find in good aerobics studios. These boards help absorb impact. Gerstung makes a 30-x-60-inch board for about $160 and a 30-x-30-inch board for about $80. In any case, don’t jump around on concrete floors.\\n\\n302 Part V: Conquering the Gym (Even at Home)\\n\\n(cid:2) Even if the instructor doesn’t do it on the DVD, gauge your intensity by checking your heart rate or taking the talk test during or immedi- ately following an intense portion of the workout. We explain these methods in Chapter 6. All our favorite instructors do intensity checks in their workouts.\\n\\n(cid:2) Don’t try to keep up with the instructors. They practiced the routine for weeks before it was filmed. Look for someone in the DVD who goes at your pace. Good tapes have demonstrators who exercise at different levels. At the start of the workout, the lead instructor should say some- thing like, “If you’re a beginner, keep your eye on Valerie.” If you get winded, keep moving by marching in place or walking in a circle.\\n\\n(cid:2) If you’re just starting out, consider buying a DVD that includes three\\n\\nshort workouts rather than one long one. The shorter workouts last 15 to 25 minutes as opposed to 30 to 90 minutes.\\n\\n(cid:2) Remember that your DVD player has a pause button. Use it if you need\\n\\nto get water.\\n\\nChapter 20 Designing a Home Gym\\n\\nIn This Chapter (cid:1) Planning for a quality gym (cid:1) Shopping like a pro (cid:1) Checking out cardio equipment (cid:1) Getting the best strengthening equipment (cid:1) Looking at gadgets to improve your flexibility\\n\\nThe home-exercise industry is booming. Americans spend more than $4\\n\\nbillion on equipment every year, and it’s easy to understand why. You can’t beat the commute to your living room, and you can work out at 3 a.m. on Sunday if you really want to. You don’t have to pay membership fees, wait in line for the shower, or deal with any unidentified biological matter that doesn’t contain your own DNA.\\n\\nYet, despite all the convenience, home exercisers have a high dropout rate. The novelty wears off, the bike breaks down, or the 5-pound dumbbell gets used as a doorstop. You can avoid this scenario and the accompanying guilt by designing your home gym carefully. This chapter shows you how.\\n\\nPlanning Your Exercise Space\\n\\nThe inspiration to exercise may have come to you suddenly, but don’t make any rash decisions when you buy equipment. You can save yourself time, aggravation, and money by putting some thought into your purchases. Before you even set foot in a fitness store, size up your goals, your budget, and your available space. Here are some specifics to consider before you go shopping.\\n\\nLooking at the big picture\\n\\nIf you want to get fit at home, be sure to cover all the bases: aerobic fitness, strength, and flexibility. But your home doesn’t have to be a palace with high\\n\\n304 Part VI: Conquering the Gym (Even at Home)\\n\\nceilings, racks of shiny weights, and space-age machinery. A complete home gym can consist of a rubber tube, a step, and a handful of videos — equipment that a student on a budget could fit into a studio apartment.\\n\\nBefore you go shopping, think about your goals and consider what type of equipment you’re going to need to succeed in all three areas of fitness. Don’t just say, “I’ll start with an elliptical trainer, and maybe eventually I’ll buy some weights.” If you plan to get your aerobic exercise outdoors — walking, jogging, or skating, for example — then, sure, spend all of your home-gym budget on weight equipment. Just make sure you have an aerobic exercise plan for the winter. Buying flexibility gadgets needn’t be a priority, although in the “Considering Flexibility Gadgets” section later in this chapter, we do recommend buying a cushy mat.\\n\\nChoosing an inviting spot for your equipment\\n\\nWhere you park your exercise bike can make all the difference between using it to get fit and simply using it as an extra chair for your Academy Awards parties. Put your equipment near entertaining distractions such as the TV or stereo (or away from them, if you want to be away from other family mem- bers). And make sure that the spot has adequate ventilation, space, lighting, and climate control; there’s a reason that only spiders hang out in cold, damp basement corners.\\n\\nIf you’re lucky enough to have a spare room, consider reserving it exclusively for your gym. If you don’t have an extra room, at least try to keep all your gadgets near one another. Don’t store your dumbbells in the bedroom, your treadmill in the basement, and your stretching mat in the coat closet. Also, plan to keep your equipment within reach. You don’t want to hunt through ten drawers to find your favorite exercise DVD. And chances are, anything you store under your bed will stay there — permanently.\\n\\nWe also recommend installing a mirror, preferably in the area where you plan to lift weights. A mirror gives your home gym that health-club feel and enables you to keep an eye on your form. Plus, you can flex your muscles, and no one will think you’re a jerk. Over time, you can watch your body slim down and firm up.\\n\\nTaking careful measurements\\n\\nBefore you buy a major piece of equipment, including a mirror, carefully mea- sure the length, width, and height of your available space. You don’t want your dumbbells smashing that new mirror when you raise your arms out to\\n\\nChapter 20: Designing a Home Gym\\n\\n305\\n\\nthe side. You don’t want to bump your head against the ceiling when you press the incline button on your new treadmill. Keep in mind that many equipment stores have high ceilings to accommodate tall equipment.\\n\\nMeasure your door to make sure that you can get your new machinery into the house. Liz ruined a brand-new stationary bicycle when she pounded on the handles with a rubber mallet in an attempt to squeeze the bike through a doorway that was too narrow. One of the handles broke off, which served her right.\\n\\nThinking about flooring\\n\\nIf you use exercise DVDs, place your DVD player in a room with a rug rather than a tile or cement floor. The extra padding provided by carpeting helps protect your joints. Plus, there’s less danger of slipping.\\n\\nDon’t pump iron on a tile floor, either. If you drop a weight, you’ll crack the tile. Carpeting is okay. If you have the luxury of an extra room just for your home gym (and lots of money to spare), consider a rubberized floor. They can run as high as $3,000. Whatever type of floor you have, we recommend putting rubberized mats ($50 to $100) underneath your cardiovascular equip- ment. This reduces vibration and keeps your floor from getting stained by the globs of oil and other junk that inevitably drip from the underside of a tread- mill or other equipment.\\n\\nEquipment Shopping Tips\\n\\nAfter you measure your space, you’re ready to hit the stores. The following tips apply to home equipment in general. Check out the “Investing in Cardio Equipment” and “Buying Strength Equipment” sections for suggestions that are specific to aerobic equipment and strength machines.\\n\\nShopping around\\n\\nPrices vary widely, so by all means, bargain-hunt. But remember: A machine isn’t a bargain if it collapses with you on it or gives you a hernia. For fancy equipment with lots of moving parts — treadmills, elliptical trainers, stair- climbers, rowers, weight machines, and the like — stick with stores that spe- cialize in fitness equipment. They tend to sell sturdier, more-reliable, and better-designed machines. For simpler equipment like dumbbells, ankle weights, steps, and jump ropes, department stores and sporting goods stores are fine.\\n\\n306 Part VI: Conquering the Gym (Even at Home)\\n\\nIf you know the exact make and model you want, you may save money by calling the manufacturer directly. Some manufacturers let you buy direct; others may refer you to a local dealer. But do your homework: Sometimes you can get a better deal from the manufacturer. Other times, going through the dealer is cheaper. You can often save a couple hundred bucks by making a few phone calls.\\n\\nBuying used equipment is okay, but keep it simple. Stick to gadgets with no motors or complicated designs. The only exception is buying used equipment through an authorized dealer that gives you a warranty. No matter what type of used equipment you buy, ask for a trial period and get all the instruction manuals.\\n\\nA knowledgeable trainer can save you a lot of research time and may be able to help you purchase equipment. Trainers often get discounts from equip- ment dealers because they recommend and buy equipment on a regular basis. But ask your trainer if he receives a commission from the dealer or if he’ll be charging you a commission; this may eat away at any potential sav- ings. In other cases, a dealer may give you a discount on top of the trainer’s commission.\\n\\nAs we explain in the “The Ten Commandments of buying TV fitness gadgets” sidebar, we generally don’t recommend buying exercise equipment off TV or the Internet. The picture and real-time video may look fabulous, but when the gizmo arrives at your doorstep, it may be a useless plastic piece of junk. Or it may not even arrive at all, as a friend of Liz’s discovered when she ordered a sports watch that never showed up. When the woman tried to check out the Web site again, the URL no longer worked — a tactic that some companies use to evade government regulators.\\n\\nBuy from the Internet only after you research the product, know exactly which make and model you want, and know that the online dealer is reputable. Liz buys all her athletic shoes on the Internet from a well-known mail-order catalog and saves over 40 percent. Occasionally, she also buys a small piece of exercise equipment over the Internet. For example, she recently found a brand-name heart-rate monitor online for $20 less than the list price.\\n\\nTaking a test drive\\n\\nYou wouldn’t buy a car without taking it for a spin. The same rule applies to exercise machines. Be sure to test every feature. Pull every handle and push every bar. Make sure that a stationary bike pedals smoothly at several tension levels. Try a treadmill on the flat setting and on the incline setting. If the salesperson won’t let you give the machine a whirl, say adios.\\n\\nChapter 20: Designing a Home Gym\\n\\n307\\n\\nLooking for safety features\\n\\nConsider buying equipment with safety features, especially if you have chil- dren. For example, to start some treadmills you must punch in a code or wear a special magnet on a string that you wrap around your waist. If you happen to fall, the magnet breaks the connection with the treadmill, and the machine automatically shuts off.\\n\\nAsking for a discount\\n\\nHigh-tech cardio machines and strength machines tend to be marked up about 40 percent above wholesale, so your salesperson probably has some leeway. Asking for a 10 percent discount is perfectly appropriate. You may not get it, but it never hurts to ask. Also, if you’re buying several items, ask the salesperson to throw in a complimentary accessory, such as a rubber floor mat to place underneath your equipment. Depending on the square footage, a mat can cost $50 to $200. Some stores will cut your mat to size.\\n\\nChecking out warranty and service plans\\n\\nIf you’re choosing between two similar machines, take the one with the better warranty, even if it costs a bit more. Both aerobic and weight machines should have at least a minimum one-year warranty on all parts.\\n\\nFind out who’s responsible for repairs and maintenance: A good warranty is worthless if no one within 3,000 miles can fix the darn thing. If you buy a machine from an equipment specialty store, chances are someone from the store will come to your house and fix it. Some equipment manufacturers have repairmen on call throughout the country. If you buy from a discount sporting goods store or a TV offer, you may be out of luck.\\n\\nInvesting in Cardio Equipment\\n\\nHome cardiovascular machines have gotten pretty fancy, and the array of choices can be mind-blowing. Should you go with the elliptical trainer? The rower? The elliptical-rower? The elliptical-rower-stair-climber-treadmill– automatic slicer–microwave oven?\\n\\nActually, although the choices are many, we’re pleased to report that your chances of buying a high-quality machine are better than ever. Since the first edition of this book was published, the frenzy to market gimmicky cardio\\n\\n308 Part VI: Conquering the Gym (Even at Home)\\n\\nmachines — riders, gliders, and such — has come to a near halt. (Infomercial producers seem to have switched from hawking schlocky cardio contraptions to hawking bogus weight-loss supplements, which we describe in Chapter 26.)\\n\\nWhich type of home cardio machine is the best? Our answer hasn’t changed from the first two editions: The best machine is the one you’ll use. That’s why testing several machines before you bring one home is so important. You don’t want to end up with a space-eating, dust-collecting monster that you can’t wait to unload in your next garage sale. This chapter helps you sort through the different options. After you buy your equipment, read Chapter 9, which describes how to use good form on each type of cardio machine.\\n\\nTreadmills\\n\\nTreadmill prices have dropped considerably in the past few years, while the quality of some lower-priced models has improved. You can now buy a decent treadmill for under $1,000.\\n\\nWe think self-powered treadmills, the ones without motors, are a waste of money. You typically can’t get the walking belt moving unless you incline the machine, but that makes the exercise too challenging for many beginners. Running on these treadmills is impossible — you need an even steeper incline, and the belt tends to stick.\\n\\nNor are we fond of treadmills with arm attachments — ski-pole-type mecha- nisms that you push and pull as you walk or run on the treadmill. Most tread- mills with arms are lousy; the rowing motion doesn’t match your natural arm swing, so your whole stride is thrown off. (On the other hand, many of the bikes, ladder climbers, and elliptical trainers with arm handles work well.) The big selling point with these double-duty treadmills is the extra calorie burn, but you’re not going to burn more calories if the machine slows you down, feels awkward, or exhausts you so quickly that you head for the couch after ten minutes. And if you swing your arms the way you naturally would when walking or running, you’re getting that extra calorie benefit, anyway.\\n\\nImportant treadmill features Treadmills used to be large, noisy, cumbersome contraptions. Now most of them are smooth, streamlined, and quiet. Still, you need to thoroughly inspect any treadmill before you buy it. Here’s what to look for:\\n\\nChapter 20: Designing a Home Gym\\n\\n309\\n\\n(cid:2) A motor to move the walking belt: Make sure that the belt moves fluidly. (cid:2) Safety features: Don’t look twice at any model that doesn’t have an emer- gency stop button and an automatic slow-start speed. A front hand rail is helpful for maintaining balance and is probably safer than side rails, which may actually disrupt your balance if they impede your arm swing. Consider a machine that requires a security code or special magnet to make it go, especially if you have young children. We like the magnet fea- ture for adults, too: If you lose your balance, a magnet that’s connected to the treadmill’s console pulls off the display panel, causing the machine to automatically shut off.\\n\\n(cid:2) Feedback: Your machine should display the time, distance, speed, and\\n\\ncalories burned. Many treadmills also come with a set of preprogrammed workouts and a heart-monitor hookup. (If the heart-rate monitor isn’t built into the handrails, you can wear a chest monitor, and your heart rate will appear on the display screen.) Treadmill displays have drasti- cally improved in recent years; you may be able to find one that displays motivating graphics of people exercising at your same pace.\\n\\nBOSU balance trainers\\n\\nBOSU balance trainers are a hot new way to get a cardio workout while also improving your flex- ibility. These fun products are shaped like a dome (see the following figure) that works like a step, but because the trainers are an unstable surface, you challenge your core muscles in addition to getting a great cardio workout. A BOSU will set you back about only $100; $150 with videos and shipping (see www.bosu.com), and they don’t take up much space in your home gym.\\n\\nincluded\\n\\n310 Part VI: Conquering the Gym (Even at Home)\\n\\n(cid:2) An incline capability: Walking uphill adds intensity and variety to your\\n\\nworkouts. With most machines, you either turn a crank or press a button to simulate hills. Beware of treadmills that create an incline with hydraulic pistons. These models, often found in department stores, are not likely to support your weight through continued use and tend to break easily and often. If you look at the front of the treadmill on either side and see a metal bar that resembles a bicycle pump (that’s the hydraulic piston you’re looking at), pass on the machine.\\n\\n(cid:2) Programs: Automatic programs cost an additional $200 to $2,000, but if this feature motivates you, it’s probably worth the money. Still, you can create your own varied workouts using the training techniques we describe in Chapter 8.\\n\\nOur favorite treadmills Trotter, Star Trac, BodyGuard, Landice, Precor, and True make solid tread- mills with good warranties and service. Precor sells a treadmill for less than $1,000 in certain price-club stores (locations with a dealer service network). The machine has a one-year warranty with guaranteed service. We were pleasantly surprised by its lower-price model, although we don’t recommend it for anyone who runs at high speeds more than an hour a day.\\n\\nElliptical trainers\\n\\nPart stair-climber, part treadmill, part stationary cycle, elliptical trainers are the hottest trend in cardio machines. Your legs travel in an elongated circular movement, and, on some models, you pump poles back and forth for an upper-body workout. On the best models, you feel like you’re doing a sort of rhythmic glide; on the worst, you feel like you’re stumbling downhill on your tiptoes.\\n\\nUnfortunately, most home elliptical trainers we’ve tried are like most Elvis impersonators: From afar, they resemble the real thing, but on closer inspec- tion, they’re nothing but a cheesy imitation. Most of the home units, especially those under $500, aren’t as smooth or as comfortable as the more expensive gym-quality models. The home units tend to have a stride length that’s too short, too deep, too choppy, or a combination of all three problems. And most of them are so flimsy that we were able to loosen the bolts from the frame and rock them from side to side while taking a test run. This doesn’t bode well for durability. Most home elliptical trainers with arm poles are useless because they offer no resistance at all.\\n\\nThe home models we like fall into the major splurge category. The best is by Precor, the company that launched this category. But this machine will set you back nearly $3,500. The Life Fitness home elliptical trainer, for $3,000,\\n\\nChapter 20: Designing a Home Gym\\n\\n311\\n\\ncomes in a distant but acceptable second. On the cheaper end, Vision Fitness has a $1,500 model that isn’t nearly as sturdy as the one from Precor, but it will withstand limited use. Under $500 is an elliptical trainer from ProForm, and although it won’t stand up the way more expensive ones will, more and more reliable models are coming available in this price range.\\n\\nStair-climbers\\n\\nWe’re talking about two foot plates you pump up and down to mimic the action of climbing stairs. Stair-climbers, also called steppers, usually have front or side rails that you hold onto for balance. Their consoles display time, distance, steps per minute (spm), number of flights climbed, and calories burned.\\n\\nMost steppers have an independent action; that is, the movement of one pedal is not affected by the other. With dependent models, the act of straightening one leg to lower the step causes the other pedal to rise. This isn’t just a tech- nical detail: Usually, you like the feel of one and hate the other.\\n\\nAlmost all steppers in the $200 to $1,200 range use hydraulic pistons or air pressure to power the pedals. These cheaper steppers are nowhere near as smooth moving as the stair machines people line up for at the gym. Some people don’t mind the way they feel, but do stay away from the $200 models, and look for one that doesn’t wobble from side to side as you climb. Precor and Schwinn make decent ones at the low end of the price scale.\\n\\nIf you want a gym-quality climber, go with the industry leader: StairMaster (www.stairmaster.com). StairMaster makes independent-action machines that use chains and cables to move the steps — and carry price tags of over $3,000. Tectrix makes a respectable clone for about half that amount. LifeStep manufactures the most popular dependent-action home climber in the same price range.\\n\\nStationary bikes\\n\\nBiking is a no-brainer: Park your butt on the seat, plant your feet on the pedals, and away you go, so to speak. You can spend up to $3,000 on a fully- loaded, high-tech super cycle — or $400 for a sturdy, no-frills workhorse. Just keep in mind that every cool feature you opt for jacks up the price.\\n\\nBefore you buy, test-drive both upright and recumbent bikes. Recumbent bikes provide back support so that you pedal straight out in front of you. If you have lower-back discomfort, you may appreciate the back support. Recumbents also target your butt and rear thigh muscles at a different angle than upright bikes (the traditional kind, which resemble regular bicycles).\\n\\n312 Part VI: Conquering the Gym (Even at Home)\\n\\nWhichever style you prefer, don’t buy a bike from a department store, because quality isn’t normally a big consideration in the designs of these products. Some cheap bike seats have been known to collapse with a rider in mid-workout. You don’t want to know where the seat pole winds up. Besides, specialty stores carry plenty of inexpensive models.\\n\\nImportant bike features Two stationary bikes that look similar may feel very different to your derriere and offer different electronic options. So test-ride every bike and do a thorough check of the features:\\n\\n(cid:2) A comfortable, sturdy seat: Fancy features don’t help if you can’t sit on the thing for more than five minutes. Some people like a seat that’s hard and narrow; others prefer one that’s wider and softer. Don’t assume that a wide, cushy seat is going to be more comfortable. Extra padding under your rear end is nice to have when you watch TV, but when you exercise, the extra surface area can cause chafing and discomfort. Whatever seat you prefer, it should lock securely into place.\\n\\n(cid:2) Seat and handlebar adjustments: Make sure that when you sit on the seat, your leg is almost straight at the bottom of the pedal stroke. The handlebars and width of the pedal straps should be adjustable, too. For more details about stationary-bike adjustments, see Chapter 9.\\n\\n(cid:2) Feedback: You can pay extra for fun features such as preset workout\\n\\nprograms, a heart-rate monitor, and games that let you race against the computer. But at the very least, your bike should have a speedometer that displays revolutions per minute (rpm) and miles per hour (mph), an odometer to measure distance, and a timer to keep track of those minutes as they fly by.\\n\\nOne exception to this rule: Spinning-type bikes. These bikes, primarily used in group exercise classes, are also available for home purchase. They don’t have feedback mechanisms, but they have other advantages worth a look. For example, their seat and handlebar positions make the machines feel more like outdoor bicycles. They’re relatively inexpensive compared to most other high-quality stationary bikes, and you can buy workout videos specially designed to be used with these bikes. (See a list of some of our favorite bike brands in the next section.) One common complaint is that the seats are uncomfortable, but that’s because they’re equipped with racing saddles, which are thin and hard. Wearing padded shorts should solve the problem.\\n\\n(cid:2) A way to vary the difficulty: Look for a knob or button that indicates resistance levels, such as 1 through 12. This way you can accurately measure every workout and track your progress. If 10 minutes on Level 1 used to wear you out, but now you can breeze through 20 minutes on Level 3, you know you’ve come a long way.\\n\\nChapter 20: Designing a Home Gym\\n\\n313\\n\\nOur favorite bike brands Here’s a brief list of our favorites, but be sure to test-ride any model you’re considering to make sure it’s comfortable for you:\\n\\n(cid:2) Non-computerized uprights ($200–$500): Monark, Bodyguard, Schwinn,\\n\\nand Tunturi\\n\\n(cid:2) Spinning-type uprights: Schwinn ($700–$1,200), Keiser ($500–$900), and\\n\\nReebok ($600–$1,000)\\n\\n(cid:2) Computerized uprights ($500–$3,000): Lifecycle, Tectrix, Precor, Combi,\\n\\nand Cateye\\n\\n(cid:2) Computerized recumbents ($500–$2,000): Precor, Life Fitness, Body\\n\\nGuard, and Lifecycle\\n\\nRowing machines\\n\\nForget the rowers with two arms that you pull toward you as you slide the seat backwards. You can never get the tension in the arms quite even, and the entire rowing movement feels sticky and unnatural. If you already have one of these, we’re betting it’s the most expensive coat hanger you own.\\n\\nA newer breed of rowers has a chain or cable that wraps around a flywheel. The chain is attached to a handle you pull in a smooth movement toward your chest as you straighten your legs and slide the seat backward. These new rowers do a much better job of capturing the feel of rowing on the water.\\n\\nConcept II (www.concept2.com) makes an excellent rower that is available through dealers around the country. This machine is so good that the U.S. Olympic Rowing Team trains on it during the off-season. And under $1,000, it gets a Best Buy rating from us. Water Rower makes a good machine that costs a few hundred dollars more. The flywheel churns through a tub of water and makes a sound that’s relaxing.\\n\\nTwo cardiovascular bargains\\n\\nYes, you can improve your stamina with equipment that costs less than $100. Here are two dirt-cheap yet very effective aerobic conditioning gadgets.\\n\\nA step Though essentially nothing more than a glorified milk crate, a step can whip you into shape. Most steps are rectangular, hard plastic platforms; some are springy wood. Good ones have some sort of rubber covering on the top to\\n\\n314 Part VI: Conquering the Gym (Even at Home)\\n\\nprevent your feet from slipping. Look for Lego-type inserts called risers that snap on underneath to increase the height of the step. Reebok and The Step Company make sturdy steps. In Chapter 19, we recommend several step video instructors to help you make good use of your purchase.\\n\\nA jump rope Jump ropes may remind you of pony-tailed little girls in school yards, but don’t be fooled: Skipping rope offers some very real, very adult fitness bene- fits. It strengthens your cardiovascular system, improves your agility, burns tons of calories, and tones your thighs, calves, abdominals, back, chest, and shoulders. You can take your rope with you anywhere, and to use it, you don’t need any more space than a small coffee table takes up.\\n\\nJump ropes have been subjected to a bit of technology in the past few years. Forget about the frayed cloth ropes you used as a kid. Even leather is history. Many ropes are now made of tough, molded plastic; metal wire coated in acrylic; or space-age polymers with names we can’t pronounce, let alone spell. These materials make for ropes that turn faster and more smoothly. Look for features like soft foam or rubber handles, which prevent callusing, and ball-bearing-like swivel action between the cord and handles.\\n\\nYou can get a perfectly good jump rope at a sporting goods store or depart- ment store for as little as $3, although you may want to spend $15 to $30 for the fancy features. To size your rope correctly, stand on the center of the cord and pull the ends straight up along your sides. The handles should just reach your armpits.\\n\\nMany people avoid jumping rope because they view it as a high-impact activity. But if you do it right, it’s more like a medium-impact activity on the order of a brisk walk. The secret is staying low. Your feet should barely clear the floor, and you should bend your knees just slightly.\\n\\nUse a light rope if your aim is to work on skill and agility and to jump fast. Fat, weighted ropes (1⁄4 to 1⁄2 pound) work well for building upper-body muscular endurance, but using them for fancy footwork or special tricks is a bit like asking a Clydesdale to run the Kentucky Derby. Buy one of each, and you can mix up your workouts. With weighted ropes, the weight should be in the cord, not the handles.\\n\\nWhen you jump, keep your arms relaxed and slightly bent, and keep your upper-body movements to a minimum. Instead of turning your arms in big circles, simply let your wrists swivel slightly. (This is especially important when using a heavy rope; otherwise, you’re in for sore shoulders.) Start with a few short sets — about 30 jumps for a light rope, 5 to 10 turns for a heavy rope. Rest by marching in place between sets. Gradually increase the number\\n\\nChapter 20: Designing a Home Gym\\n\\n315\\n\\nof sets and jumps per set while decreasing the time you spend marching. Eventually, you’ll be able to jump 10 minutes or more continuously (probably less with a heavy rope). Humming the theme song from Rocky helps. Building up to long periods of jumping rope is tough, because it’s a very intense activ- ity. Jumping rope is best used as a cross-training workout or between body- part exercises while circuit training (see Chapter 15).\\n\\nThe Ten Commandments of buying TV fitness gadgets\\n\\nIn 1984, when the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) abolished limits on the amount of com- mercial time a television station could air, the commission unleashed a monster: the infomer- cial. When it comes to fitness products, there’s not a whole lot of info in these half-hour com- mercials that often masquerade as talk shows. Typically, they’re filled with exaggerated claims, shameless testimonials, outlandish stunts, and lots of scientific malarkey — all intended to sep- arate you from your dollar.\\n\\nTry to avoid buying fitness products from TV or a Web site. You have no way to judge the qual- ity of a machine, pill, or gadget. If you do end up purchasing a product that you believe was falsely advertised, file a complaint with the FTC by contacting the organization’s Consumer Response Center (877-FTC-HELP or www. ftc.org).\\n\\nHere are some tips to keep in mind as you watch or read fitness product advertising: (cid:2) Don’t be suckered by the infomercial audi- ence or “real people” offering testimonials. Those wholesome folks who whip them- selves into a near-evangelical frenzy at the mere mention of the product at hand are usually paid. Often, they’ve never even tried the product they’re gushing over. One acquaintance of Liz gave an emotional tes- timonial for an exercise video, even though\\n\\nshe had never even watched it. “I just wanted to be on TV,” she said.\\n\\n(cid:2) Beware of the phrase “guaranteed or your money back.” Read the fine print: The man- ufacturers may promise that you’ll lose 4 inches in one month — if you stick to a low- fat diet and a far more extensive exercise program.\\n\\n(cid:2) Don’t whip out your credit card just because a product isn’t sold in stores. Truth is, most of these gizmos are sold in stores — or they will be on the shelves in a month or two. Sometimes the product is actually cheaper at the store; plus, you can test the product before you buy.\\n\\n(cid:2) Don’t be impressed by references to Europe, ancient China, or 3,000-year-old secrets. Bogus fitness products use European research much the same way that “reality” TV shows use Peruvian reli- gious miracles as examples of amazing phenomena: They’re too far away for the average person to check out carefully. (cid:2) Beware of phrases like “three easy pay- ments” and watch shipping costs. One gadget claims to cost “Not $60! Not $50!” but “just two easy payments of $19.95.” Add in exorbitant (and nonrefundable) shipping and handling costs, and it costs $66.85.\\n\\n(continued)\\n\\n316 Part VI: Conquering the Gym (Even at Home)\\n\\n(continued)\\n\\n(cid:2) Don’t be swayed by scientific terminology. Product manufacturers love to throw around big words, but some of the most terms have no impressive-sounding accepted meaning in the scientific commu- nity. Others are misused to hype bogus products.\\n\\n(cid:2) Give no credence to celebrity or “expert” endorsements. Don’t think for a minute that a three-time Mr. Universe built his biceps with some plastic contraption that looks like a model of the Starship Enterprise. Athletes and celebs know that fame can be short- lived, and at some point their name may be their only asset. “There’s a lot you can talk yourself into,” one athlete told us. “You figure, I’ve gotta make a living. If the public’s dumb enough to buy this stuff, that’s their problem.” Beware, too, of health and fitness “experts” with fancy titles they may have invented.\\n\\n(cid:2) Don’t be awed by the fact that a product was “awarded a U.S. patent.” You could\\n\\npatent a nose-hair clipper for mice if you wanted to. To get a patent, you need to have an original idea or process, not necessarily a good one.\\n\\n(cid:2) Beware of the term “proven.” Many com- panies cite scientific research without telling you where the studies were con- ducted. When we inquired about a certain cardio machine, we learned that the calo- rie-burning studies — which seemed dubi- ous to us — were carried out by a company that the manufacturer owned. This is like admitting your mother was the judge of a beauty contest you won; maybe you were the best looking, but we need to hear it from an unbiased party.\\n\\n(cid:2) Hide your credit card between midnight and 4 a.m. At that hour, everything kinda looks good. Go to bed. If you’re tempted to buy an infomercial product, jot down the number and wait before ordering. You may feel differently about that Ginzu Rider in the light of day.\\n\\nBuying Strength Equipment\\n\\nThere’s no shortage of great gadgets to build your muscles at home. There’s also, regrettably, no shortage of junk. This chapter covers all your legitimate strength-training options — from $3 rubber tubes to sophisticated, gym-qual- ity machinery. We introduce you to some innovative new products and help you decide which type of equipment is best for your home and your budget.\\n\\nIf you’re going to lift weights at home, read Chapters 11 through 14. In those chapters, we explain how to use all types of strength equipment and how to design a strength-training program that’ll get you results.\\n\\nExercise bands and tubes\\n\\nRubber bands and tubes are the absolute cheapest way to strengthen your muscles — you can buy three or four bands for $15 or $20. They’re also extremely versatile and great for traveling. Even if you own weight machines\\n\\nChapter 20: Designing a Home Gym\\n\\n317\\n\\nor an extensive set of free weights, we recommend throwing in a few bands for variety. (Just know that bands and tubes have their limitations, which we explain in Chapter 13.)\\n\\nBands are flat latex strips about 6 inches wide and about 3 feet long, some with handles attached; you hold onto each end or tie the ends around some- thing sturdy, like the leg of your sofa. Tubes come in a variety of sizes and are shaped like very flexible garden hoses, usually with plastic or rubber handles attached. You’ll probably like bands for some exercises and tubes for others; you just have to experiment. Because bands and tubes are so inexpensive, it pays to get a variety.\\n\\nFor a few dollars more, you can buy bands or tubes with plastic or rubber handles — a real plus for getting a firm grip on an exercise. Some bands or tubes have built-in ankle and thigh straps. Theraband and LifeLine make nifty band kits that come with a travel bag and several door and bar attachments, priced from $30 to $60. Spri and DynaBand also make quality bands. Because some bands don’t come with instructions, we recommend buying a couple of DVDs with band workouts. The following instructors offer quality band work- outs: Lynn Brick, Jodi Cohen, David Essel, Donna Richardson, Keli Roberts, and Tamilee Webb.\\n\\nYou also can buy band loops with little foam circles of padding, but you don’t really need them. You can just tie your regular band in a circle, which is even more versatile because you can control the diameter of the circle. The smaller the circle, the tighter the tension. You can use a circle to do a number of leg exercises and a few upper-body exercises, too.\\n\\nTwo cautions regarding the use of bands: Check frequently for holes and tears by holding your bands up to the light. When a band is damaged, replace it immediately. And never try to use regular office rubber bands — even thick ones — for exercising. You’re just asking to be snapped in the face.\\n\\nAnkle weights\\n\\nAnkle weights are great for making floor exercises (like leg lifts) tougher. You’ll probably want ankle weights if you like body-sculpting exercise DVDs because at some point, lifting your own body weight will become too easy. As with dumbbells, you can buy an array of ankle weights, from 2 pounds up to 20 pounds. Or you can buy an adjustable set: You insert small weight bars into pockets along the strap. Adjustable ankle weights are a great way to save money. Just know that the weights tend to rattle around. And, it’s easy to get lazy; don’t neglect to add or subtract weight when you need to. Use ankle weights sparingly if you have hip, knee, or ankle problems. Or, try a pair of weights that strap around your thighs. You may find them awkward to use at first because, well, they’re strapped to your thighs, but you get used to them quickly, and they do a good job of distributing extra weight without overload- ing your knees.\\n\\n318 Part VI: Conquering the Gym (Even at Home)\\n\\nFree weights\\n\\nFree weights — dumbbells and barbells — are excellent investments: They’re simple, versatile, and relatively inexpensive. They do, however, have the highest accident potential; just ask anyone who has dropped a weight on his foot or gotten pinned under a heavy bar. If you’re new to free-weight training, please take a few sessions with a trainer. And never do any heavy lifting when you’re alone.\\n\\nOn the upside, you won’t compromise safety by buying the cheap weights sold at department and sporting goods stores. Weight is weight. There’s not much difference between one brand and another. Like meat, free weights are usually sold by the pound. You can pay up to $2 a pound for shiny chrome dumbbells and bars. Gray or black steel will run you 45¢ to $1.50 per pound.\\n\\nDumbbells For a beginner, dumbbells (the short weights that you can lift with one hand) should be a higher priority than barbells (the long ones that require both hands). Dumbbells (see Figure 20-1) give you more exercise options, and they force each side of your body to pull its own weight.\\n\\nFigure 20-1: Dumbbells give you a variety of exercise options.\\n\\nPhotograph by Sunstreak Productions, Inc.\\n\\nWhen it comes to buying dumbbells, you have two options. The best, most convenient option is to buy several pairs of dumbbells — 5-pound weights, 10-pounders, 12-pounders, 15-pounders, and so on. The cheap choice: Buy an adjustable dumbbell kit. A kit comes with two handles and several weight plates that you clamp onto each end of the handles with a clip or screw-type mechanism called a collar. These kits sell for $30 to $100, depending on the quality and the number of weight plates included.\\n\\nChapter 20: Designing a Home Gym\\n\\n319\\n\\nOwning a whole array of dumbbells saves you lots of time. Let’s say that you’re alternating shoulder exercises with 5-pound weights and chest exercises with 15-pound weights. All you have to do is put down the 5s and pick up the 15s. With adjustable dumbbells, you constantly have to remove the collar and add or subtract weight plates, which is a huge pain. You may be tempted to use the wrong weight because making the switch is a hassle. Also, locking the weights on securely can be difficult; they can jiggle around or, worse, slide off in the middle of your workout.\\n\\nA terrific product called PlateMates (www.theplatemate.com) can save you a lot of money on dumbbells. PlateMates are magnets that you stick onto each end of a dumbbell to increase the weight. The magnets come in four weights: 5⁄8 of a pound, 11⁄4 pounds, 17⁄8 pounds, and 21⁄2 pounds. With PlateMates, you cut down on the number of dumbbells you need to buy. For example, instead of buying a pair of 15-pounders, 20-pounders, and 25-pounders, you can pass on the 20s and create your own 20-pound weights by putting a 21⁄2-pound PlateMate on each end of the 15-pounders. You can stick the PlateMates on the 25-pounders to create 30-pound dumbbells, and so on. PlateMates come in different shapes to accommodate different styles of dumbbells. (However, they won’t attach to dumbbells coated in rubber, and the magnets may lose strength over time.) PlateMates cost $19 to $28 per pair. We recommend them in Chapter 25 as one of ten great fitness invest- ments under $100.\\n\\nIf you choose to buy separate dumbbells, realize that you’ll need eight or nine different pairs. Although some people use the 10-pound dumbbells for every exercise, this isn’t a good idea: A weight that’s heavy enough to chal- lenge your back muscles is much too heavy for your arm muscles; a weight that’s just right for your shoulders is too light to do your chest any good. If you want to see results, you need to give each muscle the right challenge\\n\\nFor most beginning women, we recommend buying dumbbells weighing 2, 3, 5, 8, 10, 12, 15, and 20 pounds. Even if you can’t use the 15s and 20s right away, you’ll grow into them pretty fast. The whole set costs between $60 and $150. As for beginning men, start off with 8, 12, 15, 20, 25, 30, 35, 40, 45, and 50 pounds. This set runs $200 to $600.\\n\\nShop around and try out different brands of dumbbells. Some have contoured handles that may feel more comfortable than straight ones. Some dumbbells have foam grips; others are coated in rubber. Dumbbells with hexagonal ends are great because they won’t roll away. A dumbbell rack is also a good idea. A rack can cost up to $200 but will keep your weights organized and your home gym looking tidy.\\n\\nIf you don’t have the space for a whole array of dumbbells but don’t want to fiddle with dumbbell kits, either, you have a couple other choices:\\n\\n320 Part VI: Conquering the Gym (Even at Home)\\n\\n(cid:2) Probell: Instead of buying six pair of dumbbells, from 5 pounds to 30 in 5-pound increments, you can buy one pair of Probells and get the same versatility. Instead of sliding weight plates on and off, you simply turn a dial to indicate how much weight you want to lift. Through a feat of engi- neering, the ProBell picks up the requested number of plates.\\n\\nJust note that ingenuity and space savings come at a price. The steel Probell set costs $199 — about twice the cost of six pairs of no-frills steel dumbbells. But you will save money on the higher end: The $249 chrome Probell costs less than a set of six shiny chrome dumbbells. The Probell stand costs an additional $149. See www.probell.com.\\n\\n(cid:2) PowerBlocks: Each block consists of a series of rectangular, weighted, metal frames, each one nesting inside a slightly larger frame. A series of holes runs along the outside of the frames; you insert a pin inside a hole to select the number of frames you’d like to pick up. You can buy a set of blocks that go from 5 pounds to 90 pounds in 5-pound increments, and you can change the weight instantly. PowerBlocks come with an optional stand and take up about the same amount of room as a telephone table. A 45-pound set sells for about $240; the 85-pound set sells for just under $600. Check out www.powerblock.com.\\n\\nPowerBlocks rattle around a bit more than ProBells, and their shape is more cumbersome, but PowerBlocks allow you to lift up to 90 pounds with each hand whereas ProBells go only up to 30 pounds.\\n\\nBarbells Most people can get along just fine with an array of dumbbells, but you can’t beat barbells for power lifts like bench pressing and squatting (see Chapter 14). Plus, barbells add even more variety to your workout. We recommend buying a single bar with a number of weight plates, because buying a whole assortment of bars is expensive. Bars typically run between $25 and $125, depending on the type of steel and where you buy the bar. Bars tend to cost more at specialty shops than at sporting goods stores.\\n\\nBars are typically 4 to 7 feet long and come in two sizes: the skinnier Standard (about 25 pounds) and the thicker Olympic (about 45 pounds). Plates (the round weights that you slide onto the bars) and collars (the clips that secure the plates) are designed to fit one bar size or the other, so make sure that you buy plates and collars that match your bar. We prefer Olympic bars because they’re more comfortable to wrap your hands around — they’re also the standard in most gyms.\\n\\nPurchasing a rack with your barbell is a good idea. Upright racks take up less room than horizontal ones. A one-bar rack can cost as little as $100.\\n\\nAs an alternative to traditional barbells, you can buy a series of lighter bars from 9 pounds to 27 pounds covered with comfortable rubber padding. One popular brand is Body Bar (www.bodybars.com). These bars are good for beginners. They allow you to learn to do barbell exercises without having to\\n\\nChapter 20: Designing a Home Gym\\n\\n321\\n\\nuse the heavier Standard or Olympic bars. The problem is, you can’t clip on weight plates, so you have to buy several bars to accommodate your various muscle groups. They’re not cheap either: A 12-pound Body Bar runs about $35. Plus, these bars don’t come in heavy enough weights for many interme- diate and advanced exercisers.\\n\\nWeight benches\\n\\nWhen you buy dumbbells and/or barbells, buy a bench, too. A bench lets you do many exercises that you couldn’t do otherwise. Doing free-weight exercises while lying on your back on the floor is difficult; your elbows may hit the ground before you complete the movement. You also can do several exercises while sitting or kneeling on a bench.\\n\\nIf you’re lifting dumbbells lighter than 30 pounds, you probably can get away with a plastic step platform rather than a full-fledged weight bench. With two sets of risers underneath, the platform is high enough and sturdy enough for light dumbbell exercises, but you may want to pad the step with a towel to provide cushioning on your back.\\n\\nIf you’re lifting heavier dumbbells or using barbells, buy a real weight bench. A bench is higher off the ground and more stable. We recommend benches that can be easily adjusted to incline or decline so you can challenge your muscles at different angles.\\n\\nLook for a bench with a thick foam pad covered with Naugahyde or imitation leather. The pad should be sturdily bolted to a steel frame and legs. A bench should be at least a few feet high and shouldn’t wobble when you get on and off. A basic flat bench goes for $50 to $300, depending on the quality and thickness of the padding, frame, and legs. We recommend paying a bit more for one that can be set at various inclines because it gives you the ability to vary your exercises. York and Hoist make good ones, but we really love Tuff Stuff benches (from $150 to $450) because they both incline and decline; most benches do one or the other, in which case a bench that inclines is more ver- satile than one that declines.\\n\\nMulti-gyms\\n\\nMulti-gyms are those contraptions that look like a bunch of health-club weight machines welded to each other (see Figure 20-2). Multi-gyms take up a lot of room — usually more than a stereo wall unit — and most require at least 7 feet of vertical clearance space. But many people prefer multi-gyms to free weights or bands because they’re so safe and easy to use. Most multi-gyms come with instructions — some even come with videos demonstrating all the different exercises you can do.\\n\\n322 Part VI: Conquering the Gym (Even at Home)\\n\\nFigure 20-2: Multi-gyms are safe and easy to use.\\n\\nPhotograph by Sunstreak Productions, Inc.\\n\\nA basic unit has one 200-pound stack of weight plates in 5- to 10-pound incre- ments. This means only one person can use the machine at a time. A basic multi-gym costs $800 to $3,500. If the whole family plans to work out together, you may want a multi-gym with two or three weight stacks, but these can run up to $10,000.\\n\\nGood high-end brands include Paramount, Pacific, Vectra, and California Gym. For reliable models under $1,000, look at Hoist and Bodyguard.\\n\\nWith the exception of the rather expensive Bowflex systems that many people swear by, we haven’t yet found a multi-gym sold on TV or in a department store or discount warehouse that isn’t cheaply made. They wobble, they’re poorly designed, and the resistance never moves as smoothly as a weight stack. Even some of the TV demonstrators can’t help arching their backs on some of the moves. And, sure, you may be able to do 52 exercises with one of these contraptions, but it’ll take you about 3 hours just to make the adjust- ments, which will give you one more reason to blow off your workout.\\n\\nTake your time shopping for a multi-gym. Try out a whole bunch of different machines, and pay attention to which exercises feel most comfortable. Multi- gyms that look the same sitting on the showroom floor may actually have\\n\\nChapter 20: Designing a Home Gym\\n\\n323\\n\\nimportant differences that you won’t notice until you use them. For example, some multi-gyms come with a horizontal chest press; others come with a ver- tical chest press. You have to decide whether you prefer to lie on your back and press upward, or sit up straight and press forward. Ask the equipment dealer to compare the different ways each multi-gym works each muscle group.\\n\\nHere’s a checklist to consult before you go shopping for a multi-gym. Inspect each machine carefully, and look for the following features:\\n\\n(cid:2) At least the chest/shoulder press, high pulley, low pulley, leg exten-\\n\\nsion, and leg curl exercise stations: Depending on the brand and model, you may also get chest butterfly, chin/dip, leg press, and abdominal board attachments. If these attachments aren’t included with the basic unit, they’re usually available as extra-cost options. Keep in mind that most multi-gyms require you to unsnap and rehook cables or arm posi- tions to switch between exercises; making all those adjustments can add extra minutes to your workout and interrupt the flow of your routine. (cid:2) Free assembly: Pass on any machine that the dealer doesn’t put together for you, especially if it comes with an “easy-to-follow” video on how to build it yourself.\\n\\n(cid:2) Weight stacks that move up and down smoothly: Test several exercises in the store to check for sticking points and levers that don’t allow you to fully straighten your arms and legs.\\n\\n(cid:2) A frame made of thick tubular or rectangular steel: The frame shouldn’t shake or wobble when you lean against it. Also, the frame should be painted or powder-coated to prevent chipping and rusting.\\n\\n(cid:2) Upholstery that’s sewn on securely: If you see corners that are curled\\n\\nat the edges, the upholstery probably will rip, tear, or unravel. The same goes for the rubberized padding around the foot rollers and other small parts. If it’s made from cheap, thin foam, chances are it will look chipped and beat-up after a few uses.\\n\\n(cid:2) Plates and cables made of quality materials: Avoid materials that look\\n\\nlike they’ll snap, fray, or crack.\\n\\n(cid:2) Adjustable seats and arms: If you can adjust the machine, the whole\\n\\nfamily can work out comfortably.\\n\\n(cid:2) A good warranty: The warranty should cover 10 years for the frame, 1 year for moving parts, and 90 days for upholstery. If you ask before you buy the machine, some dealers will give you an extended warranty at no cost. Don’t buy an extended warranty, however. They tend to be expen- sive and not worth the money.\\n\\n324 Part VI: Conquering the Gym (Even at Home)\\n\\nConsidering Flexibility Gadgets\\n\\nMost people get by just fine with fundamental stretching exercises that don’t use anything but body positioning and gravity. Still, there are some useful tools to help you work on your flexibility. If some of these gadgets get you to stretch when you otherwise wouldn’t, they’re worth the money. Here’s a look at some worthwhile investments:\\n\\n(cid:2) A stretching mat: You can use a thick towel or blanket to pad a hard\\n\\nfloor, but a mat is a more formal reminder to do your stretches, and you can use it for abdominal exercises and floor exercises, too. Some stretch- ing mats sell for more than $100, but we have no idea why. Just about any mat you come across will suffice. A top-of-the-line mat — one that’s cushiony and long enough so that your head isn’t hitting your wood floor — shouldn’t cost more than $60. Some can be folded in half for storage; others roll up.\\n\\n(cid:2) An oversized plastic ball: This is a safe way to improve the flexibility of your lower back. You can drape your body over it forward, backward, or sideways (see Figure 20-3). An oversized ball is also useful for abdominal and leg strengthening exercises. Expect to pay about $30.\\n\\nThe right fit is important. When you sit on the ball, your thighs should be roughly parallel to the floor. However, if you’re somewhat inflexible, get a slightly bigger ball. You won’t have to bend as far. Also, for stretch- ing, don’t inflate the ball all the way; it’ll be softer, easier to mold your body to, and less likely to roll away.\\n\\nFigure 20-3: An over- sized plastic ball is a nifty flexibility gadget, perfect for exercising during pregnancy.\\n\\nPhotograph by John Urban\\n\\nChapter 20: Designing a Home Gym\\n\\n325\\n\\n(cid:2) Stretching strap or rope: Use these nylon bands (Dynamic Stretching Strap or Stretch-Out Strap) when using the Active Isolated method of stretching (see Chapter 6). For $15 to $30 (including a video), you may want to own one, especially if you’re too stiff to get into certain stretch- ing poses. For example, if you’re sitting on the floor with one leg out and you can’t reach your toes, you wrap the strap around your instep and hold a loop in each hand. After holding that position for a while, if you can stretch a little farther, you can let your hands creep up to the loop that’s slightly closer to your toes. You can also buy a length of yachting rope at your local hardware store. Just buy a length twice your height. (cid:2) The Prostretch: This gadget is for stretching your calf and shin muscles and the sides of your ankles. The Prostretch is a shoe imprint cast in hard plastic and mounted on one or two curved rockers (wider versions of the rockers you find on rocking chairs). You place your foot on the imprint and drop your heel back toward the floor. Your toes point upward, giving you a terrific calf stretch. If you’re not very flexible, you can do this stretch while sitting down. Because the Prostretch supports your entire foot, you get a better calf stretch than if you just hang your feet off the curb, although most curbs won’t run you $25.\\n\\n(cid:2) Precor Stretch Trainer: This gizmo is a seat with handlebars and tilting capabilities so that you can lean backward and forward into a stretch. A combination of your body weight and gravity helps control the intensity of the stretch. By switching arm and leg positions, you can stretch nearly every muscle in your body without getting out of the seat. For example, to stretch your hamstrings, you place your leg up on the front of the seat and then lean back. (This mimics the stretch you do on the floor when you place one leg out in front of you then reach for your toe.) The han- dlebars have wrist straps so that you don’t go flying backward if you lose your balance. The gadget also has an adjustable safety pin to pre- vent less-than-graceful mounts.\\n\\nAt $700, the Stretch Trainer isn’t cheap, but it’s helpful for people who have trouble getting on and off the floor gracefully. It lets you stretch effectively without having to ask three close friends to help you stand up when you’re done stretching.

You discover that exercise isn’t only for 20-something\\n\\nsingles. Not by a long shot. In Chapter 21, you get a basic primer on exercising while pregnant, a growing (no pun intended) phenomenon that leads to healthier moms, easier deliveries, and healthy babies. In Chapter 22, you find out how to make exercise fun and exciting for your entire family, from toddlers to tweens to, yes, even teenagers. And we’re not just talking about healthy thumbs from playing video games. Chapter 23 helps you get and stay fit in your senior years, so that you can live out your retirement with health and vigor.\\n\\nChapter 21 Fit Pregnancy: Exercising for Two\\n\\nIn This Chapter (cid:1) Understanding why prenatal exercise is so good for you and your baby (cid:1) Getting the blessing of your healthcare provider (cid:1) Knowing how hard you can push yourself (cid:1) Taking important safety precautions (cid:1) Choosing the best activity for you (cid:1) Finding the best types of exercise for pregnancy\\n\\nAgeneration ago, the last place you’d find a pregnant woman was a health\\n\\nalmost an illness — a time to rest in bed, not strengthen your hamstrings. Doctors were afraid that exercise would cause birth defects and increase the rate of miscarriage, but they were just guessing. Now that scientists have actually researched these issues, they know it’s perfectly safe for most expec- tant moms to work out — as long as they exercise common sense and don’t try to set a world record in the high hurdles.\\n\\nclub or a running track. In those days, pregnancy was considered\\n\\nNot only is moderate exercise safe for the baby, it has also been shown to have tremendous benefits for mom. Compared to unfit pregnant women, regular exercisers tend to have fewer aches and pains, more self-esteem, and more energy and stamina, especially in the third trimester.\\n\\nRegular exercisers also have more confidence — and perhaps strength — during labor, and they seem to tolerate the pain better. One obstetrician we interviewed says his inactive patients tend to come to the hospital petrified, but his fit patients are fired up and ready for action. “For them, it’s like the Super Bowl,” the doctor says. “They say, ‘Stand back, let me go. I’m going to push this sucker out!’”\\n\\nSome research also suggests that fit women have shorter labors than unfit women and that they have a lower rate of C-section. But exercise doesn’t guarantee you a free ride in the delivery room. Even if you swim or walk until the day you give birth, you still may have the labor from hell. Some women\\n\\n330 Part VII: Exercising for All Ages and Stages\\n\\nare simply fated to a prolonged, agonizing labor, while others usher their little ones into the world relatively quickly. However, regardless of the labor experience, fit women do seem to bounce back from pregnancy a lot faster than their inactive counterparts.\\n\\nIs it safe to exercise during pregnancy if you’re not already in good shape? Yes, as long as you work out moderately and have your doctor’s okay. In fact, some doctors believe pregnancy is a terrific time to start working out. Entering labor in poor physical condition, they say, is like running the Boston Marathon without any training. It only makes sense to prepare your body for the mega- workout to come.\\n\\nIn this chapter, we offer a brief overview of a fit pregnancy, along with several safety precautions. For an in-depth look at the research supporting prenatal exercise, we recommend Fit Pregnancy For Dummies, by Catherine Cram and Tere Stouffer Drenth (published by Wiley), along with Exercising Through Your Pregnancy, by James Clapp III, M.D., a top prenatal exercise researcher and strong advocate of prenatal workouts.\\n\\nBe sure to get your doctor’s permission before embarking on a prenatal exer- cise program. Some high-risk conditions do rule out exercise during pregnancy.\\n\\nUnderstanding the Benefits of a Fit Pregnancy\\n\\nIn this short section, we fill you in on how staying fit during your pregnancy makes the entire 40 weeks easier to manage, brings you and your baby tremendous benefits, makes labor and delivery easier than for non-exercisers, and helps you go back to your pre-pregnancy weight and size after your baby is born.\\n\\nRead Fit Pregnancy magazine\\n\\nIf you expect to stay fit when you’re expecting, you can find no better source of information than Fit Pregnancy, the only magazine devoted to the concerns of pregnant women (and new moms) who exercise. A quarterly created by the editors of Shape, Fit Pregnancy (also at www.fitpregnancy.com) is full of great exercise ideas.\\n\\nThe magazine also provides the latest news on the research front. In addition, diet and nutrition are regular topics in Fit Pregnancy, as are sex and health issues such as genetic testing and infant vaccinations. Fit Pregnancy also rates exercise books and videos, maternity workout clothes, and running strollers.\\n\\nChapter 21: Fit Pregnancy: Exercising for Two\\n\\n331\\n\\nHere’s just some of what you’ll be doing if you stay fit during your pregnancy:\\n\\n(cid:2) Reducing back pain and soreness: As you likely already know, your\\n\\nbaby’s growing size puts pressure on your hips, butt, and back, which can lead to stiffness and soreness. When you exercise during pregnancy, you improve your posture and get your back, hip, and butt muscles in shape, thus reducing back pain and soreness.\\n\\n(cid:2) Gaining enough but not too much weight: We can’t stress enough that you absolutely need to gain weight during your pregnancy, because of the extra fat stores, body fluids, and blood your baby needs to grow properly — not to mention the weight of the child! But many women gain too much, and take years to lose that weight (or never do). Recent studies show that women who regularly exercise right up to the end of their pregnancies gain nearly 8 pounds less than non-exercising pregnant women, but were still well within the normal weight-gain limits for a healthy pregnancy.\\n\\n(cid:2) Getting good sleep: If you’re having trouble sleeping during your preg-\\n\\nnancy — as many women do — exercise can help you sleep more soundly at night and feel more awake during the day.\\n\\n(cid:2) Reducing delivery complications: Several studies show that women who exercise have fewer complications during delivery and generally need fewer drugs for pain relief.\\n\\n(cid:2) Reducing time spent in labor: One of the most stunning benefits of get- ting and staying fit during pregnancy is that labor is significantly shorter (by about one-third). Also, women who exercise tend to go into labor about five days earlier than women who don’t exercise, making pregnancy that much shorter.\\n\\n(cid:2) Having a leaner child: Studies show that women who exercise regularly during pregnancy have leaner (not low-birth-weight) babies, and this leanness continues by age 5. This starts your baby off on the right fit- ness foot from Day 1. See Chapter 22 for additional tips on helping kids get and stay fit.\\n\\n(cid:2) Quickly returning to your normal weight: Women who exercise during pregnancy have less weight to lose after they deliver and find that the weight comes off more easily than for women who don’t exercise.\\n\\nWorking with Your Healthcare Provider\\n\\nIf you’re pregnant, consult with your healthcare provider before starting an exercise program. Discuss your goals and the type of activity you plan to do, and get an okay from your physician or certified nurse-midwife before you to get started. The health of your child is more important right now than your fitness goals, so if your healthcare provider tells you not to work out, heed his warnings.\\n\\n332 Part VII: Exercising for All Ages and Stages\\n\\nThat said, some healthcare providers are still living with generations-old ideas about exercising during pregnancy. If you’ve educated yourself on the topic and feel as though your pregnancy would not be comprised by working out, give a copy of Fit Pregnancy For Dummies to your physician, and then meet with her to discuss the possibility. Reassure your physician that you’re willing to heed any and all warning symptoms, but if the pregnancy is otherwise pro- ceeding well, you’d like a chance to try to exercise during your pregnancy.\\n\\nGreat Activities to Consider During Pregnancy\\n\\nMany of the activities listed throughout this book are safe to do during your pregnancy, including those in the following sections.\\n\\nWalk this way\\n\\nSome women walk for exercise until the day of delivery. Runners may want to switch to a walk-run program or an all-walk routine if they find that running is just too hard on their lower back and knees. As your pregnancy progresses, avoid steep hills, which make your heart rate soar and may put more pressure on your lower back.\\n\\nPay special attention to your walking posture. Stand tall, with a natural S- curve to your back, and your shoulders back and down, not hunched. Lead with your chest. Keep your arms relaxed, and move them forward and back instead of swinging them across your body. Don’t walk in very hot or humid weather, because your heart rate elevates more rapidly and your body over- heats more quickly. And don’t walk when the ground is icy, because your sense of balance is not what it used to be. If the weather sends you indoors and onto a treadmill, hold on to the rails (but not with a death-grip). Treadmills require more balance than walking on the ground.\\n\\nMake sure that you wear supportive walking shoes. Because you weigh more than usual, your joints are under extra stress, and they need all the shock absorption they can get. Your feet may swell to the point where you need shoes a half-size bigger than usual.\\n\\nGetting into the swim of things\\n\\nSome pregnant women find walking uncomfortable, particularly in the third trimester, so they switch to lower-impact activities such as swimming. In fact,\\n\\nChapter 21: Fit Pregnancy: Exercising for Two\\n\\n333\\n\\nsome pregnant women say that the only time they feel really comfortable is in the water.\\n\\nWater workouts are great because you don’t have to worry about your balance. The water supports your weight and the weight of your baby, too, taking the stress off your lower back. Water also reduces the effect of gravity, lessening pressure on your joints. And nothing is more calming and soothing than glid- ing through the water; swimming can even help reduce pregnancy-related swelling. Plus, you can’t possibly fall while you’re in the water.\\n\\nMeanwhile, you can still get a great workout. You can run in the pool, swim laps, and tone your muscles with special equipment like webbed gloves and foam dumbbells. As your pregnancy progresses, you may need to modify your water workouts. Using a kickboard may become uncomfortable because it forces you to arch your back, which can trigger back pain. The frog kick (used in the breaststroke) may also cause discomfort. Don’t forget to drink water — you can get dehydrated even in the pool.\\n\\nPrenatal low-impact aerobics or yoga class\\n\\nMany health clubs and hospitals offer exercise classes specially designed for pregnant women and brand-new moms. Some classes stick to aerobic workouts; others include strength training, even yoga. Naturally, the exer- cises are adapted to the limitations of a pregnant body — including the loss of balance, shifting center of gravity, increased joint laxity (looseness), and reduced stamina.\\n\\nGuzzle water and don’t overheat\\n\\nPregnant or not, don’t exercise without a water bottle close at hand. When you’re responsible for someone else’s life, too, it’s especially impor- tant to stay healthfully hydrated. Dehydration is the number-one cause of cramps, particularly in your legs, and it can increase your blood pressure and heart rate, among other things. Always drink before you get thirsty — by the time your body demands, “Water, now!” you’re already at a fluid deficit.\\n\\nExercise in a well-ventilated area and make sure you wear clothes that breathe. Your baby’s\\n\\ntemperature depends entirely on your ability to cool your body. Extra-high body temperature irritates the fetus and can lead to premature labor. And keep drinking that water, which cools your body internally.\\n\\nAs a pregnant woman, you do have a built-in mechanism that allows you to reduce exercise- related heat stress. In fact, fit women tend to begin sweating at a lower temperature than inactive women. Still, this adaptation only works to a point, so use common sense.\\n\\n334 Part VII: Exercising for All Ages and Stages\\n\\nParticipants love these classes because the atmosphere is so much more sup- portive than it tends to be in regular classes. You don’t find a maniacal drill- sergeant instructor yelling, “Okay, today’s leg-lift-’til-you-drop day.” And you don’t find class members in two-piece leotards showing off their sculpted abs.\\n\\n“It was so great to be working out with other women who were as big as a house!” says our friend Dana, who switched from regular step aerobics to a prenatal aerobics class in her third trimester. “Before, I was always the one who had to stop early because I was too winded or my back hurt.” Prenatal exercise classes offer camaraderie and a chance to swap war stories about hemorrhoids, swollen ankles, and husbands who — try as they might — just don’t get it.\\n\\nContinue lifting weights\\n\\nIf you’ve never lifted weights before, pregnancy isn’t the time to start an unsupervised strength program. But if you know what you’re doing in the weight room or you’re experienced using dumbbells at home, you have no reason to quit your routine. And as long as you make the appropriate modifi- cations, there are plenty of great reasons to stick with it. (We don’t want to discourage novices from strength training during pregnancy, but you need to work with a trainer who’s very experienced with pregnant women or join a supervised, prenatal weight-training class at a health club.)\\n\\nActivities to avoid\\n\\nCertain activities just don’t mix with pregnancy, and that list usually includes the following: (cid:2) Scuba diving, due to the intense underwa- ter pressure, which is harmful to your baby. (cid:2) Water-skiing, during which you may fall. In addition, if less-than-clean lake or ocean water enters your vagina, you risk getting an infection.\\n\\n(cid:2) Contact sports, like soccer, volleyball, bas- ketball, and hockey introduce a major risk of falls and contact injuries.\\n\\n(cid:2) Downhill skiing, figure skating, horseback riding, and mountain biking, all because of the risk of falling.\\n\\n(cid:2) Cross-country skiing, rowing, and (some- times) running, because these can be very difficult activities that can overtax your body.\\n\\nRemember: Check with your healthcare provider for the final word.\\n\\nChapter 21: Fit Pregnancy: Exercising for Two\\n\\n335\\n\\nLiz’s friend Holly lifted weights through both of her pregnancies. Although she had to adapt her routine to avoid machines that she had trouble getting in and out of, she maintained her strength throughout the nine months. The combination of her buff arms and big belly was an inspiration to other preg- nant women.\\n\\nLifting weights during pregnancy not only keeps you looking terrific but helps cut down on general aches and pains and may even counteract some of the shoulder and back pain that can be caused by enlarged breasts and a growing uterus. Everyday activities won’t take as great a toll, and when the big day comes, you’ll have more strength to pick up your new bundle of joy (not to mention the diaper bag, stroller, car seat, bottles, and toys that you’ll be lug- ging around).\\n\\nYou do need to adapt your weight-training program to your ever-changing body. You may prefer machines to free weights, because they offer more support and require less balance. Of course, some machines won’t fit you anymore. When you’re seven months pregnant, you can’t exactly lie on your stomach and do hamstring curls. A couple of equipment manufacturers have taken care of this problem by designing a hamstring-curl machine that you use on your side. But most gyms don’t have special pregnancy equipment, so ask a trainer to show you more-practical alternatives to your regular routine. Many gyms have standing or seated hamstring machines.\\n\\nGive special attention to the muscles that are bearing the brunt of your tem- porary burden, such as those in your knees, ankles, and lower back. But if any exercise starts to feel uncomfortable, stop doing it. Any time that you feel dizziness, nausea, or a pulling in your abdomen, hips, pelvis, or elsewhere, choose a different exercise.\\n\\nWhen you’re pregnant, your goals in the weight room should change. Don’t focus on sculpting your muscles or setting a personal best in the bench press. Instead, aim to maintain your strength and enjoy the movement. Your last few repetitions of each set should be somewhat challenging, but they shouldn’t require all-out oomph. Expect to reduce the amount of weight you lift toward the end of your pregnancy, when you may have less energy. Breathe steadily and pay close attention to your form. Don’t grip the handles too hard — gripping too hard raises your blood pressure, which shoots up anyway when you exercise.\\n\\nMonitoring Your Prenatal Workout Routine\\n\\nUntil 1994, the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists (ACOG) insisted that a pregnant woman should not let her heart rate exceed 140\\n\\n336 Part VII: Exercising for All Ages and Stages\\n\\nbeats per minute. Many fit women found this guideline too restrictive; well- trained athletes have exercised during pregnancy with heart rates as high as 190, and without complications. However, most physicians, fearing malprac- tice suits, were reluctant to approve more-demanding exercise programs. In 1994, the ACOG released new guidelines, eliminating the heart-rate limitation and making many pregnant jocks happy.\\n\\nHowever, for a fitness novice, the 140 heart-rate guideline is a good one. (See Chapter 6 for details about monitoring your heart rate.) Pregnancy is not the time to figure out how fast you can run on the treadmill. If you don’t want to be bothered with heart-rate calculations, simply use the talk test: Don’t exer- cise so hard that you can’t hold up your end of a conversation. Ask your doctor for guidelines tailored to your fitness level. In general, let your body dictate how hard you push yourself, and cut yourself some slack. “I used to get down on myself because I couldn’t exercise at the same intensity when I was pregnant,” says our friend Elise. “I’d have to stop and rest all the time in my aerobics class. But finally I realized that going hard wasn’t the point. I said, ‘Hey, at least I’m here!’”\\n\\nThroughout any prenatal workout, look for the following signs of overtraining and report them as soon as possible to your healthcare provider:\\n\\n(cid:2) Pain: Anytime you begin an exercise program, you experience some\\n\\nsoreness. However, if exercise hurts in any way, stop exercising and call your healthcare provider.\\n\\n(cid:2) Fatigue: If you find yourself feeling overly fatigued throughout the\\n\\nday — and not just when you’re exercising — take a day off and relay this information to your healthcare provider at your next appointment.\\n\\n(cid:2) Overheating: If you find yourself sweating a great deal, getting exces- sively hot, feeling faint, getting nauseated while working out, and/or becoming lightheaded, stop exercising, drink plenty of fluids, rest, and call your healthcare provider.\\n\\nNever work out during the hottest times of the day and avoid indoor exercise in an area that isn’t well ventilated.\\n\\n(cid:2) Dehydration: Getting dehydrated is bad for you — and your baby. Keep a water bottle with you throughout much of the day, and check the color of your urine — the lighter and clearer the better — each time you go to the bathroom. (Keep in mind, however, that early-morning urine tends to be dark or orange even if you are hydrating enough, so don’t use early- morning urine as a guide.) If your urine looks gold-colored or orangey, you need to drink more fluids. If adding more water to your daily routine doesn’t help, ask your healthcare provider for advice at your next appointment.\\n\\nChapter 21: Fit Pregnancy: Exercising for Two\\n\\n337\\n\\nThe key to exercising during pregnancy is modifying your workout routine whenever anything doesn’t feel quite right. In addition to the general signs of overtraining just listed, also look for the following warning signs. If you experience any of these, call your healthcare provider immediately.\\n\\n(cid:2) Contractions: Contractions are a positive sign only if you’re within a week or two of your due date. Otherwise, contractions may indicate premature labor.\\n\\n(cid:2) Dizziness: This could be a sign of anemia (low red-blood-cell count that\\n\\nresults in weakness and fatigue) or other conditions.\\n\\n(cid:2) Dyspnea: If you’re experiencing dyspnea, you may have shortness of\\n\\nbreath or rapid and shallow breathing.\\n\\n(cid:2) Headache: Although many pregnant women report an increase in\\n\\nheadaches during their pregnancies (often brought on by fatigue and stress), if you experience a severe headache or a less severe one that doesn’t seem to go away, contact your healthcare provider. Headaches can be an early sign of preeclampsia (pregnancy-induced high blood pressure).\\n\\n(cid:2) Increased swelling in your legs: This could be a sign of preeclampsia, which is characterized by high blood pressure and fluid retention and can be quite serious. It could also indicate deep-vein thrombosis, a blood clot that develops in a vein.\\n\\nDon’t lie on your back after the first trimester\\n\\nStarting around the fourth month, you may feel dizzy when you lie on your back. This means that your little one is pressing on your inferior vena cava, a major vein that carries blood to your heart. You can modify exercises in a number of ways to avoid this dizziness. For example, if you want to do abdominal exercises on your back, place a folded towel or small blanket underneath one hip. This shifts your body slightly, rolling the baby off the vein. Also, you can do several pregnancy exercises with your back against the wall or while standing or sitting in a chair. In addition, you can do gentle\\n\\nexercises with a physioball — a large, inflated ball that looks like a sturdy beach ball.\\n\\nOne friend of ours took a physioball with her into the delivery room. When she went into back labor (when the baby presses heavily against your spine, creating agonizing back pain), she placed the ball against the wall and pressed her back against it. By rolling the ball around on the wall and allowing it to massage her back, she was able to work through most of the pain. She did get some funny looks from the nurses, but when they saw it was working, they thought it was a great idea.\\n\\n338 Part VII: Exercising for All Ages and Stages\\n\\n(cid:2) Muscle weakness: Muscle weakness can take a couple of different forms: total-body weakness (in which you feel weak all over) or specific muscle weakness (such as your right arm or the left side of your body). (cid:2) Vaginal bleeding and/or leaking of amniotic fluid: Leaking blood or other fluids can be the result of several complications, including pla- centa previa (in which the placenta, the organ that grows in your uterus to provide nutrients for the fetus and eliminate its waste, blocks all or part of the cervix), placenta abruption (separation of the placenta from the uterus before delivering your baby), premature labor, and miscarriage. (cid:2) You can’t feel your baby moving: If your baby’s normal movements (that you usually begin feeling between the 18th and 22nd weeks) have dimin- ished or stopped, your baby may be experiencing problems. Keep in mind that your baby will probably be calm during exercise, but you should start to feel several movements again within 20 to 30 minutes after you stop.\\n\\nKeep Exercising after the Baby Arrives\\n\\nWorking out may seem like a pretty tall order when you’re getting two hours of sleep a night and your body feels like it’s been through the spin cycle. But even short, easy workouts like a ten-minute walk help you sustain energy (at a time when you really need it), and exercise may help you sleep better at night. Exercise also can help you cope with the depression that sometimes results from sleep deprivation.\\n\\nBut don’t rush back into exercise. There’s no need to force yourself into any- thing at a time when a walk to the bathroom may seem like an athletic feat worthy of an Olympic medal. As soon as you feel ready (a few days or weeks after delivery and only after checking with your doctor), try to start a simple routine, such as daily walking. Gradually work up to brisk walks with your baby in the stroller. Consider buying a baby jogger or a special cart that will attach to your bicycle so you can safely take your screamer along for the ride.\\n\\nSix weeks after an uncomplicated birth — or sooner if your doctor okays it — you can begin more vigorous activity, like swimming, running, or lifting weights. Just make sure you start back slowly. Your abdominal muscles have been stretched, which means they aren’t supporting your back as much as they were before you got pregnant. Check with your doctor before you begin your routine again.\\n\\nPostpartum exercise makes you feel better, but don’t expect it to speed up the weight-loss process. The research is inconclusive, but it appears that if you eat regularly and exercise after giving birth, you go through the same weight-loss patterns as women who don’t exercise. In other words, it still takes about six months to a year to return to your pre-pregnancy weight and body composition. But you can start regaining your aerobic fitness a lot faster.\\n\\nChapter 22 Kids, Tweens, and Teens: Fun Activities for the Whole Family\\n\\nIn This Chapter (cid:1) Establishing a fitness mindset early in life (cid:1) Catching the energy of preteens (cid:1) Overcoming fitness objections with teenagers\\n\\nStatistics on childhood obesity are startling: More than one out of every\\n\\nseven kids in the United States is overweight or obese, and that number climbs every year. As a result of too little exercise and too many calories, these kids are also developing serious diseases: high blood pressure, adult-onset diabetes, and arthritis, for example.\\n\\nThe most effective way to combat poor fitness in your kids is to take a dual approach:\\n\\n(cid:2) Tap into your child’s natural love of activity. Kids love to play, indoors or out, and all that “playing” is really just exercise. Ultimately, any kind of activity is exercise (running, climbing, playing tag, skipping, dancing, swimming), so getting kids, especially young kids, to be active isn’t usu- ally a problem.\\n\\nIf you think of exercise as drudgery, however, and if you present exercise to your kids in this light, you’ll likely turn off any natural desire they have for a high level of activity. If you regularly play with your kids — from kicking a soccer ball around to jumping rope to hiking — and make it a priority, your kids will be hooked on exercise within just a few weeks. (cid:2) Turn your kids on to healthy foods. When you stock your fridge and cup-boards with the healthiest, freshest, most delicious foods you can afford, your child’s acquired taste for fats and sugars will quickly disap- pear. Many parents believe that if they don’t offer their kids all the pizza, cookies, and salty snacks they want, their kids will go hungry. And, sure, if you fill your cupboards with tofu and green tea, you’ll likely encounter\\n\\n340 Part VII: Exercising for All Ages and Stages\\n\\nresistance. But having access to whole fruits, easy-to-grab veggies, fat- free yogurt, low-salt and high-fiber snack foods, and a range of other healthy foods helps “train” your child’s appetite in the direction of nutritious foods.\\n\\nTry to get outside with your kids every day, at least for a few minutes. Sure, driving home after a long day and finding your child waiting to ride bikes or shoot baskets is tough. But spending time exercising with your child is a wonderful way to get to know and connect with your child and, just as importantly, turn your child on to the routine of regular exercise.\\n\\nGetting Your Toddler Outdoors\\n\\nGetting your toddler outdoors is like getting a bird to fly — it’s just so natural that many kids wouldn’t dream of not doing it. Consider, for example, the fol- lowing outdoor games kids are motivated to play (and notice that they all do qualify as “exercise” because they build stronger, leaner bodies):\\n\\n(cid:2) Playing soccer, Wiffle ball, and kickball (cid:2) Climbing trees, monkey bars, and jungle gyms (cid:2) Jumping rope (cid:2) Playing hopscotch (cid:2) Riding a tricycle (cid:2) Taking adventure walks in the woods (also known as hiking and\\n\\nsnowshoeing)\\n\\nYet a toddler who is used to spending most of the day watching TV may think the outdoors is a foreign country, where she doesn’t dare venture. It’s up to you to change that mindset, showing your child how much more fun playing is than watching Nickelodeon.\\n\\nTaking your kids along on your fitness routine\\n\\nWorking out with a baby is pretty simple: Put your baby in a playpen and start your aerobics DVD, or set her in a baby seat and pedal your bike for an hour. When she weighs just 15 or 20 pounds, sleeps a lot, and is happy just to be in the same room as you, your workout options are fairly broad.\\n\\nChapter 22: Kids, Tweens, and Teens: Fun Activities for the Whole Family\\n\\n341\\n\\nBut life can be different with a toddler. Your 2- or 3-year-old feels very grown up, and she wants to come along with you, at her untimed, relatively unmoti- vated pace. If you bring her along, you may feel as though your workout will suffer, but if you leave her at home, you’re missing a tremendous opportunity to get her hooked on lifelong fitness. What’s a fit parent to do?\\n\\nBring her along. Although you may decide to supplement with an extra work- out on your own a few days per week, you can “work out” with your toddler and still stick to your exercise goals. You just have to change your mindset about what defines “exercise.” If you’re a runner, what about playing 20 min- utes of tag, instead, in which you do most of the running around and take long loops around your yard? If you like to walk, what about alternating ten minutes of power walking with your toddler in the running stroller with five minutes of strolling hand-in-hand with your child, and repeating this three or four times? If you normally do aerobics, what about putting on some danceable music and cutting a rug with your child?\\n\\nFocusing on fun\\n\\nYour mission, should you choose to accept it, is to help your child decide how she defines “fun,” and proceed accordingly. Don’t get too tied up in exer- cise as you may define it — no toddler ever needs to work out on an elliptical trainer or treadmill. But skipping, hiking, dancing, playing pool games, prac- ticing gymnastics, playing soccer, and doing a host of other activities keep kids moving.\\n\\nAvoiding fast food\\n\\nRecent studies at Children’s Hospital in Boston found that children consumed enough extra calories (calories above what they need for normal growth) during fast-food meals to add six extra pounds per year. In ten years, that makes your child 60 pounds overweight! This study of over 6,000 children also found that kids who eat fast food also tend to eat more fats and sugars and fewer fruits and vegetables, than kids who don’t eat fast food.\\n\\nsit-down restaurant or cooking meals at home. In fact, toddlers love to help cook meals with you, and with just a little training from you on kitchen safety, they can handle a variety of easy food-preparation chores.\\n\\nWhen you have to eat fast food, choose grilled chicken sandwiches, turkey subs with whole- wheat bread, baked potatoes (with low-fat sour cream and crunchy veggie toppings), and salads (minus the cheese).\\n\\nAvoid making fast food a family “treat” — you can do better making healthy choices at a\\n\\n342 Part VII: Exercising for All Ages and Stages\\n\\nWhen it looks like exercise, smells like exercise, and tastes like exercise, it’s probably exercise. You won’t fool your child by taking an inherently boring activity — say, running on a treadmill or swimming laps — and repackaging it by calling it a game. The point is to actually play a game (soccer, say, or sharks-and-minnows) with your child and dispense with adult ideas about exercise. You may enjoy power walking, but your child probably won’t; instead, you can both build strength and become more energized by playing a game of duck, duck, goose with you and the neighborhood kids.\\n\\nFocus on fun, and you and your child will both get a great workout in the process. Don’t worry about technique or pace; instead, just keep moving and having fun. If your child tires after 10 or 15 minutes, that’s okay; you and your child may be able to get in three 15-minute, no-pressure game-playing sessions every day, and when totaled, that’s an impressive amount of exercise for both of you.\\n\\nAlthough you can certainly suggest games and activities, let your toddler have the final word on which activity you choose. You may end up playing hopscotch every day for a month, but if you force your desires and expecta- tions on your child, you risk suffocating her natural love of activity. Let her call the shots, and you can just go along for the ride.\\n\\nFinding Time with Your Preteen\\n\\nAs your child grows, playing becomes less “cool.” In elementary school, many kids take three recess breaks; by middle school, this drops to one or even zero. Hanging out at the mall with friends, not jumping rope on the play- ground, is the order of the day. So, how do you get your tween to exercise?\\n\\nThe answer lies in how you present exercise to your child. If you say, “Come on, sweetie, let’s go run for 40 minutes in 30-degree weather,” your kid is likely to run to the house of a friend whose parents stock entire boxes of Hostess Ding-Dongs. The trick with tweens is the following:\\n\\n(cid:2) Make it fun, not drudgery. Let your child choose the activity you’ll do together and just go along for the ride. Have some suggestions in mind, however, so that you don’t spend half an hour trying to decide how to spend your half-hour exercise session together.\\n\\n(cid:2) Make it cool. The definition of cool depends on your child, so ask. You may even want to seek your child’s advice on how to dress for your workouts, just so you don’t mortify him if his friends see you together.\\n\\nChapter 22: Kids, Tweens, and Teens: Fun Activities for the Whole Family\\n\\n343\\n\\nMaking good school lunch choices\\n\\nKeep this rule in mind: You can always prepare a more nutritious sack lunch for your child than she can get at school. The “hot” in “hot lunch” is not synonymous with “healthy.” It’s just hot. And kids can make their own lunches, too, start- ing at around second grade. Make them together for a while, and then let her take over for herself.\\n\\nEven when your child takes her own lunch, though, she still may be beckoned by incredibly unhealthy choices in her school’s vending\\n\\nmachines. If this is the case at your child’s school, get involved and lobby your school dis- trict to offer only healthy foods to children. Meet with the principal or superintendent, attend school-board meetings, start a petition — do what you have to in order to give your child healthy food options throughout the day. If the Los Angeles and New York City public schools can cut unhealthy foods out of their vending machines, so can your school.\\n\\n(cid:2) Involve as many of your tween’s friends as possible (as long as you’ve\\n\\nfollowed the preceding rule about making it cool).\\n\\n(cid:2) Encourage participation in school, church, and community sports\\n\\nteams. Chances are, you can find a team that’s playing soccer, basketball, t-ball, football, hockey, and any number of other sports in your area. Tweens usually have a lot of fun in organized sports, meeting other kids their age, developing athletic skills, and discovering the ins and outs of working as a team.\\n\\nLeaving the car behind\\n\\nIf you have a tween, chances are, you spend a lot of time playing chauffeur to your child and her friends. An exceptional way to help your child become healthier is to substitute walking or bike riding for many of these car-intensive errands. Going to dance lessons? Hop on your bikes and ride the 2 miles to the studio. Heading to the bookstore or library? Stroll there and back. If you live too far to comfortably walk or ride, consider packing your bikes into your car, parking a mile or two away, and pedaling around while you do errands together.\\n\\nWhether you’re heading to school, the park, or a friend’s house, use the car as your last option. When you do drive, park as far away from the building as possible to give you and your tween a chance to stretch your legs a bit. Be\\n\\n344 Part VII: Exercising for All Ages and Stages\\n\\nsure she understands that you’re not just being the least cool parent in the world by parking way off in one corner, but that exercise is important to you, and you want to use your legs to get you around whenever possible.\\n\\nCutting back on TV and video games\\n\\nAfter a hard day at work, you just want to sink into the recliner, grab the remote, and veg out, right? Well, maybe. Taking time to relax each day is, of course, absolutely necessary in life. But spending hours in front of the TV is often more a matter of habit than necessity, and your kids will follow your lead. Watching TV and playing video games is fun — no doubt about it — but so is playing a game of pick-up basketball, taking a walk through town, playing touch football, riding bikes, and climbing trees. If you can limit the amount of time you spend in front of the TV — and we’re talking about really limiting it, say, to a half-hour per day — you can open up precious hours to play, talk as a family, finish homework, read quietly, and so on.\\n\\nIt’s no great irony that, as TV viewing increases, so do obesity levels.\\n\\nConnecting with Your Teenager\\n\\nBy their teenage years, your kids have settled into a routine — often one of two routines: as active teenagers who participate in several school sports or as fairly inactive teens. If your teen is of the inactive variety, or is active for one or two school sports seasons but not year-round, you can help your child become more active by taking a few simple steps, discussed in the following sections.\\n\\nPlanning new traditions\\n\\nDoes your family’s routine center around food and comfort, or are you an active family that heads out the door whenever possible? Whatever your current routine, talk to your teen about some new traditions you can put into place.\\n\\n(cid:2) Is Saturday morning a time for sausage and pancakes? What about\\n\\nreplacing that with a brisk walk to the local coffee shop or a bike ride around the city?\\n\\n(cid:2) Are birthdays usually celebrated with a heavy meal and rich birthday cake? What about taking your teen out of school at lunchtime on his birthday and heading to the nearest city or state park for an afternoon hike, complete with a picnic lunch?\\n\\nChapter 22: Kids, Tweens, and Teens: Fun Activities for the Whole Family\\n\\n345\\n\\n(cid:2) When you go to the mall, do you and your kids spend more time in the food court than you do strolling around? If so, consider eating before heading out the door and/or walking two laps around the entire mall before heading into any stores. Or reward yourselves for getting through your holiday shopping by stopping at the Y for a swim or a game of pick- up basketball.\\n\\n(cid:2) Is the time between Thanksgiving and New Year’s Day a routine of too\\n\\nmany cookies and candies, rich holiday meals, and inactivity? What hap- pens if you just don’t buy or make any holiday treats, focusing instead on stocking up on holiday fruits, such as sweet, delicious Clementine tangerines or Pink Lady apples? And how about if you spend holiday mornings taking a brisk walk (with snowshoes, in certain climates) or going sledding? Can you invite your teen’s friends over for a basketball or Ping-Pong tournament on Thanksgiving afternoon?\\n\\n“Tradition” doesn’t have to be synonymous with “unhealthy habits.” Instead, talk to your teen about how, together, you can change your routine in fun, creative ways. Although you may not be able to pull your family away from the traditional Thanksgiving football game, you may be able to get your kids to toss a football around with you during halftime.\\n\\nLetting your teen find his groove\\n\\nIf your teen is active in school sports, you’re facing one of parenting’s tough- est tests. You have to fully support your child by purchasing equipment and paying for camps and other sports fees, attending as many events as possible, giving rides to and from practices, and so on. But after that, you have to back off. No matter how badly you want your child to be the next city swim champ or earn a sports scholarship to college, no amount of cajoling, pressuring, or forcing your teen through extra workouts will make that happen.\\n\\nFew kids will grow up to be the next Mia Hamm or Tiger Woods. If your teen wants to devote herself to one sport and pursue it passionately, support that without reservation — you’ll spend countless dollars and hours supporting your child in that endeavor. But if she loses interest or decides to try a vari- ety of sports, allow her to enjoy that process, because along the way, she’ll develop lifelong friendships and internalize valuable lessons about teamwork and etiquette. Very few kids who are forced into one particular sport stick with it very long.\\n\\nIf your child opts out of school sports completely, you have a rare opportu- nity on your hands to work out together, if she agrees. Choose any activity that appeals to both of you (from yoga to in-line skating and everything in between), make sure you both have the best equipment you can afford, and focus on having fun together — not so much on heart rate, workout intensity, and calories burned.\\n\\n346 Part VII: Exercising for All Ages and Stages\\n\\nHealthy eating, teenage-style\\n\\nTo encourage healthy eating among the teenage set, you have to master snacks. The term snack food probably conjures images of chips, cookies, and bite-size pizza treats, but a snack is, technically, just something to tide you over between meals. Although no teenager is likely to come home from school and lick his lips at the prospect of a steaming plate of broc- coli, you can provide a variety of healthier snacks that your teen will go for. Here are some examples: (cid:2) Veggie pizzas made with low-fat cheese (cid:2) Soups and chili made with poultry breasts, ground turkey breast, and other low-fat meats\\n\\n(cid:2) Fat-free or low-fat ranch dressing with carrot and celery sticks, broccoli crowns, cherry tomatoes, and any other veggies he likes\\n\\n(cid:2) Grapes, apple chunks, orange sections, bananas, peaches, pears, plums, and any other fruits that appeal to him\\n\\n(cid:2) Dried raisins, dates, prunes, and any other\\n\\ndried fruit without added sugar\\n\\n(cid:2) Crackers low in fat and salt and high in fiber, rice or corn cakes, a non-trans-fat popcorn\\n\\n(cid:2) 100 percent juice drinks (cid:2) Natural peanut butter on whole-wheat\\n\\ncrackers, apples, or bananas\\n\\n(cid:2) String cheese and whole-grain RyKrisp\\n\\ncrackers\\n\\n(cid:2) Low-fat or fat-free pudding cup or yogurt (cid:2) Trail mix (cid:2) Low-fat ice cream sandwiches (cid:2) Frozen yogurt (cid:2) Low-fat chips and salsa (cid:2) Hummus and whole-wheat pita, cut into\\n\\nwedges\\n\\n(cid:2) Nuts or sunflower seeds (cid:2) Low-fat hot chocolate or latte\\n\\nChapter 23 Staying Active as You Age\\n\\nIn This Chapter (cid:1) Understanding the benefits of senior fitness (cid:1) Getting started in an exercise program (cid:1) Using some caution as you exercise (cid:1) Knowing where to focus your efforts\\n\\nment, relaxation, and all those lovely 10-percent-off discounts! But many seniors suffer through a variety of ailments and health problems, losing vigor and strength too quickly.\\n\\nYour senior years are what you’ve looked forward to all your life: retire-\\n\\nThe secret to aging slowly and with good health is fitness. By staying active as you age, you reap substantial benefits, from looking and feeling young to staving off life-threatening diseases. In this chapter, you discover those bene- fits, find out how to get started, and take in a few safety tips.\\n\\nKeeping Yourself Young with Exercise\\n\\nIf you’re among the many seniors who think fitness is only for a younger crowd, think again. The Journal of Gerontology recently released a study showing that people over age 60 can train just as hard as younger folks and derive the same benefits from exercise as people far younger.\\n\\nThe benefits of beginning or continuing to exercise in your senior years are phenomenal, not the least of which is making you feel 10 to 25 years younger. Consider the extent to which your life can be enhanced by the combination of cardio workouts (like walking or cycling) and strength training (lifting weights) several days per week:\\n\\n(cid:2) You have more energy. (cid:2) You experience less depression and anxiety. (cid:2) You have an easier time losing weight.\\n\\n348 Part VII: Exercising for All Ages and Stages\\n\\n(cid:2) You increase bone density, build muscle strength, and slow the muscle\\n\\ndeterioration that comes with age.\\n\\n(cid:2) You improve your balance, which may prevent the falls that cause\\n\\nhip fractures.\\n\\n(cid:2) You reduce lower-back pain (this is especially true if you’re\\n\\nlifting weights).\\n\\n(cid:2) You boost your immune system. (cid:2) You lower your blood pressure. (cid:2) You substantially cut your risk of heart disease, arthritis, diabetes, colon\\n\\ncancer, and Alzheimer’s and dementia.\\n\\n(cid:2) Your mind is more alert. (cid:2) You can be more independent in your daily activities.\\n\\nIf you saw a pharmaceutical advertisement that listed even half of those ben- efits, you’d be lining up at your doctor’s office for a prescription. So here’s your exercise Rx: See your doctor for a checkup, and then, no matter what your age or experience with exercise, begin doing small amounts of cardio exercises (see Part III), strength training (see Part IV), or a combination (see Part V), three to five days per week. As your soreness wears off and your fitness improves, lengthen your workout times, improve your pace, and increase the amount of weight you’re lifting. And be sure to stretch daily (see Chapter 6).\\n\\nKnowing Where to Begin\\n\\nDo you find the idea of exercise daunting and just don’t know where to start? You’re not alone: 85 percent of all seniors don’t exercise regularly. If that sounds like you, you’ve come to the right place: this book. Just about all the information throughout this book applies to you, and you can visit the chap- ters that make the most sense to you. So, if you’ve never worked out before, flip to Chapter 2 for information on assessing your current fitness, and then jump to Chapter 3 for tips on setting workout goals.\\n\\nOne of the major reasons seniors don’t stick to a workout program is a lack of immediate results. Don’t fall for this trap! Getting fit does take time, but if you’re doing a combination of cardio and weight training, you may notice small differences in just a week or two. After a month, your clothes may fit better, and within two or three months, your grandchildren will wonder how you’re able to keep up with them. Exercise is its own fountain of youth, and while the magic potion does take a little time to make its way into your system, if you find an exercise you enjoy and stick with it, you’ll be whistling a happy tune before you know it.\\n\\nChapter 23: Staying Active as You Age\\n\\n349\\n\\nCardio workouts for a healthy heart\\n\\nBecause cardio workouts (short for cardiovascular, the system that includes your heart and lungs) help lower your heart rate, improve your lung function, and make you feel more energized, be sure to include cardio as a part of your overall workout plan. Chapter 8 explains what is and isn’t a cardio exercise, how hard to push yourself when you’re exercising, and how many minutes or miles you need to work out to reap the benefits.\\n\\nIf you want the lowdown on cardio machines, like treadmills, elliptical train- ers, stair climbers, and indoor bikes, move over to Chapter 9, which outlines those machines in detail. That chapter also helps you combat boredom, giving you tips on how to keep from staring at the same spot on the wall for 20 solid minutes.\\n\\nIf you want to combine a cardio workout with resistance training (see the following section), consider trying circuit training, which we discuss in Chapter 15.\\n\\nFinding a gym that caters to you\\n\\nYou won’t find many seniors-only gyms, but with a little effort, you can likely find a gym that caters to your unique needs. Chapter 18 is all about finding and choosing the right gym, so if you’re interested in joining a gym, take a few minutes to peruse that chapter. When visiting local gyms, ask the following questions: (cid:2) Does anyone on staff carry any senior-fit- ness certification or other designation? Several of the governing bodies that certify personal trainers (see Chapter 4) offer train- ing in senior fitness, and you want to have access to a trainer who has taken advan- tage of these educational opportunities. (cid:2) Do any of your classes specialize in senior fitness? From water aerobics to Pilates,\\n\\nyoga to marathon-training groups, some health clubs offer special classes and group activities for seniors. If your local gym doesn’t offer senior classes, check with your local YMCA, community health pro- gram, running or walking specialty store, and local churches.\\n\\n(cid:2) Do you offer senior discounts? Hey, if you’re paying 25 percent less for a movie, you should also get a discount on your gym membership, right? Don’t be shy about asking for discounts. They may not be advertised, but if you ask, you may just receive a substantial discount on your membership fee.\\n\\n350 Part VII: Exercising for All Ages and Stages\\n\\nResistance training for strength\\n\\nIf you figure weight lifting is only for young, hot, bodybuilder types, get your- self to Chapter 11, which explains the surprising benefits of resistance train- ing. The bottom line? Adding two or three days of weight training makes you stronger and allows you to eat more calories without gaining weight. And no, for most people, weight training doesn’t create bulging biceps and puffed-up pecs. You will tone and sculpt your muscles, however. If you’re unsure how to use weight-training equipment, flip to Chapter 13. Chapter 14 helps you design your own strength-training program.\\n\\nOne of the major benefits of resistance training is that you improve your over- all strength, which gives you more independence in your life. From carrying in groceries from the car to moving furniture around when it suits you, having greater strength allows you to do more without waiting for your son-in-law to show up.\\n\\nPilates for balance\\n\\nEach year, one in four people over age 65 experiences a serious fall, which can lead to an injury that limits your mobility. Thankfully, beginning and maintaining a fitness routine reduces your chances of falling and makes you more likely to “catch” yourself if you do fall. Both cardio workouts and weight training can improve your balance, but Pilates, the subject of Chapter 17, puts special emphasis on your body’s core — that is, your abdominal, back, hip, butt, and other nearby muscles — which, when strong, can greatly improve your overall balance.\\n\\nConsider taking a Pilates class or using a Pilates video one or two days per week. This form of exercise can be challenging to master at first (see Chapter 17 for examples of the exercises), but it builds core strength and improves balance so well that you may wonder how you ever lived without it. Also check out Chapter 19 for information on BOSU, a cardio workout that’s well known for developing balance and flexibility.\\n\\nStretching and yoga for flexibility\\n\\nStretching, whether through the stretches in Chapter 6 or through a yoga rou- tine (see Chapter 16), can prevent your ligaments and muscles from shorten- ing, which is the primary cause of walking like the Hunchback of Notre Dame. We recommend stretching or doing some simple yoga exercises every day, even on the days you don’t otherwise exercise. After you get yourself into the routine, you may find that stretching — and the wonderful relaxation you feel as a result — is your favorite part of your day.\\n\\nChapter 23: Staying Active as You Age\\n\\n351\\n\\nStaying Safe\\n\\nBefore beginning an exercise program, make an appointment with your health- care provider, just to cover your bases. As you get yourself into a workout routine, keep the following safety tips in mind:\\n\\n(cid:2) Always warm up and cool down (see Chapter 8); stretch as often as\\n\\npossible (see Chapter 6).\\n\\n(cid:2) Check that you can carry on a conversation while exercising. If speaking\\n\\nis difficult, reduce your intensity or stop exercising.\\n\\n(cid:2) Never hold your breath while exercising, especially while lifting weights. (cid:2) Keep yourself hydrated (see Chapter 7). Remember that by the time you\\n\\nfeel thirsty, you’ve started to become dehydrated.\\n\\n(cid:2) In hot weather, wear high-tech fabrics that let heat escape, and always\\n\\nwear sunscreen and a baseball cap or visor.\\n\\n(cid:2) During winter, layer your clothing so you can remove layers as your\\n\\nbody heats up.\\n\\n(cid:2) When you have a cold or — worse yet — the flu, take a few days off of\\n\\nyour exercise routine.\\n\\n(cid:2) Stop exercising if you feel any of the following:\\n\\nNausea, faintness, lightheadedness\\n\\nRacing pulse or any abnormal heart rate\\n\\nCold sweat\\n\\nChest or neck pain or tightness\\n\\nMuscular pain\\n\\nExcessive fatigue or weakness\\n\\nUsing exercise as a social event\\n\\nExercise is a great way to meet and spend time with people of all ages, especially if you join a gym or a fitness group. If you don’t have a gym in your town, check with your local community center to see what classes or workout groups meet in the area — or start your own running\\n\\nor cycling club with friends and family. From meeting new friends at the gym to walking with your grandchildren a few days per week, you can use exercise as an opportunity for social interaction.\\n\\n352 Part VII: Exercising for All Ages and Stages\\n\\nPart VIII The Part of Tens\\n\\nIn this part . . . We carry on the For Dummies tradition of grouping\\n\\nkey information in fun, easy-to-skim lists of ten. Just in case you’re not sure why exercise is worth your time, Chapter 24 presents ten (well, actually far more than ten) reasons to break a sweat. Chapters 25 and 26 fill you in on the best and worst ways to spend your fitness dollars. Finally, Chapter 27 gives you ten great strategies for staying motivated to work out.\\n\\nChapter 24 Ten Great Reasons to Break a Sweat\\n\\nIn This Chapter (cid:1) Decreasing your risk of medical problems (cid:1) Keeping your weight in check (cid:1) Looking good (cid:1) Appreciating the psychological benefits of exercise (cid:1) Enjoying the social benefits of working out (cid:1) Being more productive at work (cid:1) Helping your family (cid:1) Quenching your competitive thirst (cid:1) Having fun (cid:1) Enjoying life\\n\\nspent your money on Twinkies instead of this book. But when you start a workout program, it’s always helpful to remind yourself why — why you’re hoisting hunks of steel when you could be lifting beer cans, why you’re creat- ing more laundry for yourself by sweating up your gym clothes.\\n\\nYou already know that exercise is important; otherwise, you would have\\n\\nEven if you’re already a committed exerciser, you probably have moments when your best intentions are stifled by excuses not to work out. You’re too tired or too busy, or the dog ate your dumbbells — we’ve heard ’em all (and used a few ourselves). Any time you experience one of these moments, flip to this chapter. Better yet, make a copy and tape it to your fridge. One glance at this list, and you’ll snap right out of your funk.\\n\\nExercise won’t prevent ingrown toenails or freeway congestion or the prolifer- ation of bad reality TV shows, but as we explain in this chapter, the simple act of moving your body can work wonders. Here are ten great reasons to work out.\\n\\n356 Part VIII: The Part of Tens\\n\\nYou Reduce Your Risk of Medical Problems\\n\\nPerhaps the number-one reason for working out is that you’ll be healthier. The reasons in the following list alone are enough for you to lace up your shoes and head out the door:\\n\\n(cid:2) You’re more likely to live a long life. In an eight-year study of more than 20,000 men, those who were lean but unfit had twice the risk of death as fit, lean men. Even fat men who had a history of working out (yes, it’s possible — if you eat more calories than you burn off through- out the day, you can still gain weight) had a lower death rate than those who were lean but unfit.\\n\\n(cid:2) You have more energy. People who complain that they don’t have enough energy to exercise fail to realize that working out gives you energy. In one study, middle-aged women who lifted weights for a year became 27 percent more active in daily life than before.\\n\\n(cid:2) You won’t have to count sheep. After a 12-week aerobic and strength- training regimen, research subjects reported falling asleep faster and sleeping longer than before they’d started exercising, probably because of hormonal changes. Sedentary folks who start exercising regularly boost the amount of time spent in slow-wave sleep, the phase of sleep believed to be the most restorative. They also report waking up less often during the night.\\n\\n(cid:2) You stay lithe and limber. As little as five minutes of stretching a day helps keep your muscles mobile and helps you stay agile. Reaching for your purse in the back seat, bending over to pick up a towel off the bathroom floor — being limber is important for countless everyday tasks. (cid:2) You improve your balance. In just three months, 80-year-olds who per- formed balance exercises — like walking a straight line and standing on one foot — gained the level of body control typical of people three to ten years younger. With improved balance, you have a zippier walking gait as you age, and less shuffling means fewer falls and fractures.\\n\\n(cid:2) You’re less likely to catch a cold. Moderate exercise strengthens your immune system. People who walk regularly report cold symptoms on fewer than half the days that couch potatoes report symptoms. (cid:2) You can offset the decrease in immune function that weight loss\\n\\nappears to cause. Research suggests that dieting alone causes a drop in disease-fighting cells but that a program of aerobic exercise and weight training makes up for this loss.\\n\\nChapter 24: Ten Great Reasons to Break a Sweat\\n\\n357\\n\\n(cid:2) You’re more likely to stop smoking. People who exercise vigorously\\n\\nwhile trying to kick the habit are twice as likely to stay away from ciga- rettes as wannabe ex-smokers who don’t work out. And those who exer- cise as they try to quit smoking gain only about half the weight that non-exercisers do.\\n\\n(cid:2) You increase your volume of plasma. Regular exercise increases the\\n\\nliquid component of your blood, thereby thinning your blood and reduc- ing your risk of developing dangerous clots.\\n\\n(cid:2) You lessen the symptoms of PMS. Exercise may reduce the bloating,\\n\\nlower-back pain, headaches, and anxiety that often accompany premen- strual syndrome. And regular exercisers may be less likely to experience PMS at all.\\n\\n(cid:2) You may give birth more quickly. Research suggests that fit women\\n\\nhave labors one-third shorter than women who don’t exercise, although the evidence isn’t conclusive. Fit women also have a lower risk of prema- ture labor and low-birth-weight babies, and they have less post-partum depression.\\n\\n(cid:2) You ease symptoms of menopause. Highly active menopausal women\\n\\nare significantly less likely to experience hot flashes than their sedentary counterparts. Menopausal exercisers also seem to experience a mood boost after an aerobic workout.\\n\\n(cid:2) You strengthen your bones. Both men and women start losing bone mass between ages 30 and 40. Lifting weights can not only halt the decline but in some cases can reverse it, drastically reducing your risk for osteoporosis. Weight-bearing activities like walking and running also help keep your bones strong.\\n\\n(cid:2) You build up bone density for the future. Young exercisers amass a reserve of bone mineral that may reduce their risk of developing the weak bones that plague their grandparents. A study of elite tennis play- ers found that even after the athletes cut back on their competition, the bone density they had gained earlier remained.\\n\\n(cid:2) You’re less likely to get a stress fracture. A study of military recruits\\n\\nfound that those with below-average leg strength were five times likelier to develop stress fractures (tiny bone fractures) and other overuse injuries during nine weeks of basic training.\\n\\n(cid:2) You’re less prone to carpal tunnel syndrome. If you strengthen your wrist and arm muscles, you’re less likely to develop this condition, common among people who do repetitive-motion tasks such as typing and scanning items at the grocery checkout stand.\\n\\n(cid:2) You can relieve arthritis pain. Not only can arthritis patients safely\\n\\nparticipate in exercise programs, but they often are rewarded for their efforts with pain relief and increased mobility.\\n\\n358 Part VIII: The Part of Tens\\n\\n(cid:2) You’re less likely to get injured at an impromptu game of touch football or ultimate Frisbee. By keeping your muscles strong and flexible, you can avoid that nasty hamstring pull or torn rotator cuff that sends you back to the couch with a bag of ice.\\n\\n(cid:2) You’re less likely to injure your joints. When your muscles are strong, they offer more support to your bones and joints. So, you’re less likely to twist an ankle stepping off a curb or injure your elbow by carrying a heavy briefcase.\\n\\n(cid:2) You’re likely to recover faster from an accident. If, God forbid, you get into a car wreck or other serious accident, your fitness will serve you well. Frail and weak people have lower survival rates and take longer to recover.\\n\\n(cid:2) You can ease the pain of varicose veins. The walls of varicose veins\\n\\nhave been stretched, allowing blood to pool in the legs. Exercise helps relieve the resulting swelling and aching because the contraction of calf muscles causes blood to shoot upward.\\n\\n(cid:2) You can ease lower-back pain. Strengthening your abdominal and\\n\\nlower-back muscles can do wonders to ward off lower-back pain and reduce discomfort in people who suffer this pain chronically. (cid:2) You may avoid back surgery. In one study, most of the back-pain\\n\\npatients who had been recommended for spinal surgery by a physician were able to avoid surgery by following an aggressive strengthening program. Sixteen months after completing the exercise program, only 3 of the 38 patients required surgery.\\n\\n(cid:2) You hold down your blood pressure. People who exercise regularly have about a 30 percent lower risk of developing heart-threatening hypertension than people who don’t work out. Exercise may also help lower blood pressure in people who are already hypertensive.\\n\\n(cid:2) You’re less likely to need gallbladder surgery. Confirming earlier stud- ies on men, new research suggests that women who exercise cut their risk of needing gallbladder surgery by nearly a third. Doctors have known for years that obesity increases the risk of gallstones, but now a sedentary lifestyle appears to be a factor as well.\\n\\n(cid:2) You help keep your prostate healthy. Three hours of walking per week may reduce the risk of benign prostatic hyperplasia, a condition that leads to prostate enlargement and urinary-tract problems.\\n\\n(cid:2) You’re less likely to get diabetes. Staying fit can drastically reduce your chances of developing non-insulin-dependent diabetes by lowering blood- sugar and blood-fat levels. And if you do have diabetes, exercise — with the permission of a doctor — can help control the symptoms.\\n\\n(cid:2) You’re less likely to get colon cancer. Moderate daily exercise, such as an hour-long walk or a half-hour jog, may reduce your colon cancer risk by as much as 46 percent, perhaps by affecting chemicals inside your intestines.\\n\\nChapter 24: Ten Great Reasons to Break a Sweat\\n\\n359\\n\\n(cid:2) You may reduce your risk of breast cancer. Although the evidence isn’t conclusive, research suggests that physically active women are less prone to breast cancer than women who don’t work out.\\n\\n(cid:2) You lower your risk of coronary heart disease, the number-one killer in America. People who don’t exercise are as likely to develop heart dis- ease as people who smoke. Exercise can also reduce your cholesterol count, particularly your LDL (“bad”) cholesterol, although if you’re genetically prone to high cholesterol, exercise alone may not keep your count in a healthy range.\\n\\n(cid:2) You’re less likely to have a stroke. Burning more than 1,000 calories\\n\\nper week through exercise (say, walking four hours a week) is associated with decreased stroke risk. Burning between 2,000 and 3,000 calories per week may lower your risk even more.\\n\\nThere’s a financial benefit to exercise, too. Sure, you have to invest in athletic shoes, a gym membership, and whatever gizmos you need for your favorite activity, but think of all you’ll save on doctor’s bills and prescription medica- tions by staying healthy. You even save the country money. Perhaps reducing the national debt isn’t your major priority in life, but exercising regularly can be a patriotic gesture: Obesity-related diseases cost the nation $100 billion a year.\\n\\nYou Can Control Your Weight\\n\\nSure, you can lose weight simply by dieting, but much of that weight will be muscle, not fat. Weight training prevents your muscles from wasting away as you slim down, and aerobic exercise is the most efficient way to burn calories. Check out the other weight-control benefits of exercise:\\n\\n(cid:2) You rev up your metabolism. No pill, powder, or herb can do it, but\\n\\nweight training can. For every pound of muscle you pack on, your body burns an extra 30 to 50 calories per day — not a huge figure, but perhaps enough to help prevent weight gain as you age. Make that 10 pounds of muscle, and you’re talking about an extra 300 to 500 calories per day!\\n\\n(cid:2) You can eat more without gaining weight. When you burn an extra\\n\\n2,000 calories a week on the stair-climber, you can afford to try the fresh peach cobbler or the extra helping of Thanksgiving stuffing.\\n\\n(cid:2) You’re likely to keep the weight off. Most people who lose weight gain it back within one to three years, but that’s because they don’t exercise. Among those who succeed at keeping the pounds off, more than 95 per- cent work out regularly.\\n\\n360 Part VIII: The Part of Tens\\n\\nYou Improve Your Looks\\n\\nNo amount of exercise can transform Rosie O’Donnell into Cindy Crawford, but with the right workout program, you can shape a rounder derriere, firm up your arms, and tone your legs. And that equals the following benefits:\\n\\n(cid:2) You can wow ’em at your high school reunion. Were you the nerd in high school everyone ignored? Were you the captain of the Latin club and second tuba in the marching band? Well, get on a fitness pro- gram and you’ll be the popular one at your next class gathering.\\n\\n(cid:2) You’ll look better in sleeveless shirts. Heck, with toned arms, you may even land a job on TV or in the movies — á la Jennifer Garner, Sarah Jessica Parker, and Jennifer Aniston.\\n\\n(cid:2) You’re more likely to visit a nude beach. Okay, maybe not, but research does show that exercisers report having more confidence about their bodies than sedentary people do.\\n\\nYou also look and feel younger. In one study, postmenopausal women who lifted weights twice a week for one year had the strength and bone density levels of women 15 to 20 years younger.\\n\\nYou Gain Psychological Benefits\\n\\nA truckload of research shows that you have a better sense of well-being, also known as runner’s high, following a workout. Both aerobic and weight-training sessions seem to offer this boost, as well as a number of other psychological benefits:\\n\\n(cid:2) You gain confidence that spills over to the rest of your life. The sense of accomplishment that comes from being able to run 5 miles or do 10 push-ups just may give you the confidence to make that presentation to your most important client or to ask that good-looking bank teller out on a date.\\n\\n(cid:2) You improve your memory. In a six-month study of previously sedentary men and women ages 60 to 75, those who walked three times a week scored 25 percent better on memory and judgment tasks, such as recall- ing schedules and quickly differentiating between vowels and consonants and odd and even numbers.\\n\\n(cid:2) You experience less stress. More than 150 studies prove it: Regular exer- cise makes you less tense and better able to cope with events that might otherwise transform you into Cruella de Vil or Scrooge.\\n\\nChapter 24: Ten Great Reasons to Break a Sweat\\n\\n361\\n\\n(cid:2) You can calm your mind and improve your breathing. Activities such as yoga, Pilates, and stretching provide the perfect antidote to life in the era of cell phones, beepers, faxes, call-waiting, call-forwarding, and conference calls. Learning to breathe deeply can help you control stress and anger.\\n\\n(cid:2) You gain perspective. You notice a lot more about your neighborhood when you walk, jog, or bike down the street than when you whiz by at 30 miles per hour in your car. And although you can get a swell view of New Zealand from behind the window of a bus, the thrill doesn’t com- pare to climbing a glacier or cycling past flocks of sheep.\\n\\n(cid:2) You feel happier over the long-term. Not only does a single workout make you feel better, but regular exercisers enjoy long-lasting psycho- logical benefits.\\n\\n(cid:2) You may become less depressed. Research clearly shows that exercise can help clinically depressed men and women of all ages. A review of 80 studies found that depression appears to diminish after 4 weeks of regular exercise, although the greatest improvements were found after 17 weeks.\\n\\n(cid:2) You have a healthy outlet for your anger. Instead of yelling at your boss, you can get your aggressions out during a kickboxing class — burning calories and improving your health at the same time.\\n\\nYou Enjoy Social Benefits\\n\\nGoing for a walk or a bike ride with a friend or your spouse is a good way to catch up on the latest gossip, weigh in on the day’s news, and stay current with each other’s families, friends, and pets.\\n\\nYou also boost your chances of finding a mate. Tired of the bar scene or Internet dating services? Join a running club, a kickboxing class, or a soccer team, and you’re sure to meet like-minded people. You may even meet your significant other at the gym or through a bike club.\\n\\nEven if you’re not on the hunt for a spouse, getting into a new fitness activ- ity is a great way to widen your social circle. When you hook up with a hiking club or a softball team, you meet interesting people of all ages and from all walks of life whom you may not have had the pleasure of knowing otherwise.\\n\\n362 Part VIII: The Part of Tens\\n\\nYou Improve Your On-the-Job Performance\\n\\nWhether you’re a massage therapist, a trial attorney, a trombone player, or a ball-field groundskeeper, you’ll benefit from the increased energy, concen- tration, and stamina that you get from regular exercise. Here’s why:\\n\\n(cid:2) You can better cope with shift work. Working the graveyard shift at 7-\\n\\nEleven? Swing-shift on patrol? Exercise can help temper the health prob- lems, including sleep disorders, common to people whose work shifts toy with the body’s natural rhythms.\\n\\n(cid:2) You master the art of teamwork. When you join a softball team, cycling club, or walking group, you bond with your teammates and find out what it takes to play nicely with others. These skills may come in handy at the next office conference, PTA meeting, or neighborhood-watch meeting.\\n\\nYou also have more job opportunities. You can’t be a firefighter, a police officer, or a lifeguard if you flunk the physical. And if you have your sights set on being a bouncer, big, strong muscles are pretty much a prerequisite.\\n\\nFinally, you save your company money. Employees who take advantage of corporate-wellness programs tend to have fewer doctors’ visits and fewer absences from work. Companies have saved millions by giving their employ- ees incentives to exercise.\\n\\nYour Family Benefits\\n\\nWhen you exercise, you have more options for family togetherness. Sure, you can all sit in the living room and watch slides of Aunt Marie’s 1974 vacation to Venice, but a fit family can also shoot hoops on the driveway, go hiking in the woods, or play softball. When you and your family exercise, you find all sort of benefits:\\n\\n(cid:2) You have more confidence if you’re a new father. In a study of 87 new dads, those who exercised expressed more confidence in their new role than fathers who didn’t work out. Although scientific studies haven’t yet focused on new mothers, the benefits surely work for mom, too. (cid:2) You set a good example for your kids. Want your kids to grow up\\n\\nhealthy and strong? You can be a great role model by exercising regularly. This is especially important in an era in which childhood obesity is at an all-time high.\\n\\nChapter 24: Ten Great Reasons to Break a Sweat\\n\\n363\\n\\n(cid:2) Kids are likely to perform better in school. Compared to sedentary\\n\\ngirls, active girls have better grades, a lower drop-out rate, and a greater likelihood of attending college.\\n\\n(cid:2) Kids can succeed in science. Marie Curie may not have run any\\n\\nmarathons or spiked any volleyballs, but research shows that high school girls who play sports are more likely to get good grades in sci- ence classes than their nonathletic peers.\\n\\n(cid:2) Kids discover abilities they never knew you had. Maybe your child has the tennis talent of the Williams sisters, but it has been hidden all these years. Maybe your child’s body is built for power-lifting but she just never realized it. Chances are, your kids have a real knack for some type of athletic endeavor — whether it’s running, softball, or aerobic dance — but they won’t know until they try.\\n\\n(cid:2) Kids can become more resilient during childhood. Research shows\\n\\nthat kids who participate in sports are more likely to bounce back from disappointment and adversity than children who aren’t active. Fit kids are also less likely to feel stressed out.\\n\\n(cid:2) Kids are less likely to start smoking. Boys and girls ages 12 to 16 who\\n\\nspend much of their leisure time doing physical activity are significantly less likely to start smoking than low-activity groups.\\n\\n(cid:2) Kids are less likely to get pregnant as teenagers. Teenage female ath- letes are less likely to get pregnant than girls who don’t participate in sports. They’re also more likely to have their first sexual experience later in adolescence than nonathletes.\\n\\n(cid:2) You can keep up with your grandkids. Wouldn’t it be nice to toss\\n\\naround the pigskin with your granddaughter without your arm getting sore and tired? Regular workouts can give you the strength and stamina to be a worthy opponent for family tennis tournaments and basketball on the driveway.\\n\\nYour pet can get fit, too. Take your pooch for longer and more frequent walks, and he’ll live a longer, healthier life. Plus, dogs thrive on activity. They much prefer to trot around and take in the sights than impersonate a throw rug that happens to be alive.\\n\\nYou Satisfy Your Competitive Urges\\n\\nParticipating in a local 5K road race or vying for a trophy in the company golf championship is a healthy outlet for your competitive spirit. Even racing against the clock can be a satisfying pursuit. Plus, you perform better in all\\n\\n364 Part VIII: The Part of Tens\\n\\nsports. A dead-on jump shot or wicked tennis serve carries you only so far. Regular exercise gives you the stamina and agility to outlast your opponents on the court or on the field.\\n\\nAt the same time, you can help find a cure for leukemia, multiple sclerosis, or breast cancer. Nationwide, hundreds of athletic events raise money for impor- tant medical research. You can run, walk, bike, swim, even snowshoe — all in the name of having fun and saving lives.\\n\\nAnd don’t forget that, when you compete, you get cool stuff. Run a 10K or ride in a bike-a-thon, and you score all sorts of unique t-shirts, caps, water bottles, sweat bands, and socks that you won’t find at Gap or Target. These items lend you an air of mystique and athleticism, plus they’re pretty useful. Not bad for a $15 or $20 entry fee.\\n\\nYou Have Fun\\n\\nWhen you discover an activity you love, whether it’s step aerobics or indoor rock-climbing, you stop thinking of exercise as drudgery and look forward to lacing up your athletic shoes. Exercise is like recess was in grade school — a time to stop being serious and just get out there and play.\\n\\nYou also have infinitely more travel options. Instead of taking yet another cruise or bus tour or parking yourself at the craps tables in Vegas, you can bicycle in Vermont, kayak in Alaska, or hike the Grand Canyon. And back on the home front, instead of sequestering yourself indoors for four months this winter and piling on the sweaters to hide extra poundage, you can snowshoe, ski, snowboard, skate — invigorating activities that can prevent winter weight gain and give you an edge for snowball fights with the neighborhood kids.\\n\\nYou Enjoy Life More\\n\\nSure, this is kind of a catch-all category, but the bottom line is that life is more fun when you’re fit. Check out these additional benefits to working out:\\n\\n(cid:2) You’re more creative. In one study, subjects who did aerobic exercise\\n\\nscored higher on creative thinking tests than did subjects who watched a video. That’s not surprising: Many people come up with their best ideas while on the run.\\n\\n(cid:2) You can catch up on your reading. Does your living room resemble a newspaper recycling facility? Are you burdened with guilt for not even opening the 14 magazines you subscribe to? Kill two birds with one stone by reading on the stationary bike or the stair-climber.\\n\\nChapter 24: Ten Great Reasons to Break a Sweat\\n\\n365\\n\\n(cid:2) You sharpen your math skills. When you load weight plates onto a bar- bell, you have to do some fast calculations. (Quick: How much weight is a 45-pound bar plus two 10-pound plates and two 5-pound plates?) The math gets even more challenging when you convert miles per hour on the treadmill to how many minutes per mile you’re running.\\n\\n(cid:2) You’re more useful around the house. You don’t need help unscrewing\\n\\nthat stubborn jar of pickles, hoisting that 10-gallon jug of water, or pulling apart the sofa bed for your houseguests.\\n\\n(cid:2) You’re more productive. Can’t garden for more than 20 minutes without stopping to rest your achy knees? Can’t get all your errands done in one shot because you need to take a break? Do you avoid visiting your friend who lives in that fourth-floor walk-up? When you’re fit, none of this is a worry.\\n\\n(cid:2) You’re likely to watch less junk TV. When exercise is part of your life, you don’t have time to sit around with the remote, bouncing around from Survivor to CSI to Desperate Housewives.\\n\\n(cid:2) You have an excuse to go shopping. You can buy an endless number of nifty gadgets without feeling guilty, such as a heart-rate monitor, a set of dumbbells, a titanium bike seat, or a windproof ski vest.\\n\\n(cid:2) You enjoy retirement more. Not that we don’t love Scrabble and gin\\n\\nrummy, but fit seniors have more activity choices, from golf to gardening to world travel.\\n\\n(cid:2) You discover a lot about your body. When you lift weights, you become intimately acquainted with your muscles and their individual job descrip- tions. You notice that your back muscles are called for duty when you pull a bar toward you, and you realize that your chest muscles kick in when you push a bar away from you.\\n\\n(cid:2) You get to learn a whole new language. Reps, sets, pecs, lats, target\\n\\nzone — when you hang out at health clubs or build a library of exercise videos, you quickly become fluent in the language of exercise. Your friends will be impressed!\\n\\n(cid:2) You develop a greater appreciation for the athletes you watch on TV or cheer for at sporting events. You don’t understand just how tough it is to hit a 90-mph fastball, duck a lightning-fast left hook, or cycle 100 miles uphill until you try these sports yourself. After you start working out, you’ll watch events like the Tour de France and the New York City marathon with a whole new outlook.\\n\\n366 Part VIII: The Part of Tens\\n\\nChapter 25 Ten Great Fitness Investments under $100\\n\\nIn This Chapter (cid:1) Reviewing the best fitness bargains (cid:1) Picking up valuable accessories (cid:1) Rewarding yourself for your hard work\\n\\nYou can spend thousands of dollars on high-tech exercise machinery, but\\n\\nsome of the most valuable fitness products around cost less than $100.\\n\\nIn this chapter, we recommend simple products and services that can turn pain into pleasure and drudgery into fun. These ten cheap fitness invest- ments are sure to pay you back many times over. We list them roughly in order from cheapest to most expensive.\\n\\nA Water Bottle\\n\\nYou’re a heckuva lot more likely to down your eight to ten glasses a day if you carry around a water bottle — at the gym, at the office, or in front of the TV. If you have to hop off the treadmill and traipse halfway across the room to the water fountain, you won’t. Honestly, you have no excuse not to own a water bottle. They’re often offered as freebies when you join a gym or buy a bike, and even if you have to break down and pay for one, you’re still only out $5.\\n\\nAlthough water bottles are the ultimate indoor exercise accessory, there’s an even better product for outdoor workouts: a hydration pack. It’s an insulated pouch that you wear like a lightweight backpack when you’re cycling, walk- ing, hiking, skiing, or snowshoeing. You fill the pouch with water; to drink, you bite down on the end of a flexible tube that hangs over your shoulder. Camelbak, the inventor of the hydration pack, even makes a nifty winter version that has an insulated tube that won’t freeze. Research suggests that\\n\\n368 Part VIII: The Part of Tens\\n\\nhydration-pack users drink more fluids — and drink more frequently — than water-bottle users. This makes sense because biting down on a tube is much more convenient than reaching down to grab your water bottle. Hydration packs cost $40 to $100. Many come with extra zipper pockets to store food, money, extra bike tubes, and so on.\\n\\nA Good Pair of Socks\\n\\nYou probably put quite a bit of thought into purchasing your athletic shoes, shorts, jackets, skates, skis, and helmets. But socks? Nah. Chances are, you grabbed a six-pack at the discount store without considering anything but the price.\\n\\nIt may seem ridiculous, but there are socks designed for almost every sport, and usually they’re worth the extra money. Socks act as a buffer between your foot and your shoe, so they help prevent blisters, calluses, and other shoe- friction problems. For each sport, you use your feet differently and wear dif- ferent shoes, so it only makes sense to wear different socks. There’s even a difference between running socks (extra padding across the toes and bridge of the foot) and walking socks (more padding in the heel).\\n\\nSuzanne used to cycle in the same cotton socks she’d wear to the movies. It wasn’t until she scored a pair of freebie biking socks at a fundraiser that she realized the difference: Socks designed for cycling wick away sweat and let her feet breathe. And when it rains, her feet don’t freeze. She now gladly pays $7 for Air-eators, her favorite brand.\\n\\nExperiment with different types of socks, and before you invest in a whole new wardrobe of socks, buy a single pair to test. In general, we prefer light- weight synthetic sock materials such as CoolMax because they breathe better and dry faster than cotton or wool socks. We also like SmartWool socks ($7–$15), which are made from high-quality wool and specially treated so they dry quickly and hold their shape well. Two other sports sock brands that we like are Wigwam and Thorlo.\\n\\nStretching Mat\\n\\nSure, you could stretch on a rolled-up towel or plush carpet, but how often do you actually do it? A mat not only makes stretching more comfortable but also reminds you to do your flexibility exercises. For about $7, you can get a perfectly functional stretching mat made of flexible plastic. (The $7 ones are too stiff to roll up, but they fit pretty neatly in a closet or under a bed.) If you’re willing to pay $30 or more, you can get a mat that folds up and has a cloth covering.\\n\\nChapter 25: Ten Great Fitness Investments under $100\\n\\n369\\n\\nIf you do a lot of yoga (see Chapter 16) or meditation, try a “sticky” mat, which costs from $15 to $40. These mats are made of soft, thin plastic coated with a sticky film that helps keep you steady during moves that require bal- ance. Brands we like include Frelonic and Airex.\\n\\nWeightlifting Gloves\\n\\nLifting weights (see Chapter 11) does countless good things to your body — shaping your muscles, boosting your strength, and thickening your bones, to name a few — but pumping iron isn’t kind to one particular area: your palms. After a few months of gripping dumbbells and weight machines, the skin on your hands starts to feel like sandpaper. You can prevent major callus buildup by wearing weightlifting gloves, sold at most sporting goods stores for $15 to $20.\\n\\nGloves not only protect your palms but also give you a better grip on the weights. Suzanne is convinced that she can do more pull-ups while wearing weightlifting gloves than while gripping a slippery bar with naked hands. She’s so enamored of her gloves that she keeps them in her backpack when she travels so that she’s all set to work out if she unexpectedly walks past a gym. Suzanne likes gloves with Velcro wrist adjustments so that she can tighten and loosen the gloves as needed.\\n\\nA Workout Log\\n\\nYou may think tracking your workouts in an exercise diary is obsessive; who needs extra paperwork? But a workout log offers proof of your commitment to exercise. Nothing is more motivating than seeing your accomplishments on paper.\\n\\nJot down as many details as you can think of without making yourself feel like a court reporter at a deposition. (Chapter 3 lists the particulars worth noting.) A workout diary need not be a fancy affair — a notebook from the drugstore will suffice. Personally, we’re partial to store-bought logs designed especially for the purpose of tracking daily workouts. They lend a sense of importance to what you’re doing, and many are filled with good training tips and inspira- tional quotes.\\n\\nYou can purchase workout diaries for less than $20 at bookstores, sporting goods stores, and the Internet. Some logs are designed for specific activities — like walking, cycling, and weight lifting. You also can buy all-purpose logs that provide space to track weight-training exercises, cardiovascular workouts, stretching, and nutrition notes.\\n\\n370 Part VIII: The Part of Tens\\n\\nPlateMates\\n\\nWhen you start a weight-training program, increasing your weights by the smallest increment possible is important. PlateMates, shown in Figure 25-1, can help fill in the gaps. These ingenious weight magnets adhere to each end of a dumbbell and save you the cost of buying extra weights. They come in four weights: 5⁄8 pound, 11⁄4 pound, 17⁄8 pound, and 21⁄2 pounds. Prices range from about $19 to $28 per pair. Stick a pair of 11⁄4-pound PlateMates on the end of your 5-pound dumbbells and voila — you have 71⁄2-pounders. Now stick ’em to your 10-pounders, and you have 121⁄2-pounders. You can buy a handy carrying case for the weights (about $9) so that you can take them to your health club as well.\\n\\nFigure 25-1: PlateMates can save you big.\\n\\nPhotograph by Sunstreak Productions, Inc\\n\\nA Gym Bag\\n\\nYou’d never consider boarding an airplane carrying your shirts, pants, shoes, toothpaste, hairbrush, and shampoo all in your hands. Yet many people arrive at the gym juggling all sorts of paraphernalia, including car keys, membership card, tape player, towel, water bottle, and magazines. Perhaps this is because they don’t realize how sophisticated gym bags have become. The best ones have pockets for everything — small compartments for a wallet or member- ship card, medium-sized zipper sections ideal for a radio/CD player or work- out gloves, and mesh pouches for your stinky clothes so that mold doesn’t start to grow. Many bags have special features for different sports. In-line\\n\\nChapter 25: Ten Great Fitness Investments under $100\\n\\n371\\n\\nskating bags have special pockets to hold your skates. Soccer bags have com- partments to separate your muddy, grassy cleats from the rest of your items. Swimming bags are designed to accommodate your fins, paddles, and goggles; good ones have a waterproof compartment to throw your suit in when it’s wet.\\n\\nYou can get a good bag for less than $50. Look for sturdy, easy-to-wash fabrics such as thick nylon. Canvas tends to rip and soil easily. A gym bag should have a rigid bottom so that when you place it on the floor, it stands upright. This helps keep your items in place. We also like bags with both shoulder straps and handles so that you can choose how to carry your bag. If you tend to walk home from the gym at night — or even just from the club to the parking lot — look for a bag with reflective stripes or glow-in-the-dark panels.\\n\\nA Heart-Rate Monitor\\n\\nHeart-rate monitors are the training tool of choice for both serious and recre- ational exercisers. Because your heart rate is directly proportional to how hard you’re working, a monitor is a great way to determine your exercise intensity. We especially recommend these gizmos for beginners who are just learning how to push themselves, and for people training for a competition who want to get a sense of what it feels like to work out at near-maximum pace. (See Chapter 8 for details on how to put your monitor to good use.) A monitor is also especially valuable if you’re a home exerciser. You don’t have the roar of the crowd to keep you going, or the wide assortment of equipment to occupy you; your heart rate gives you something tangible to focus on. Prices range from $59 for a simple model to $400 for one that lets you down- load information to your computer, create graphs of your training intensities, and cross-reference this information with every variable from the weather to the type of shoes you wear.\\n\\nA Personal Training Appointment\\n\\nHiring a personal trainer sounds like hiring a personal chef — an extrava- gance that’s swell for Oprah but unrealistic for the rest of us. But we’re not talking about a lifetime commitment here. You can hire a trainer for a couple of sessions, either at home or at a health club, to get you started on a pro- gram tailored to your goals and your fitness level or to update your current routine. Trainers cost between $25 and $100 per session. If you buddy up with a friend or two, your sessions may cost less.\\n\\n372 Part VIII: The Part of Tens\\n\\nIf you plan to be a short-timer, inform your trainer of your intentions so that he can cover more in a shorter period of time. And think specifically about your goals for these few sessions. Do you want to learn a routine you can take on business trips? Do you want training advice for a summer cycling vacation? Do you want a program to help you lose fat? Act like you’re taking a crash course in Italian two weeks before you move to Rome: Be prepared to soak up a lot of information. Arm yourself with questions and take notes. By the end of your session(s), make sure you know how to adjust each machine, grip each handle the right way, and perform each exercise using the correct technique. And consider scheduling follow-up sessions once a month or so to check your progress, stay up-to-date, and continue to improve your skills. Also find out whether your trainer is willing to answer quick questions via e-mail as part of the overall cost.\\n\\nA Massage\\n\\nOkay, you’ve been exercising for a solid month. You deserve a reward, and besides, your legs feel a little sore. What better way to treat yourself than with a rubdown?\\n\\nMassage loosens up kinks in your muscles, relieves stress, and helps you relax. Research suggests it may even speed your body’s recovery from a workout or injury by increasing blood flow and, therefore, delivering more oxygen and nutrients to your muscle cells and restoring muscle and joint mobility. Massage may also make you more mentally alert. In one study, subjects who had been massaged were able to do math problems in half the time, and with half as many errors, as subjects who weren’t touched.\\n\\nAlthough we’re not all that motivated to improve our algebra skills, we like massage for a more important reason: It feels soooo good. Depending on where you live, an hour-long massage can run you between $35 and $100. Sessions in your home usually cost a little more, to compensate for the driving time and the fact that the therapist has to lug a big, heavy table to your door.\\n\\nIn most states, massage therapists are required to pass a certification exam. Chances are, any therapist who works at a club or spa is fully licensed and certified, but it never hurts to ask. For a home massage, get a recommenda- tion from a doctor, trainer, or friend you trust. You may think “bad massage” is an oxymoron, but you can get rubbed the wrong way. A rock-climber friend of Liz’s had his arms massaged by someone who practically mauled him. The guy was so bruised and in pain that he couldn’t climb for two weeks.\\n\\nChapter 26 Ten Fitness Rip-Offs\\n\\nIn This Chapter (cid:1) Ten products that are a waste of your money (cid:1) Ten tips for buying fitness products advertised on TV\\n\\nAt a fitness-equipment trade show not long ago, we mentioned to an\\n\\nflimsy and useless. “I wouldn’t disagree with you,” the executive said, smiling. “But we’ve sold 20,000 units in the first month.”\\n\\ninfomercial executive that a certain abdominal gadget appeared to be\\n\\nYou oughta be insulted. The fitness industry has no shortage of hucksters, and they count on the public’s naiveté — and hunger for a quick fix — to keep the money rolling in. They sell exercise gizmos that, off the record, they admit are useless. They use scientific mumbo jumbo to promote products based on nothing more than wishful thinking. They pay celebrities big bucks to go on TV and lie.\\n\\nThe Federal Trade Commission, the government agency that monitors truth in advertising, is aware of these scams and has boosted efforts to nail compa- nies making fraudulent health and fitness claims. However, the advertising police are not unlike big-city cops: They only have the manpower to hunt down the most egregious offenders. And with the rise of the Internet, fitness crooks have proliferated.\\n\\nAll of this means that you need to be a very savvy fitness consumer. In this chapter, we give you the lowdown on ten products that we consider to be a waste of money. We also offer tips on judging other fitness products that you may come across on TV infomercials, on the Internet, in magazine advertise- ments, and in fitness-equipment and health-food stores. Our advice, in a word: Beware!\\n\\n374 Part VIII: The Part of Tens\\n\\nAnti-Cellulite Products\\n\\nThe products: Creams and gels intended to eliminate cellulite, the puckery fat that forms on the butt, hips, and thighs of most women and some men. What are the magic ingredients? Cellasene pills contain, among other things, gingko biloba, sweet clover, grapeseed bioflavonoids, and dried fucus vesiculosus (a kelp-like seaweed found off the Atlantic coasts of Europe). Lipofactor cream is made of “biotechnologically derived elements a/y.” We have absolutely no idea what this means, but this phrase is repeated all over the Internet.\\n\\nThe reality: Talk about scientific mumbo jumbo! No legitimate research exists to show that any pill or cream can reduce cellulite. Physiologically speaking, cellulite doesn’t even exist. The term is marketing hype for plain old fat that clumps at various points on your body. The ripple effect is caused by a net- work of connective tissue fibers that attach muscle to skin and compartmen- talize the fat like stitching on a quilt. You reduce cellulite the same way you reduce any fat: through a healthy diet and regular exercise. However, you may never lose the ripples. For some people, they’re a genetic fact of life.\\n\\nMetabolism Boosters\\n\\nThe products: Pills and powders intended to speed up your metabolism so that your body burns more calories during the course of the day without requiring you to increase activity. Several of these supplements — such as Ultra Burn, CitraLean, and Hydroxycut — contain HCA (hydroxycitric acid), a form of citric acid found in fruits. Others contain chromium picolinate, a form of the mineral chromium, or ephedra (also called ma huang), an herbal stimu- lant. Some combine almost every ingredient known to mankind.\\n\\nThe reality: Solid research shows that chromium picolinate has little nutri- tional value. Only two legitimate, published studies have even tested HCA in humans, and the results were contradictory. (Animal studies have shown the substance to be toxic, causing rat testicles to atrophy.) As for ephedra, the FDA has fielded more than 800 reports of medical problems from this stimulant, including heart attacks, strokes, seizures, and a nasty side-effect known as death. Ephedrine can be especially lethal for those with high blood pressure. It is banned in California.\\n\\nAmphetamines and over-the-counter stimulants can indeed rev up your metab- olism, but even if you can withstand the side-effects (such as increased blood pressure and heart rate), your body tends to adapt to these substances, so the effect is likely to be short-lived. The only safe and lasting way to boost your metabolic rate is to increase your muscle mass by lifting weights (and even that, as we explain in Chapter 11, isn’t going to have a magical effect).\\n\\nChapter 26: Ten Fitness Rip-Offs\\n\\n375\\n\\nFat Blockers\\n\\nThe products: Pills intended to prevent your body from absorbing the fat you eat. Chitosan — a substance that forms the hard shells of shellfish and insects — is a popular ingredient. Another is pyruvate, a substance that occurs naturally in the body and is involved in energy production.\\n\\nThe reality: Sure, it would be nice if you could enjoy fried chicken, mounds of mashed potatoes and gravy, butter, rolls, ice cream, and cake — all without gaining weight. But guess what? You can’t! We don’t know whether pyruvate and chitosan are beneficial for weight loss. We do know that both Fat Trapper and Exercise in a Bottle can run you as much as $300 a month — a whopping $3,600 a year. That’s ten times the cost of many gym memberships. If you’re serious about dropping body fat, stay away from high-fat foods and get plenty of the type of exercise that doesn’t come in a bottle.\\n\\nEffortless Exercisers\\n\\nThe products: These contraptions are the player pianos of exercise machines. They move whether you’re holding on or not. Consider the Stretch-A-Cizer, essentially a chair with a handlebar mounted above the seat back. “All you do is sit on the seat and hold onto the exercise bar while it goes through the motions,” explains an Internet ad for this $1,200 electric contraption (freight prepaid!). Also in this category: the Chi Machine Aerobic Exerciser. You lie on your back on the floor, place your ankles on the machine’s contoured footrest, flip a switch, and let this $460 gizmo toss you around like a fish out of water. “This is not a 10-kilometer run kind of workout, where one gets all sweaty and exhausted,” the Chi Machine Web site reports. “Instead you lie down, relax, [and] have a ‘workout.’”\\n\\nThe reality: This is all a bunch of baloney. We don’t think we have to tell you why you won’t get thin by lying on the floor and having electrical impulses shoot up your spine so you flop around like a fish — even if you do this five times a day for 15 minutes, as the Chi Machine literature recommends.\\n\\nElectronic Muscle Stimulation Machines\\n\\nThe products: Metal boxes that deliver a low-impulse jolt of electricity to muscles that are covered by electrodes. This jolt is supposed to tone and tighten muscles.\\n\\n376 Part VIII: The Part of Tens\\n\\nThe reality: The only way to strengthen your muscles is to work out. We think the reason electrical stimulation gizmos have such staying power is that electrical stimulus or transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulation (TENS) machines do have legitimate medical uses: They’re used by highly trained doctors and physical therapists to manage pain and help rehabilitate certain injuries. But they can cause serious injury from burns and electrical shocks when used by laypeople.\\n\\nSpot-Reducing Gadgets\\n\\nThe products: Abdominal gizmos, neoprene “waist trimmer” belts, neck toners, “reducing” shorts — there’s no shortage of products that profess to melt the fat on a particularly blubbery spot on your body. In response to a crackdown by the Federal Trade Commission, many abdominal-gadget manu- facturers have stopped making the direct claim that their products will cause weight loss in the abdominal area. However, they haven’t stopped implying that this will happen, firming and flattening abs, melting excess fat, and so on.\\n\\nThe reality: The concept of spot-reducing is bogus; you can’t pick and choose where on your body you’ll lose fat. Abdominal exercises can only strengthen your abdominals (and many of them don’t even do a good job of that). To lose that gut, you have to embark on a sensible eating and exercise program — an approach that will reduce your overall body fat. Some of this body fat is likely to come from your midsection.\\n\\nWeight-Loss Clothing\\n\\nThe products: Vinyl and synthetic rubber exercise suits that make you sweat like it’s August in New Orleans.\\n\\nThe reality: It doesn’t matter whose heat you use: Reducing inches by sweating profusely can put you in serious danger. People have died from wearing vinyl and rubber suits after working out in the heat or wearing the clothing over a long period of time. Cause of death: extreme dehydration or a form of blood poisoning brought on when chemicals from the suit escape into the bloodstream. We think suggesting that these suits can be worn for “the most strenuous activities” is particularly appalling. The more strenuous the activity, the more important it is to wear clothing that lets your skin breathe.\\n\\nChapter 26: Ten Fitness Rip-Offs\\n\\n377\\n\\nFour-Minute Workouts\\n\\nThe product: ROM, a popular infomercial machine that looks like a combina- tion stepper and indoor bicycle. The idea is that the machine offers such a phenomenal cardio and flexibility workout that you can get into the shape of your life in just four minutes per day.\\n\\nThe reality: No four-minute cardiovascular workout will give you significant strength-training or weight-loss benefits. Certainly this contraption is no substitute for ten gym machines. And it doesn’t burn nearly three times the calories of a treadmill. (Machines don’t burn calories; people do. The number of calories you burn per minute depends on how hard you push. Some machines do allow you to work at a more intense pace than others, but the Romfab claim is totally unfounded.)\\n\\nGym Cardio Machine Knockoffs\\n\\nThe products: Cheapo treadmills, stair-climbers, and elliptical trainers that profess to work and feel exactly the same as the cardio equipment found in health clubs. You can find these at sporting-goods stores, online, and in mail- order catalogs.\\n\\nThe reality: You simply can’t buy sturdy, high-tech aerobic machinery for the price of dinner at a fancy restaurant. Top-quality machines cost thousands of dollars for a reason: They’re based on years of scientific research and the study of body biomechanics. The angle of movement, the placement of the seat, how far your legs can move — all these important features are based on solid engineering. That’s usually not the case with cardio knockoffs. After a while, you may find that your back hurts or your knees ache because of poor design.\\n\\nWhat’s more, these contraptions aren’t as sturdy as the gym versions. When you step on the treadmill at the gym, you don’t feel the walking belt sink or the handrails wobble. Suzanne almost toppled over while testing one of these at a trade show. And several people have filed lawsuits after allegedly hurting themselves on cheapo machines while trying them out in the store.\\n\\nOne more caveat: Cheap cardio machines usually don’t come with good warranties — usually 90 days or less — compared to 1 to 3 years for high- end machines. See Chapter 20 for tips on buying high-quality cardio machines for your home.\\n\\n378 Part VIII: The Part of Tens\\n\\nHand Weights\\n\\nThe products: Dumbbells that weigh 1 to 5 pounds and are designed to be held while running, jogging, power walking, and doing step aerobics. Many of these products claim to combine strength training with aerobic conditioning in one workout, while causing you to burn extra calories.\\n\\nThe reality: People who power walk with weights in their hands look quite serious and impressive, but the truth is, these weights aren’t doing them any good. Research on walkers shows that carrying hand weights burns only 10 to 15 percent more calories — a mere 20 to 30 calories over the course of an hour, at least half of which come from exaggerating your arm swing, not from the weights. (To put this in perspective: Speeding up from a 3-mph pace to a 4-mph pace burns an extra 54 calories.)\\n\\nResearch on aerobic dancers suggests that you may actually burn fewer calories holding hand weights than holding nothing at all. That’s because weight-holding exercisers must keep both arm and leg movements tight and controlled. In other words, you don’t move your body as much or as far because if you flail the weights around, you get thrown off balance. As a result, you burn fewer calories.\\n\\nAlso, swinging hand weights vigorously can place undue stress on delicate upper-body joints such as the shoulder, elbow, and wrist. Due to a concept called torque, there are points in your arm swing when a weight exerts up to ten times the usual force on your joints. In other words, a measly 3-pound weight will place up to 30 pounds of force on those delicate joints. Plus, this force is delivered in a jerky manner, which can do a lot of damage.\\n\\nFinally, realize that you’re not going to build strength with these weights. Any dumbbell that’s light enough for you to carry around while walking is too light to strengthen your muscles. As we explain in Chapter 13, to build strength you need to lift weights that are heavy enough that you can perform no more than about 15 repetitions of an exercise.\\n\\nChapter 27 Ten Ways to Stay Motivated\\n\\nIn This Chapter (cid:1) Committing to an event to jump-start your fitness program (cid:1) Finding inspiration in others (cid:1) Spicing up your workouts\\n\\nFor some people, the motivation to work out comes naturally. These\\n\\ntasting or watching NASCAR or following the stock market.\\n\\npeople have the same passion for exercise that others have for wine\\n\\nBut for most people, the inspiration to work out comes and goes. And the truth is, even the most dedicated fitness buffs go through periods when they just don’t feel like lacing up their cross-trainers and heading to the gym.\\n\\nSo what separates those who can pull themselves out of the exercise doldrums from those who succumb to feelings of inertia? There’s no single strategy. Instead, successful exercisers tend to rely on a whole repertoire of tactics. Here are ten of the best ways to keep yourself motivated. Try all these strategies. At least one is bound to work for you.\\n\\nTrain for an Event\\n\\nSuzanne once interviewed an Olympic weightlifter who described himself as a “pretty lazy guy.” “If I wasn’t training for the Olympics,” he said, “I probably wouldn’t even work out.”\\n\\nEven if you don’t aspire to hoist 424 pounds overhead before thousands of screaming fans, committing to an event can jump-start your workout program. The options are countless — a 5K walk, a 10K run, a mini-triathlon, a 100-mile bike ride. The minute you mail in your entry fee, you have a whole new sense of purpose. And the feeling of accomplishment you get from completing your event is like nothing else.\\n\\n380 Part VIII: The Part of Tens\\n\\nIf you’re a novice, an excellent option is to join a training program organized by a charity. You’ll have the double motivation of getting in shape and know- ing that you’re raising money for a good cause. Here are two of the best national programs:\\n\\n(cid:2) The Leukemia Society’s Team in Training (www.teamintraining.org):\\n\\nThis program prepares even complete beginners to run or walk a marathon or bicycle a century (100 miles). Each week you and your team- mates meet with an experienced coach. You’re also paired with a local “Honored Patient” who cheers you on throughout your training. On the day of the event, you wear a special wristband with the patient’s name.\\n\\n(cid:2) AIDS LifeCycle (www.aidslifecycle.org): You get all the flat-tire\\n\\nseminars, training tips, and camaraderie you need to complete one of nine annual AIDS Rides, three- to seven-day cycling tours that cover 50 to 80 miles per day. Many participants don’t even own bikes when they sign up.\\n\\n“Every week on the training rides you see people of all different shapes, sizes, and ages training for the same cause,” says our friend Tracy, who has completed the San Francisco–to–Los Angeles AIDS Ride four times. “That gives you the psychological momentum to keep going.” Finishing the ride along with 2,000 other cyclists in matching shirts is exhilarating, Tracy says. “People are honking their horns and lining the streets for miles with posters, balloons, and banners. You feel like a celebrity.”\\n\\nKeep Your Goals in Plain Sight\\n\\nThe “lazy” Olympic weightlifter mentioned in the preceding section keeps a picture of the Olympic rings next to his bed. Some people tape their goals to the bathroom mirror or refrigerator. Suzanne knows a swimmer who writes his goals on his kickboard. Liz has a client who enters her workout goals into her computer’s screen saver so that she sees them scrolling by every time she takes a break from typing.\\n\\nWhether you write your goals on the side of your shoe or in your training diary, glancing at them on a daily basis helps keep you focused and motivated. What if you don’t have specific goals to write down? Turn to Chapter 3 ASAP.\\n\\nWork Out with a Club or a Team\\n\\nBack when Suzanne rode her bike alone, she’d roll along at a leisurely pace, get bored after about 20 miles, and head home before she was even tired. Some days she was so uninspired that she’d keep pushing the snooze button on her alarm until it was too late to work out. But these days when the buzzer\\n\\nChapter 27: Ten Ways to Stay Motivated\\n\\n381\\n\\nsounds, she flies out of bed, blends up a fruit smoothie, and heads out for a ride. The difference? She hooked up with an informal group of 15 cyclists who meet on a street corner three days a week in suburban Los Angeles. Now her rides are so much fun that Suzanne doesn’t even mind sitting in traffic for 50 minutes to get to the starting point. Plus, by riding with a group of cyclists who are much faster than she is, Suzanne has become a much stronger biker.\\n\\nWhether you join a bike club, a hiking group, a swim team, or a soccer league, you’re sure to gain inspiration from your workout buddies. Don’t worry if you’re the slowest one in the group; just do as much as you can handle. Eventually, you’ll catch up with the rest. Don’t sweat it, either, if the group isn’t friendly right off the bat. Some groups can be cliquish, and it takes time to break in. If you keep showing up, eventually you’ll be one of the gang. If you don’t have a group of friends who are interested in working out, check with your local running or cycling store or search the Internet for the name of your town and terms like workout group.\\n\\nWork Out with a Buddy\\n\\nIf you can’t find a local club that fits your schedule, set up a workout schedule with a friend. When Liz’s friends Patty and Ann trained for a triathlon together, they met at 4 a.m. every morning for a bike ride, followed by weight lifting and yoga. On the weekends they did their runs and swims together. This went on for six months until they completed the event successfully. Both say they couldn’t have done it without the other’s support and companionship. “The only way I could get my butt out of bed at 4 in the morning was knowing Ann would be there, too,” says Patty.\\n\\nJoin an Internet Fitness Community\\n\\nNot everyone can find workout partners in his neighborhood. But thanks to the Internet, you can gain inspiration from fitness buddies across the country — or even the world. Several fitness Web sites have forums where visitors can chat with like-minded exercisers and develop strong bonds with one another.\\n\\nSome sites even help you find an e-mail pen pal with similar interests and fitness goals. For instance, at the Fitness Jumpsite (www.primusweb.com/ fitnesspartner), you can post an ad describing your exercise pursuits and what you’re looking for in an e-mail fitness buddy. Postings run the gamut — from a single mom in Australia wanting to lose 50 pounds to a North Carolina college student needing inspiration to lift weights instead of hanging out all night in his dorm downing pizza and beer.\\n\\n382 Part VIII: The Part of Tens\\n\\nInternet groups are especially helpful for home exercisers. “People who exer- cise at home don’t have the social benefit that you can get at a health club, and in many cases, they don’t have any friends or family who exercise,” says Wendy Niemi Kremer, founder of Video Fitness (www.videofitness.com), a Web site for exercise video enthusiasts. (See Chapter 19 for more details about the site.) “Video Fitness has become an enormous support group. When any crisis in your life can derail your exercise program, it’s nice to have some- where to go.”\\n\\nTest Your Fitness Regularly\\n\\nSure, exercise gives you intangible benefits like more energy and greater self- esteem. But it also helps to translate your progress into raw numbers: how many pounds you can bench-press, how many beats your resting heart rate has dropped, how fast you can run a mile, how much body fat you’ve lost. (We explain all these tests in Chapter 2.) Track these numbers in a workout log or notebook (see Chapter 3) so that you can keep track of your progress over time.\\n\\nFor your first year that you work out regularly, you may want to get tested every three months. (You make the most noticeable improvements when you first start exercising; then progress becomes less dramatic.) After the first year, we suggest getting tested every six months. If you don’t want to spend the time or money on a whole battery of tests, ask a certified trainer to do the part you find most motivating, such as a body-fat test or blood-pressure read- ing. A heart-rate monitor can be useful for the do-it-yourself tests that we describe in Chapters 2 and 8.\\n\\nIf you’re training for a specific event, you may want to do a time trial once a month. For example, if your goal is to walk a mile in a certain amount of time, break out your stopwatch once a month and go all out. If you train properly, each time you test yourself you’ll move a bit closer to your goal.\\n\\nMix Up Your Workouts\\n\\nSome people thrive on routine. Suzanne bicycles with a 67-year-old retired racer named Barry who has been riding the exact same route on Saturdays for 41 years. Much to the frustration of his wife, Barry refuses to take non- cycling vacations, because he doesn’t want to miss his daily ride.\\n\\nMost of us, however, need a bit of variety to stay motivated. For this reason, you may want to try cross-training, which simply means mixing up your activi- ties. Cross-training means different things to different people. You can vary\\n\\nChapter 27: Ten Ways to Stay Motivated\\n\\n383\\n\\nyour sport — running on Mondays, swimming on Tuesdays, hiking on Wednes- days, and so on. Or you can vary your pace and terrain — walking fast and flat one day, slow and hilly the next. Or you can try different equipment — using weight machines one session and free weights the next. If you always use the treadmill, expand your horizons by trying out the elliptical trainer or the rower.\\n\\nYou can also pair activities that focus on different aspects of fitness. For example, do yoga one day to work on your flexibility and engage your mind; the next day run on the treadmill while watching Law & Order.\\n\\nDress the Part\\n\\nWe’re not encouraging you to become a fitness-clothing junkie — or use the lack of a new outfit as an excuse to skip a workout. But buying snazzy new workout shorts or comfy new cross-trainers can really get you fired up to work out. Plus, you feel like a workout pro, and you let your fellow exer- cisers know you’re one of them.\\n\\nWhen Liz first started indoor rock climbing, she showed up in running shorts and a t-shirt. She noticed that all the good climbers wore tank tops and long sweat pants cut off at the bottom. Gradually, Liz conformed to the dress code and found out a few things. For one, the “in” crowd was more accepting of her because she looked serious about the sport. But more importantly, Liz realized there’s actually a reason rock climbers dress that way: The long sweats protect you from bumps and bruises. Cutting off the elastic at the bottom lets you move your legs and feet more freely. And a sleeveless top makes moving your arms easier.\\n\\nIf you find yourself really digging a certain activity, research the gear and equipment that you see everyone else wearing. A few choice items can put you into the right frame of mind for your workouts.\\n\\nKeep Yourself Entertained\\n\\nCombining exercise with life’s guilty pleasures can make your workout fly by. Maybe you’ll enjoy your treadmill power walk more if you do it while watch- ing reruns of Sex and the City or listening to the latest OutKast CD.\\n\\nThese days, you have more opportunities than ever to keep yourself enter- tained while you work out. Most gyms now have some sort of high-tech entertainment system that gives you access to TV, radio, CDs, and even the Internet. (We describe these systems in Chapter 9.)\\n\\n384 Part VIII: The Part of Tens\\n\\nIf you don’t go to a gym, you can carry your own radio or CD player while you exercise, as long as you exercise in a safe environment and remain aware of your surroundings. Portable CD players have improved to the point where they won’t skip even if you carry one while running. You can even find under- water tape players for swimming and water aerobics, and some pools pipe in underwater music. For the ultimate lightweight player, though, consider get- ting an iPod or other MP3 player, which can store hours of music and doesn’t require discs.\\n\\nRead Success Stories\\n\\nWe’re not talking about those before-and-after weight-loss ads in which a blubbery guy with a scowl on his face is miraculously transformed — “in just six weeks!” — into a grinning, chiseled hunk of muscle.\\n\\nNo, we’re referring to legitimate accounts of fitness success chronicled in magazines and on fitness Web sites. The good ones offer not only inspiration but specific and realistic advice. One woman featured in Shape magazine’s monthly “Success Stories” column wrote that she had ballooned to 226 pounds at age 23. (Get the magazine at your local newsstand or visit www. shapemag.com.) Fed up, she vowed to her husband that in one year, he wouldn’t recognize her. “That’s when I got the fire in my belly,” she wrote. In addition to cleaning up her diet, she walked a hilly 3-mile route each night after work. “My face was beet red, and I could barely breathe,” she recalled. Thirteen months later she had lost 96 pounds. “Best of all, I had gained self- confidence thanks to taking care of myself.”\\n\\nNot all fitness success stories are about weight loss. Some are about over- coming anorexia or starting to exercise for the first time at age 60 after a stroke. You can find success stories in other magazines as well, such as Fitness, Men’s Fitness, and Good Housekeeping.\\n\\nAppendix Educating Yourself\\n\\nclimber or you want to exercise with your kids. You’ll have more confi- dence and more fun with your workouts if you read about fitness in magazines or on the Internet, and you can keep abreast of the latest exercise techniques, workout gadgets, and nutrition controversies. And you can get inspirational tips from folks who overcame their inertia. Of course, you also can get com- pletely confused. Use this appendix to educate yourself.\\n\\nIt pays to educate yourself, whether you’re thinking about buying a stair-\\n\\nSifting Through Scientific Research\\n\\nIt seems as though every day in the news you hear about some new study that seems to contradict the one you heard the month before. First, chromium picolinate helps build muscle and burn fat; then, it’s a complete waste of money. One day you hear that one set of weight-training exercises builds as much strength as the traditional three; then you hear that three sets are actually better than one. How do you find out the truth?\\n\\nFirst, realize that there may not be a truth right now. It often takes decades for the scientific community to reach a consensus. That “startling new report” you hear about on TV may simply be one minuscule piece in a gigantic puzzle — one scientist’s best guess. But because of the way news is generated and reported, you may not get the full picture. Scientists sometimes overstate their findings because they want media attention or grant money. In the same way, stories are sometimes inaccurate because an expert passes along erroneous infor- mation. When reviewing studies done by scientists, journalists may hype ambiguous results because they need a big story. Or they may get the facts wrong because they had only two hours to decipher a 20-page study full of phrases like “deuterium oxide concentration was measured by using a fixed- filter single-beam infrared spectrophotometer.” Finally, when the news media hypes a story as “controversial,” the facts get a little lost.\\n\\n386 Fitness For Dummies, 3rd Edition\\n\\nStuff like this happens all the time. Sometimes readers don’t have any way to discern truth from fiction, but you can get a decent handle on the facts by paying attention to the way studies are reported. Consider reading the news- letters and Web sites of the American Council on Exercise (www.acefitness. org) and the Center for Science in the Public Interest (www.cspinet.org), both of which track the way scientific studies are reported — and distorted — in the media. Also check out WebMD (www.webmd.com) and Medline (www.med lineplus.gov). The following tips will also help you sort through the research that you read and hear about.\\n\\nLook for context\\n\\nDoes the news report mention how the latest research compares to the studies that came before it? The results of a single study may be a complete aberration.\\n\\nA few years ago, the media jumped on a study suggesting that kids who drank a lot of fruit juice were fatter than children who didn’t drink much juice. But the newspapers and TV stations failed to report a key fact: The study hadn’t considered the children’s exercise or overall eating habits. “Several studies had found before and have found since that you can’t blame it on the juice,” says registered dietitian Elizabeth Somer, a nutrition book author who fre- quently appears on Good Morning America. “It’s lack of exercise and their whole diet pattern that makes kids fat.” Somer stood in the studio cringing as the news anchor informed the nation that drinking juice is bad for kids. “They should never have even reported on that study,” says Somer, who couldn’t contradict the news anchor in her own nutrition segment.\\n\\nDon’t alter your lifestyle on the basis of one study. Many theories are later proven to be wrong. As late as the 1960s, many experts were still telling women that exercise would damage their uteruses.\\n\\nConsider the source\\n\\nA health study is more likely to be legit if it comes out of a major university or government agency rather than some mysterious, private institute. Some private companies and foundations do valid research, but many organizations with impressive-sounding names, like Sportlife Exercise Health Sciences Institute, are just facades for companies promoting their products. Look for the term independent research. A tobacco study done by RJ Reynolds or a rating of treadmill brands done by a treadmill manufacturer should fall under the category of things that make you go “Hmm.”\\n\\nAppendix: Educating Yourself\\n\\n387\\n\\nOn the other hand, just because a study was conducted at an elite university doesn’t mean it’s the gospel. Recently, the National Institutes of Health National Cholesterol Education Program (NCEP) made bold new recommendations for taking cholesterol-lowering statin drugs to reduce the risk of heart disease. Those studies are now under review, however, because, among other reasons, scientists brought to light that eight of the nine members of the panel making the recommendations had undisclosed financial ties to makers of statin drugs.\\n\\nDon’t assume cause and effect\\n\\nIf a study says that eating oat bran is linked to or is associated with low blood-cholesterol levels, this doesn’t mean eating oat bran causes low cho- lesterol levels. Maybe the oat bran eaters are health-conscious and get a lot of exercise. You have to ask, “Was it the oat bran or the exercise?” Also, take any individual study with a grain of salt; when several studies back certain findings, you can be far more sure of their validity.\\n\\nLook for comparison groups\\n\\nOne magazine article we came across touted the benefits of a powdered food replacement. As evidence, the article cited a study of 28 overweight women who cut their daily calories by taking the powder twice a day instead of food; the subjects also exercised three times a week. After two months, the article stated, “an astounding 100 percent” of the women lost weight and felt better. Astounding? Any overweight person who cuts calories and exercises regularly is going to see results after two months. For the study to have any validity, the researchers should have compared the group taking the powder with a control group of similar subjects who ate the same number of calories and followed the same exercise program but didn’t use the product.\\n\\nDo some math\\n\\nYou often read that a certain habit “doubles” the risk of death or “increases the risk of disease by 50 percent.” These figures can be misleading. In a study that followed 115,000 nurses for 16 years, researchers found that gaining 11 to 18 pounds in middle age raised the nurses’ heart disease risk by 25 percent. But the number of deaths in the study was so small that a 25 percent increase would mean the difference between 10 deaths in 10,000 people and 12 or 13 deaths in 10,000.\\n\\n388 Fitness For Dummies, 3rd Edition\\n\\nNotice the length of the study\\n\\nA four-week study doesn’t tell you whether a weight-loss pill or exercise regimen is safe or effective. Maybe a pill stops working after two months or a year.\\n\\nThe same goes for exercise programs. Several studies show that one set of weight training exercises builds as much strength as three sets, and these one-set studies have been well-publicized in fitness magazines. But the maga- zines typically don’t mention an important fact: Most of the one-set studies have lasted only three months. Only a handful of studies have tested subjects for a longer period of time, and these have generally shown that after four to six months, people doing one set tend to plateau while those doing three sets tend to continue making strength gains.\\n\\nPay attention to the number of subjects\\n\\nA study performed on a dozen people can’t tell you much of anything, but this doesn’t stop manufacturers from hyping research conducted with a sample size no larger than your morning workout group. The makers of an anti-cellulite pill, now in litigation, originally launched a massive national campaign to publicize an Italian study purported to show that their pill worked. But the study was conducted on only ten women. (Furthermore, the researchers who took the measurements knew which of the women were using the supplements.)\\n\\nDon’t make too much of animal studies\\n\\nThe way an obese mouse responds to a diet drug may not be the same way you respond. Chromium picolinate, a diet supplement touted on bottles as a “Super Reducer!” received plenty of good press. What you may not have heard is that most of the fat-loss studies have been performed on pigs. Human studies show that the supplement does not help humans lose weight.\\n\\nRecognize that people lie in surveys\\n\\nLarge studies usually rely on written questionnaires or phone surveys, a method that can lead to very misleading results. Subjects may not remember how many leafy green vegetables they ate last month, or they may exaggerate their exercise habits. According to the New England Journal of Medicine, nearly half of all research participants overestimate how much they exercise, and an equal percentage underestimate how much they eat.\\n\\nAppendix: Educating Yourself\\n\\n389\\n\\nFitness Magazines\\n\\nJust when the fitness-magazine industry seems to be saturated, along comes yet another magazine devoted to exercise, health, and nutrition. This is good news — we welcome more choices. Even better, fitness magazines are becom- ing more specialized, so you have an excellent chance of finding a magazine that speaks to you. There’s at least one fitness magazine to suit every type of exerciser: pregnant women, African American women, men in their 30s, walk- ers, swimmers, runners, cyclists, yoga practitioners, and cooking enthusiasts who want to be fit.\\n\\nBut the stiff competition makes some magazines resort to underhanded mar- keting tactics, including sensational headlines, misleading articles, and unin- formed writers. Ask a trainer or fitness-minded friend for magazine recommen- dations. Also, keep in mind the following tips for judging the fitness informa- tion you read in magazines.\\n\\nCheck out specialty magazines\\n\\nYou’re more likely to get good fitness information from magazines that spe- cialize in fitness than from general-interest or beauty magazines that mix in an occasional exercise article. This isn’t a hard-and-fast rule: Some main- stream magazines run perfectly good fitness stories, and some fitness maga- zines run perfectly lousy ones. But women’s fashion and beauty magazines are notorious for unrealistic promises like “Permanent Weight Loss! A Revolutionary Three-Week Plan.”\\n\\nBe especially wary of magazine pieces that offer fitness advice from celebrities; being a movie star doesn’t make you an exercise expert.\\n\\nBeware of sensational headlines\\n\\nStay away from magazines whose cover lines seem way too good to be true, such as “Drop 9 lbs. in 7 Days,” which is the fitness equivalent of “Elvis lives.” And if the fitness article is next to a story about Burt Reynolds’ ghost having a secret rendezvous with a two-headed man, you’re probably not getting your information from the right source. Tabloid rags have caught on to the fact that the American public is obsessed with weight loss, so what’s one more story about an alien diet or psychics predicting the health regimens that work?\\n\\nEven reputable fitness magazines run misleading headlines to draw in read- ers. Suzanne wrote an article for a health magazine debunking the myth that abdominal exercises can give you a flat midsection. But the magazine ran a headline that directly contradicted Suzanne’s story: “A Flat Tummy in 5 Minutes a Day.”\\n\\n390 Fitness For Dummies, 3rd Edition\\n\\nKnow that advertisers influence editorial copy\\n\\nThe editorial and advertising departments of journalistic publications are supposed to be like church and state: completely separate. In reality, health and fitness magazines sometimes abandon objectivity and censor or alter their stories to favor the companies that buy advertisements from them.\\n\\nProduct reviews are a good example. “At one magazine where I worked, we had to sugar-coat our shoe reviews because of advertising pressures,” says a writer we know. “With certain shoes, we had to search for aspects that weren’t negative and emphasize those. Like if a shoe was incredibly stiff, we’d write some innocuous copy about how the shoe had a good lacing system.”\\n\\nThe crumbling bridge between advertising and editorial is perhaps most evi- dent in a growing category of advertising called the advertorial. These are paid ads intended to look like regular articles. Typically, the layouts, type- face, and photos are very similar to the magazine’s editorial style so readers won’t make the distinction. The more manipulative advertorials even have bylines (for example, “By Joe Schmo”) so that the ads look like articles that have been written by regular reporters. Most magazines require advertisers to include the word advertisement at the top or bottom of the page, but some- times the type is so small it’s easy to miss.\\n\\nA prominent women’s magazine recently ran an advertorial on home exercise equipment. It was designed to look like an editorial product review, complete with a writer’s byline and a ratings system. (Surprise — all the products received the largest number of stars possible!) The word advertisement was printed in small, light red letters at the top of the first page.\\n\\nNewspapers\\n\\nWe’re glad daily papers have stepped up their fitness coverage, but don’t use the dailies as your only source of fitness information. Newspaper reporters tend to be very responsible about attributing information to experts. The problem is, given the reporters’ tight deadlines, they often have no choice but to interview the first available expert, who may not necessarily be the best expert (and may not be an expert at all). Magazine writers sometimes run into this problem, too.\\n\\nAlso, newspaper reporters tend to be jack-of-all-trades types who may not have the fitness experience to distinguish a real expert from a charlatan. Only the largest newspapers can afford to have reporters who cover the fitness beat exclusively.\\n\\nAppendix: Educating Yourself\\n\\n391\\n\\nEven though magazine articles are written three to six months before publica- tion, they’re often more up-to-date than newspapers. Many newspapers get their exercise ideas from reading fitness magazines. So, if you’re looking for articles about fitness trends, training techniques, and exercise equipment, mainstream fitness magazines tend to be better sources than daily papers.\\n\\nThe Internet\\n\\nSurfing the Internet for fitness information is a bit like entering into automated- phone-system hell: You press one key after another, and pretty soon, you’re either totally lost or back where you started. You may have the intention of finding out how to train your abdominals, but with a few unwitting clicks of the mouse, you’re downloading porn. Still, if you have the time and patience to look around, you can get some great fitness information online — from descriptions of the major yoga poses to the complete Surgeon General’s Report on Physical Activity and Health.\\n\\nHowever, you also can get plenty of hogwash. In general, you’ll come across more misleading and biased fitness information online than in mainstream fitness publications printed on paper. So perusing health and fitness Web sites with a particularly critical eye is important. Keep in mind that the line between advertising and editorial is particularly blurry on the Internet.\\n\\nIn addition, the “experts” quoted in online fitness articles may not be experts at all. Often, they’re people with products to sell. When a mainstream maga- zine publishes an article on heart-rate monitors, the story typically quotes coaches or university professors. But on one fitness Web site, we found a heart-rate-monitor article that quoted the executive assistant to the president of a heart-rate monitor manufacturer! “Anyone who is concerned about their weight, improved fitness, or athletic competition . . . can benefit from using a heart-rate monitor,” said the assistant. We agree, but the information doesn’t have a heckuva lot of credibility coming from someone who has a financial stake in the product.\\n\\nFinally, watch out for outdated information. You may think of the Internet as the most up-to-date of all media, but the Internet often doesn’t live up to its potential as the best source for late-breaking information. In an attempt to get Web sites up and running quickly — and to appear loaded with “content” — many sites are cluttered with ancient material.\\n\\nUse fitness Web sites as a starting point for educating yourself, but remember that the Internet is full of misinformation. Be sure to compare what you read online with what you read in magazines and newspapers.\\n\\n392 Fitness For Dummies, 3rd Edition\\n\\nIndex\\n\\nA •\\n\\nabdomen\\n\\nabdominal measurements, strength testing,\\n\\n27–28\\n\\ncircuit training, 244–246 hanging abs, 245 muscle structure, 183–185 strength training, 213–214 stretching exercises, 77–78 upper-abdominal curls, Pilates, 262\\n\\nAccu-Measure calipers, body-fat-percentage\\n\\ntests, 20\\n\\nanti-cellulite products, rip-offs, 374 Anusara yoga style, 250 anxiety, overdone exercises, 125 arms\\n\\narm measurements, body-fat-percentage\\n\\ntests, 21\\n\\nmuscle structure, 180–183 one-arm dumbbell row, total-body\\n\\nworkouts, 220–222\\n\\nstrengthening stations, circuit training,\\n\\n240–243\\n\\nasanas, yoga, 249–250 Astanga yoga style, 250\\n\\nACE (American Council on Exercise), 48, 286 Achilles tendonitis, 61–62 ACSM (American College of Sports Medicine),\\n\\nB •\\n\\n48, 286\\n\\nback exercises\\n\\nactive isolated stretching, 79–80 aerobics\\n\\nback expansion, stretching exercises, 73–74 back extension, total-body workouts,\\n\\ncalorie counting activities, 120–121 cardio exercises, 106 classes, 287–288, 291–292 exercise DVDs, 299 pregnancy exercises, 333–334 water, 158, 293–294\\n\\n235–236\\n\\nlower-back, circuit training, 244–246 lower-back, flexibility testing, 29 lower-back, pain, 63–64 muscle structures, 176–179\\n\\nbackground experience references, personal\\n\\nAFAA (Aerobics and Fitness Association\\n\\ntrainers, 50\\n\\nof America), 48, 286\\n\\nbackup goals, fitness planning and\\n\\nage considerations, exercising, 13 AIDS LifeCycle Web site, 380 alcohol consumption, nutrition, 86 Amazon Web site, 298 American College of Sports Medicine (ACSM),\\n\\n48, 286\\n\\ndevelopment, 35–36\\n\\nbalance techniques, skating, 154 ball crunches, 234 ballet classes, 291 balls, exercise, 324 bands\\n\\nAmerican Council on Exercise (ACE), 48, 286 amniotic fluid, leaking, overdone pregnancy\\n\\nhome gyms, 316–317 strength equipment, 202–203\\n\\nexercises, 338\\n\\nbarbells\\n\\nanaerobic threshold, heart rates, 111 Ananda yoga style, 250 Anderson, Kari (exercise instruction), 301 ankles\\n\\nankle measurements, body-fat-percentage\\n\\ntests, 21\\n\\nankle weights, home gyms, 317 flexibility tests, 30 sprains, avoiding, 60 anterior deltoids, 174\\n\\nbicep muscle exercises, 182 free weights, 196 home gyms, 320–321 tricep muscle exercises, 182 bargains, gym memberships, 271 basic cat, Pilates exercises, 264 Basic Yoga Workout For Dummies video\\n\\n(Sara Ivanhoe), 253\\n\\nbasketball, calorie counting activities, 120 beginning-level classes, 284\\n\\n394 Fitness For Dummies, 3rd Edition\\n\\nbench presses, pectoral-muscle exercises,\\n\\n180\\n\\nBeyond Basic Yoga For Dummies video\\n\\n(Sara Ivanhoe), 253\\n\\nBIA (bioelectrical impedance analysis), 23–24 biceps\\n\\ncurls, 228–229, 241 muscle structure, 181–182\\n\\nbikes, cycling.

Crowder from the United States\\n\\nMilitary Academy (USMA) Department of Physical Education for his work in assisting us in this project. He graciously allowed us to edit his work on cardio-respiratory training in order to tailor it towards ROTC cadets who have varying fitness needs at over 270 schools. Cadet Command would not have been successful in writing this Fitness Handbook without his help and the help of other fitness experts at the USMA and from the United States Army Physical Fitness School.\\n\\nBefore You Begin\\n\\nIt is imperative that cadets learn an easy way to reduce the likelihood of injury while\\n\\nusing this Fitness Handbook. Cadets need to recognize that they have an increased risk of lower body injuries than upper body injuries during summer training events. The leading causes of this are improperly sized or poorly broken-in boots and inadequate running shoes. Boots that hurt or uncomfortable to you at school will cause significantly more discomfort and increase the chance of injury during rigorous summer training events like the National Advanced Leadership Camp, Airborne School or Air Assault School. A broken in pair of boots should feel as comfortable as your most comfortable pair of shoes. To put it simply, you should be able to walk or run in them comfortably.\\n\\nSimilarly running shoes should fit comfortably and not show significant tread wear.\\n\\nRunning places different wear on your shoes than walking does. Using shoes you walk in for running can place undo stress on your lower body. This stress can increase the risk of injury. Field Manual 21-20 divides running shoes into three categories. Select an impact control shoe if you have high arches or notice that your running shoes tend to wear unevenly on the outside edge. Select a motion control shoe if you have flat feet or notice that excessive wear on both the extreme outside and inside of the sole of the running shoe. Select a balanced shoe if you have normal arches or only see wear on the outside sole beneath the ankle.\\n\\nOther factors that reduce the likelihood of injuries include adequate warm-ups prior to high intensity exercise, proper nutrition and hydration, maintaining recovery periods following exercise, and cool-down periods concluding the exercise.\\n\\nEditors Ms. Sheila Visconti\\n\\nMajor Paul Baker CPT Ellis Goins\\n\\n3\\n\\nPhysical Fitness\\n\\nTRAINING VARIABLES\\n\\nBefore explaining what a physical fitness program should look like, there are some basic\\n\\nterms that must be discussed. These principals apply to all programs in general and must be addressed in the development of any fitness program.\\n\\nINTENSITY – The amount of effort put into each workout, usually measured by heartbeats per minute. For the maximum benefit in each workout, plan on exercising at a minimum of 70 percent of the heart rate reserve. There are several scientific ways to your heart rate reserve. The simplest way is to begin with you maximum heart rate (220-Age). Next, measure your resting heart rate. The heart rate reserve is found by Max heart rate - resting heart rate. To train at 70% of the heart rate reserve you would multiply 70% by the heart rate reserve and then add your resting heart rate. For a 20 year old with a resting heart rate of 60 to dDetermineing your training heart rate in beats per minute would be 70% x Heart Rate Reserve =.70 x (200-60) + 60 (Resting Heart Rate) = a training heart rate of 158 beats per min.\\n\\nDURATION – The length each exercise period should last. There has been a great deal of research on this topic. Most experts believe that when working on your cardiovascular endurance a minimum of 20 to 30 minutes is needed to obtain maximum benefit. This holds true for the majority of the population. The only notable exception occurs for long distance or endurance athletes (e.g. marathon runners or triathletes).\\n\\nFREQUENCY – The number of workouts one should have per week. Once again experts\\n\\nagree that the average person requires a minimum of three workouts per week to improve their current level of fitness. Working out less frequently will only maintain a level of fitness; it will not improve the level of fitness. When exercising only three times a week, each period should be medium to high intensity. Exercising with consistent frequency can also be referred to as REGULARITY. Exercise must be done regularly to produce a training effect. Sporadic exercise may cause more harm in the form of injury than benefit from exercise. The same is true for extremely intense workouts. They may create injuries.\\n\\nRECOVERY – Do not work the same muscle groups hard day after day. Muscles\\n\\nneed recovery time. People frequently misunderstand this point. Providing inadequate recovery can explain the reason why most people see little or no gain from excessive exercise. You can work the same muscle groups each day, however, you should work hard one day and easy the next. This is a critical point because this fitness program is based on a six days a week exercise program.\\n\\nGENERAL ADAPTATION PRINCIPAL (GAP) – Muscles as well as your cardiovascular system in the body will adapt to the increasing stress placed upon it through exercise. To see gains in a fitness program one must stress the existing muscular and cardiovascular systems. This can also be called the OVERLOAD principal. For a muscle to increase in strength, the workload during exercise must be larger than what it normally experiences.\\n\\n4\\n\\nSPECIFICITY – There are several different exercises and events that can develop your\\n\\nmuscular strength as well as cardiovascular fitness. To increase the number of push-ups you can do, simply increase upper body strength through a number of strength exercises and weights. However, the best way to improve push-ups requires doing push-ups. Similarly one can improve cardiovascular fitness by biking swimming, or walking. However, if the goal remains an improved ability to run, the best exercise will be running.\\n\\nMAJOR COMPONENTS OF PHYSICAL FITNESS – There are several components of\\n\\nany fitness program. The three major components of most programs are flexibility, strength, muscular endurance, and cardiovascular endurance. These components are the essential elements of the Army Physical Fitness Program.\\n\\nHow to Use These Workout Programs\\n\\nThese programs are designed as four week plans. Each program has a workout A & B.\\n\\nAlternate workouts daily for 6 days, then rest. For example, perform workout A on Monday, Wednesday, and Friday; perform workout B on Tuesday, Thursday, and Saturday. Different muscles are trained in workouts A & B, which means you are training each muscle group 3 days per week. Rest Sunday. Work cardiovascular exercises into your workouts at least 3 times per week. You may attempt to eventually work up to doing cardio 6 days a week using the hard/easy technique mentioned under the recovery principle.\\n\\nFitness Assessment\\n\\nBefore starting any new fitness program it is important to assess ones abilities. This\\n\\nincludes knowing strengths as well as weaknesses. Ideally, a fitness program would improve weak areas and maintain or improve strength areas. However, before explaining the diagnostic test there are other important factors and preferences that should be identified. These factors and preferences may include the time of day to workout, how much time is available each day to workout, individual or team sports, and finally the goal of the fitness program.\\n\\nThe questionnaire attached (FORM 1-1) is intended to give a fitness trainer the basics\\n\\nthey need to personalize a fitness program that will works.\\n\\n5\\n\\nFitness Assessment Questionnaire\\n\\nNAME__________________________________ AGE___________ DATE________________\\n\\nACADEMIC SCHEDULE: Monday________________________________________________ (this Semester) Tuesday________________________________________________ Wednesday_____________________________________________ Thursday_______________________________________________ Friday__________________________________________________ Saturday________________________________________________\\n\\nEXERCISE HABITS/ PREFERENCES (Select One) I ____________________________ to exercise and ________________access to a gym (like, sometimes like, never want ) I like to workout _________________________________ (alone, in a small group, in a large group) I have ___________________discipline to stick to a fitness program ( a little, some, a lot of) I need ___________________________to stick to my fitness program (no help, some help, a lot of help) I ____________________________ to lift weights (like, have tried, have never tried) I prefer to ________________________ for my cardiovascular endurance training (run, walk, bike, swim, skate)\\n\\n(have, do not have)\\n\\nGOALS I want to:\\n\\nA.

This diagnostic test is composed of 6 events. The six events are as follows and will be performed in order. A brief warm-up period will precede the administration of the test. The warm up should consist of a combination of stretching exercises and jogging in place for 3 to 5 minutes.. The warm-up may consists of jogging in place for 3 minutes, starting slowly and increasing intensity to warm the body’s muscles and ligaments. Light stretching should follow the warm-up.\\n\\n1. First event: Bench Press. Cadets will perform a 1-rep maximum of this exercise to determine chest, shoulders, and triceps strength. A cadet should begin with a weight which they are confident they can press. Allow at least 1 minute rest between attempts. The weight will be increased at the cadet’s request and he will perform the exercise again. Allow no more than 5 attempts to reach the 1-rep maximum. Any failed attempt terminates the exercise. The last correct repetition will count as the 1-rep maximum.\\n\\nFigure 1\\n\\n(1) Equipment. Flat weight bench. At least 1, preferably 2 spotters. Lifting gloves are authorized. Bench press shirts are not authorized. (2) Performance. Lie in a supine position on a flat bench with your legs positioned at the sides of the bench and your feet flat on the floor. Using a handgrip that is about 6 inches wider than your shoulder width, bring the barbell to arms length above the chest but in line with the shoulders (see fig 1). If two spotters are available they will position themselves on each side of the bar. The spotters may assist in the liftoff. If only one spotter is available, he/she will be at the lifter’s head to assist. Once the bar is at the start position the spotter will release the bar. Lower the barbell to the chest and make a definite pause. As soon as momentum has ceased the grader will yell press. Press the barbell to the start position to complete the repetition. The spotter will not touch the barbell during the repetition\\n\\n7\\n\\nunless absolutely necessary. If the spotter has to assist the lifter during the repetition the event is terminated.\\n\\nUpper Body Strength = 1 rep max in pounds divided by body weight in pounds\\n\\n5 4 3 2 1\\n\\nMales greater than 1.26 1.17 - 1.25 .97 - 1.16 .88 - .96 less than .87\\n\\n5 4 3 2 1\\n\\nFemales greater than .78 .72 - .77 .59 - .71 .53 - .58 less than .52\\n\\n2. Second Event: Push-up. Cadets will perform as many push-ups as they can to determine the muscular endurance of the chest shoulder, and triceps muscles.\\n\\n(1) Equipment. Flat area.\\n\\n(2) Performance. On the command \\'get set,\\' assume the front-leaning rest position by placing your hands where they are comfortable for you. Your feet may be together or up to 12 inches apart. When viewed from the side, your body should form a generally straight line from your shoulders to your ankles. On the command \\'go,\\' begin the push-up by bending your elbows and lowering your entire body as a single unit until your upper arms are at least parallel to the ground. Then, return to the starting position by raising your entire body until your arms are fully extended. Your body must remain rigid in a generally straight line and move as a unit while performing each repetition. At the end of each repetition, the scorer will state the number of repetitions you have completed correctly. If you fail to keep your body generally straight, to lower your whole body until your upper arms are at least parallel to the ground, or to extend your arms completely, that repetition will not count, and the scorer will repeat the number of the last correctly performed repetition. An altered, front-leaning rest position is the only authorized rest position. That is, you may sag in the middle or flex your back. When flexing your back, you may bend your knees, but not to such an extent that you are supporting most of your body weight with your legs. If this occurs, your performance will be terminated. You must return to, and pause in, the correct starting position before continuing. If you rest on the ground or raise either hand or foot from the ground, your performance will be terminated. You may reposition your hands and/or feet during the event as long as they remain in contact with the ground at all times. Correct performance is important. You will do as many push-ups as you can; there is no time limit.\\n\\n3. Third Event: Curl-up. Cadets will perform the curl-up exercise to assess abdominal strength and endurance.\\n\\n(1) Equipment. Mat, Ruler, metronome, stop watch\\n\\n(2) Performance. Start with your back on the floor with your knees bent at a 90 degree angle (feet 12 to 18 inches away from the buttocks). Place your arms by your sides with palms down on the floor, elbows locked, and fingers straight. The grader will place a ruler or draw a line 12 cm away from the longest finger tip and set metronome to a cadence of 50 beats per\\n\\n8\\n\\nminute. Curl your head and upper back upward, keeping arms stiff, reaching forward along the floor to touch the line. Your fingers, feet and buttocks must stay on the floor during the entire curl-up. Slide the palms of the hands (extended arms) along the mat until the fingertips of both hands just touch the 12 cm line. Keep the arms straight. Lower your body until the back is flat against the ground. Perform the movement following the cadence of the metronome (25 curl-ups per minute). Take the same amount of time to perform the raising and lowering phases. The test score is the number of complete touches on the line until the rhythm cannot be followed. If you do not have a Metronome, conduct standard bent knee sit-ups with your hands crossed over your chest. Do as many as you can in a 2 minute period.\\n\\nAGE\\n\\nMale 15-19\\n\\n20-29\\n\\n30-39\\n\\nExcellent\\n\\n>74\\n\\n>74\\n\\n>74\\n\\nAbove Average\\n\\n35 - 74\\n\\n31 - 74\\n\\n36 - 74\\n\\nAverage\\n\\n24 - 34\\n\\n24 - 30\\n\\n26 - 35\\n\\nBelow Average\\n\\n8 - 23\\n\\n4 - 23\\n\\n0 - 23\\n\\nAGE\\n\\nFemale 15-19\\n\\n20-29\\n\\n30-39\\n\\nExcellent\\n\\n>74\\n\\n>69\\n\\n>54\\n\\nAbove Average\\n\\n30 - 74\\n\\n30 - 69\\n\\n28 - 54\\n\\nAverage\\n\\n24 - 29\\n\\n21 - 29\\n\\n15 - 27\\n\\nBelow Average\\n\\n10 - 23\\n\\n5 - 20\\n\\n0 - 14\\n\\nFourth Event: Step Test. Cadets will perform the 3-minute step test to determine cardiovascular endurance. (1) Equipment. Metronome, 12 inch step, stopwatch. (2) Performance. Cadets will step up (1-2) and down (3-4) in cadence with the metronome which is set at 96 beats per minute (4 clicks = one step cycle) for a stepping rate of 24 steps per minute. Cadets will step up and down on the 12-inch bench for 3 minutes. Immediately after the 3-minute stepping exercise, the cadet is to sit down and within 5 seconds, the tester is to take the subject\\'s heart rate for one minute. The total one-minute post-exercise heart rate is the subject\\'s score for the test. Compare to YMCA Norms below. In the event you do not have a Metronome, the tester will count one step-two step-three step-four step in an attempt to come close to 96 beats per minute. Needless to say, this will result in a less accurate evaluation. Example: A 18- year old female performs the step test with a final heart rate of 95. Looking at the table she falls under the above average profile.\\n\\n9\\n\\nPhysical Fitness Evaluation on Profile for 3-Minute Step Test (Heart Rate values in beats per minute)\\n\\nAGE\\n\\nMALE 18-25\\n\\n26-35\\n\\n36-45\\n\\nClassification Excellent Good Above Average Average Below Average Poor Very Poor\\n\\nAGE\\n\\n70-78 79-88 89-97 98-104 105-114 115-128 129-164 FEMALE 18-25\\n\\n73-79 80-88 89-97 98-106 109-116 117-126 127-164\\n\\n26-35\\n\\n72-81 82-94 95-102 103-111 112-118 119-128 129-168\\n\\n36-45\\n\\nClassification Excellent Good Above Average Average Below Average Poor Very Poor\\n\\n70-78 79-88 89-97 98-104 105-114 115-128 129-164\\n\\n73-79 80-88 89-97 98-106 109-116 117-126 127-164\\n\\n72-81 82-94 95-102 103-111 112-118 119-128 129-168\\n\\n10\\n\\n5. Fifth Event: Sit & Reach. Cadets will perform the sit and reach to determine hamstring and lower back flexibility.\\n\\n(1) Equipment. Ruler.\\n\\n(2) Performance. Sit on the floor with legs out straight ahead and shoes off. The tester holds both knees flat against the floor. Lean forward slowly as far as possible and hold the greatest stretch for two seconds. Make sure there is no jerky movements, and that the fingertips remain level and the legs flat. The score is recorded as the distance before (negative) or beyond (positive) from the toes. Repeat twice and record the best score.

Sixth Event: Illinois Agility Run Test. Cadets will perform the Illinois Agility Run Test to test agility.\\n\\n(1) Equipment. flat surface (minimum 20m x10m area), 8 cones, a stop watch.\\n\\n(2) Course. The length of the course is 10 meters and the width (distance between the start and finish points) is 5 meters. On the track you could use 5 lanes. 4 cones can be used to mark the start, finish and the two turning points. Each cone in the center is spaced 3.3 meters apart.\\n\\nGender Excellent Above Average\\n\\nAverage\\n\\nBelow Average\\n\\nPoor\\n\\nMale\\n\\n<15.2 secs\\n\\n15.2 - 16.1 secs\\n\\n16.2 - 18.1 secs 18.2 - 18.3 secs\\n\\n>18.3 secs\\n\\nFemale <17.0 secs\\n\\n17.0 - 17.9 secs\\n\\n18.0 - 21.7 secs 21.8 - 23.0 secs\\n\\n>23.0 secs\\n\\n12\\n\\nAdministration. Professors of Military Science & Leadership (PMS) should administer the diagnostic test in the assessment phase of the fitness program development. Use the Diagnostic Test Score Card provided. The next diagnostic test should occur no later than week six. Subsequent diagnostic tests should be given every six weeks. After the initial diagnostic it is acceptable to substitute the APFT as a diagnostic tool. PMSs or their designated fitness expert should regularly monitor the fitness logs of cadets and provide guidance as needed.\\n\\nDiagnostic Test Score Card\\n\\nLast Name\\n\\nFirst Name\\n\\nMI\\n\\nGender M or F\\n\\nAge\\n\\nHeight _____inches\\n\\nWeight ______lbs\\n\\nBody Fat ______%\\n\\nBench Press\\n\\nLift 1_____ 2_____ 3_____ 4_____ 5_____\\n\\n1-RM = lbs\\n\\n1 Rep Maximum Divided by Bodyweight =\\n\\nPush-up\\n\\nRepetitions_______\\n\\nCurl-up\\n\\nRepetitions_______\\n\\nStep Test\\n\\n1-minute post-exercise heart rate _______beats\\n\\nSit & Reach\\n\\nDistance from toes (+ or -) ________cm\\n\\nIllinois Agility Run Test\\n\\nTime____________\\n\\n13\\n\\nFlexibility\\n\\nFlexibility is an important component of your fitness program. Many activity- related\\n\\ninjuries have their root in lack of flexibility. Think of your muscles as rubber bands. When they are cold they are rigid and brittle. When warm they stretch and retract more easily. Conducting a good warm-up prior to exercising and a good cool-down upon completion will help prevent injury and reduce muscle soreness.\\n\\nNo matter what your current fitness level, you should always begin your exercise sessions\\n\\nwith a warm-up. A good warm-up sequence is as follows. Jog in place or a specified location for one to two minutes. This causes a gradual increase in the heart rate, blood pressure, circulation, and increases the temperature of the active muscles. Next, perform slow joint rotation exercises (for example, arm circles, knee/ankle rotations) to gradually increase the joint\\'s range of motion. Work each major joint for 5 to 10 seconds. Finally, stretch the muscles to be used during the upcoming activity slowly. This will \"loosen up\" muscles and tendons so they can achieve greater ranges of motion with less risk of injury. Hold each stretch position for 10 to 15 seconds, and do not bounce or bob.\\n\\nImmediately following your exercise session stretch as part of your cool-down. After\\n\\nexercising, when your muscles are their warmest is the best time to improve your flexibility. Do not limit flexibility exercises to warm-up and cool-down only. Take the time to dedicate sessions to flexibility. Stretching throughout the day is also a great idea. Stretching is one form of exercise that takes very little time relative to the benefits gained. Some of the more common flexibility exercises are listed under the flexibility exercises. Assume all stretching positions slowly until you feel tension or slight discomfort. Hold each position for at least 10 to 15 seconds during the warm-up and cool-down. Developmental stretching to improve flexibility requires holding each stretch for 30 seconds or longer.\\n\\n14\\n\\nPROGRAM DESCRIPTION\\n\\nThese Fitness Work-out sheets are designed to be implemented on a workout plan A\\n\\nfollowed the next day by a workout plan B. Workout A will focus on lower body strength and endurance while workout plan B will focus on upper body strength and endurance. Both days incorporate some abdominal work. Remember it is important to maintain a period of recovery for the abdominal muscles. Trying to overachieve early in a workout program can lead to injury. The reason there is a range within the abdominal exercises is to promote recovery. If you are providing yourself adequate time to recover, over time you should see your abilities increasing.\\n\\nThe cardiorespiratory workouts need to be included into the program. If the program\\n\\nselected is exclusively running (e.g. group run, fartlek, or interval) it should replace the A workout plan. However, if you choose a guerrilla or grass drill workout plan it could substitute for either the A or the B Workout plan. The minimum frequency of cardiorespiratory workouts is two to three per week. For borderline runners the number of workouts may be as high as three to five per week and may consist of a combination of intervals, grass, and guerrilla drills. The determining factor for the intensity and frequency of cardiorespiratory training will depend on the ability and fitness level of the cadet and the intensity of the workout.\\n\\nFor some reason if you miss A workout then the next workout would be the A workout.\\n\\nIn a week you should expect to do a total of six workouts per week.\\n\\n15\\n\\nThe Road to Fitness\\n\\nWORKOUT A\\n\\nEXERCISE\\n\\nSQUAT Set 1 12-15 reps Set 2 12-15 reps Set 3 12-15 reps LEG CURLS Set 1 12-15 reps Set 2 12-15 reps Set 3 12-15 reps Deadlifts Set 1 12-15 reps Set 2 12-15 reps Set 3 12-15 reps LEG EXTENSION Set 1 12-15 reps Set 2 12-15 reps Set 3 12-15 reps CALF RAISES Set 1 12-15 reps Set 2 12-15 reps Set 3 12-15 reps\\n\\nWEEK 1 WEEK 2 WEEK 3 WEEK 4 Weight/Reps Weight/Reps\\n\\nWeight/Reps\\n\\nWeight/Reps\\n\\nWeight/Reps\\n\\n/ / /\\n\\n/ / /\\n\\n/ / /\\n\\nWeight/Reps / / / Weight/Reps / / / Weight/Reps / / / Weight/Reps\\n\\nWeight/Reps / / / Weight/Reps / / / Weight/Reps / / / Weight/Reps\\n\\nWeight/Reps\\n\\nWeight/Reps\\n\\nWeight/Reps\\n\\n/ / /\\n\\n/ / /\\n\\n/ / /\\n\\n/ / / ABDOMINAL\\n\\nWeight/Reps\\n\\n/ / /\\n\\n/ / / Weight/Reps / / /\\n\\n/ / / Weight/Reps / / /\\n\\n/ / /\\n\\nWeight/Reps\\n\\n/ / /\\n\\nSIT-UP 1 minute SWISS-BALL CRUNCH 1 minute REVERSE CRUNCH 1 minute\\n\\nBeginner Routine: Do one set of 12-15 reps of each exercise. Use a weight that you can lift at least 12 times. When you complete 15 reps, increase the weight at your next workout. Move quickly from exercise to exercise, resting at most 30 seconds between exercises unless you are exceeding your training heart rate. If you are, increase the rest period between exercises. As you progress, you should be able to decrease the rest between exercises while maintaining your training heart rate.\\n\\nSPEED: Perform each rep deliberately slower than what seems like your natural speed. This keeps your muscles under tension longer and helps build them faster.\\n\\n16\\n\\nEXERCISE\\n\\nThe Road to Fitness WORKOUT B WEEK 1\\n\\nWEEK 2\\n\\nWEEK 3\\n\\nWEEK 4\\n\\nBENCH PRESS Set 1 12-15 reps Set 2 12-15 reps Set 3 12-15 reps\\n\\nINCLINE BENCH PRESS Set 1 12-15 reps Set 2 12-15 reps Set 3 12-15 reps DUMBELL SHOULDER PRESS\\n\\nWeight/Reps\\n\\n/ / /\\n\\nWeight/Reps\\n\\n/ / /\\n\\nWeight/Reps\\n\\nWeight/Reps\\n\\n/ / / Weight/Reps\\n\\n/ / / Weight/Reps\\n\\nWeight/Reps\\n\\n/ / / Weight/Reps\\n\\n/ / / Weight/Reps\\n\\nWeight/Reps\\n\\n/ / / Weight/Reps\\n\\n/ / / Weight/Reps\\n\\nSet 1 12-15 reps Set 2 12-15 reps Set 3 12-15 reps\\n\\nLATERAL RAISES\\n\\n/ / /\\n\\nWeight/Reps\\n\\n/ / / Weight/Reps\\n\\n/ / / Weight/Reps\\n\\n/ / / Weight/Reps\\n\\nSet 1 12-15 reps Set 2 12-15 reps Set 3 12-15 reps\\n\\nDIPS Set 1 12-15 reps Set 2 12-15 reps Set 3 12-15 reps\\n\\n/ / /\\n\\nWeight/Reps\\n\\n/ / /\\n\\n/ / / Weight/Reps\\n\\n/ / /\\n\\n/ / / Weight/Reps\\n\\n/ / /\\n\\n/ / / Weight/Reps\\n\\n/ / /\\n\\nWEIGHTED SIT-UP REVERSE CRUNCH BODY TWIST\\n\\nABDOMINAL 15-25 15-25 15-25\\n\\nBeginner Goals: Exercise consistently with short focused workouts. Build endurance through high-repetition strength training and moderate intensity cardiovascular exercise. See rapid increases in strength and modest gains in muscle mass. Advanced Goals: You’ll focus more energy on strength training. Help your body recover from nagging injuries with short, low volume routines. You should leave the gym feeling as if you could have done a lot more.

Americans are getting unhealthier each year. Health-related disease such as diabetes, hypertension, cardiovascular disorders, and various forms of cancer are at an all-time high. We must consider the effect of excess weight on our joints and backs, not to mention the psychological effects on our self-esteem and confidence!\\n\\nHave you ever noticed that people who are active or play sports always seem to be able to do more things – they just appear to enjoy life more than their sedentary, unfit counterparts. Of course, fit people generally do not smoke, so they are less likely to get cancer than smokers. They generally don\\'t carry a lot of excess body fat so they suffer fewer heart attacks than those unfit. Fit people have stronger lungs, muscles, joints, bones, immune system, and healthier hearts. Their cholesterol levels and blood pressure measurements are better. With these facts in mind, you can see why we are so passionate about the benefits of exercise and a healthy lifestyle.\\n\\nMost people recognize the benefits of exercise and eating well. Many have good intentions and decide to make some changes. In fact, Americans have no problem initiating the process. We have done it numerous times. We tend to lose the same fat over and over again. Our struggle lies in the challenge of keeping the weight off. Most people who undertake an exercise and nutrition program have not really taken the time to fully understand the complexity of the process. If you are going to be successful at initiating these major changes in your life and, more importantly, maintaining the changes, you are going to have to establish a very strong foundation for success.\\n\\nThere are literally hundreds of exercises, nutrition, fat loss and health books on the shelves at book stores; with most of these books, you read them and then they go back on the bookshelf. By the time you start to initiate any of the changes, you have forgotten what those changes were in the first place and you have probably lost the motivation anyway. This manual is an interactive tool. You will regularly be asked to take action towards your goals. You will be asked to answer questions and complete homework drills. This will force you to implement the information immediately and keep your goals at the top of your priorities.\\n\\nResearch demonstrates that the safest and most effective program for optimal health and ideal weight management is a program that combines exercise and a healthy diet. This workbook will focus on that combination. You will learn the most effective exercise and nutrition tips for improving your overall health, fitness and energy levels. Research also shows that you must be involved in the process to enhance success. You know your body and life better than anyone. It’s never successful if we just blindly tell a client what to do without considering their individual scenario. So we need you to help us help you! We are firm believers that there is no quick-fix solution. If you want something enough, expect to put forth a bit of effort. You know what they say - if anything is worth getting, it is worth working for! So, it will not be a ‘walk in the park’, but we can guarantee that it is probably not going to be as difficult as you would imagine. Every drill in this book will take you closer to success. Every homework assignment you complete will give you the confidence and self-esteem to know you can accomplish the next goal. It is all about \"Results Momentum\". If we ask you to do something – even a very small task – when you complete it, you have succeeded. This will give you momentum so the next goal becomes that much easier. If you do not do the task – no matter how insignificant, it makes it easier to skip out on other tasks – perhaps those that are much more important to your success. Think of this process as a series of very small baby steps and each one takes you closer and closer to your PERSONAL BEST!\\n\\nLet\\'s get started right away. Remember, we have full confidence that you can do this because we know \"If you think you can, you can!\" Plus we are here to support you throughout the entire process.\\n\\n9\\n\\nFitness & Training Makeover Commitment\\n\\nThe purpose of this agreement is to serve as a reminder of the commitment that you have made to yourself and to provide a list of the health behaviors that we will help you to adopt over the next few weeks and for the rest of your life. This page is an overview of the program expectations. In the rest of this manual we will explain details and help you to understand why each of these areas are important to your overall health and success. Consider this a sneak peak. We welcome you to begin tackling any of these areas immediately. You have made one of the best decisions of your life!\\n\\nAn Optimal Health and Fitness Program includes:\\n\\n\\uf0a9\\uf020 Exercising aerobically 3-6 days each week for 20-60 minutes each session at various levels of intensity. Using a Heart rate monitor will keep you honest. Activities like walking, jogging, cycling, swimming, rowing, hiking, stair-climbing, or Group classes will do the trick.\\n\\n\\uf0a9\\uf020 Conditioning your muscles with resistance training workouts for a minimum of two times per week. One set of 8-12 reps of a variety of exercises for 20-60 minutes is perfect! Or just workout with your trainer and they’ll make sure you meet this requirement. Our Group Muscle Conditioning programs will help you achieve this goal also.\\n\\n\\uf0a9\\uf020 Eating a balanced diet that is high in fiber content.\\n\\n\\uf0a9\\uf020 Eating 5 vegetable servings and 3 fruit servings each day.\\n\\n\\uf0a9\\uf020 Drinking 10—8ounce glasses of water each day. Drink water before and with each meal and snack.\\n\\nPurchasing a Jumbo size water bottle will help you adhere to this tip.\\n\\n\\uf0a9\\uf020 Planning your meals so that you eat 3 small meals and 2 small snacks each day. Try to eat every 3 hours.\\n\\n\\uf0a9\\uf020 Avoiding eating anything high in fat or calories 3 hours before bedtime.\\n\\n\\uf0a9\\uf020 Controlling portion sizes. If you need more assistance regarding exact caloric requirements, visit our website at www.nwwomensfitness.com Click on the “Member Zone”. Then click on “Cool Fitness Tools”. There is a calculator that you can use to more accurately estimate your calorie and protein needs. You will also find various articles that will help you on your journey.\\n\\n\\uf0a9\\uf020 Eliminating any unhealthy temptations from your environment (work, home, car) and replacing with healthy\\n\\nalternatives.\\n\\n\\uf0a9\\uf020 Grocery shopping at least once per week to stock up on healthy choices and fresh fruits and veggies.\\n\\n\\uf0a9\\uf020 Maintaining a more active daily lifestyle. Move your body as much as you can in addition to your exercise\\n\\nprogram. The International Journal of Obesity released a statistic that reported we expend an average of 500- 800 fewer calories than we did a few decades ago because of our more sedentary lifestyle. At NW Women’s Fitness Club, we believe that all you have to do is start moving more in your life and then you won\\'t have to spend hours in the gym every week!\\n\\n\\uf0a9\\uf020 Getting enough sleep (7-8 hours per night). Sleep is when your body recovers and repairs. If you do not sleep\\n\\nenough, you will not be prepared for each workout session and you will not function optimally.\\n\\n\\uf0a9\\uf020 Controlling and managing your stress levels. Identify your stresses. Outline methods that help you to reduce\\n\\nyour stress and practice them regularly.\\n\\n\\uf0a9\\uf020 Completing Activity and Nutrition logs every day and submitting to your trainer every week. Samples are\\n\\nprovided for you in Section Seven.\\n\\n\\uf0a9\\uf020 Weekly weigh-ins and monthly measurements help to manage your progress if fat loss is your goal.\\n\\nI promise to follow the above recommendations to the best of my ability.\\n\\nDate:__________________ Signed:_______________________________________\\n\\nDate:__________________ Witness Signature:______________________________\\n\\nNote: Have someone witness your commitment that will love and support you through this process. It will hold you accountable to your commitment and everyone can benefit from their own personal cheerleader!\\n\\n10\\n\\nSECTION TWO\\n\\nLIFESTYLE COACHING Setting the Foundation for Success\\n\\n“What lies behind us\\n\\nand what lies before us\\n\\nare small matters\\n\\ncompared to what lies within us…”\\n\\n11\\n\\n12\\n\\nLaws of Success\\n\\nDid you know that 70% of people who start an exercise program drop out within the first two to three months? These are not good odds! It\\'s now widely accepted that the problem has nothing to do with the person but rather with the process. You see, most people who want to start exercising just start. Imagine if you wanted to build a house. You\\'d start out with an architectural plan first to know exactly what you wanted your house to look like. Or what if you wanted to start a business? The banks would require a business plan first, right? They\\'d want to ensure that you\\'ve really thought it through carefully and you\\'ve got a good plan to enhance success. Well, these same guidelines apply to exercise. You\\'ve got to have a plan for success. This is why the first few months of your fitness experience are so important. This is when most people drop out. So at NW Women’s Fitness Club we focus on getting you past this stage to the point where you’re experiencing great results – and that alone, will help to motivate you to keep going. The problem is most people stop exercising before they even had the chance to see the changes to their body. We just won’t let that happen to you!\\n\\nAfter working with various clients for a number of years, we\\'ve noticed a number of characteristics that separate those who succeed with their fitness program from those who do not. Those who succeed buy into the \"Four Laws of Success\". You must be ready to accept these laws without exception.\\n\\nFirst Law – THE LAW OF POSSESSION. You need to understand that if you are going to achieve results, it is going to be up to you. The phrases \"If it’s going to be, it’s up to me\" or \"If I think I can or think I can\\'t, I\\'m right,\" ring very true. You have to take ultimate responsibility for success or failure. Sometimes clients believe their trainer is going to be the one who makes it happen for them. At Northwest Personal Training, we set them straight right away. All we can do is educate and guide. Our clients must be willing to make and stick to the changes. You cannot completely rely on someone else (like a personal trainer or workout partner) to make it happen for you and likewise, you cannot blame the kids or your partner for any failures.\\n\\nSecond Law – THE LAW OF EFFORT. Anything worth achieving is worth working for. Exercise and healthy eating takes discipline, will power, character, persistence, and a commitment to delayed gratification.\\n\\nThird Law – THE LAW OF CONSISTENCY. A month-long effort is not going to get you where you want. In order to achieve any goal, you must stick to your game plan for the long-term. Getting off track for a week is no big deal if you are consistent in your efforts, but if you are regularly tempted away from your program, you will not succeed. Consistency and persistency are the keys to manifesting any goal. Remember that if you want to be 10 pounds thinner 10 years from now, it is not what you do over the next eight weeks that matters. It is what you do over the next 10 years! All the changes we will suggest must be followed for the rest of your life - so of course, we are going to make room for indulgences. The program has got to be realistic if you\\'re going to stick to it. There are no short-term, quick fix solutions. Researchers have found only one characteristic common to those who succeed with exercise. All such people move toward their goal one step at a time. They are committed to constant, never- ending improvement. In practical terms, it means that regardless of anything else – busy work schedules, lack of energy, lack of time, feeling old, feeling lazy, hating exercise – they make no excuses! They keep exercising, taking their long-term goals and splitting them up into smaller goals. They take it one day at a time.\\n\\nFourth Law – THE LAW OF SELF-EFFICACY. If you are already questioning whether or not you can actually make the required changes, you are going to have a difficult time with your program. You must believe you can do it! Think of self-esteem as a bank. Each time you keep a promise to yourself, the store of self-esteem gets bigger, making it easier to keep the next promise to yourself. It\\'s all about \"Results Momentum\" - achieving one result gives you the confidence to achieve the next goal. Each time a promise is broken, however, your self-esteem goes down, making it easier to break the next promise. Reinforce this belief in yourself by surrounding yourself with others who are doing or have accomplished what you\\'re attempting. After all, if they can do it, so can you! We’ve got plenty of success stories at NW Women’s Fitness Club to inspire you to Reach for your Best!\\n\\n13\\n\\nReadiness\\n\\nWe supply the following questionnaires to new clients to help us determine where they are on the readiness scale. If you score low, this may not be the best time for you to initiate major changes to your lifestyle. It does not mean, however, that you cannot begin the process. You can still start the program and work on developing healthy patterns, but you should have lower expectations of yourself. If you score moderately, expect a few struggles on route towards your goals. If you score high, this is the perfect time for you to begin taking action towards your goals. Note: If you have been adhering to a consistent exercise and nutrition program for six or more months, you can skip this assignment.\\n\\nReadiness questionnaire I\\n\\nYes No\\n\\nDo you feel you are at some sort of health risk because of your current behaviors/\\n\\nlifestyle?\\n\\nDo you feel that making lifestyle changes will improve your quality of life and\\n\\ndecrease your risk of health-related disorders?\\n\\nDo you view your health and fitness program as a lifetime goal rather than a short-\\n\\nterm temporary goal?\\n\\nAre you willing to get personally involved in planning a health and fitness\\n\\nprogram?\\n\\nAre you willing to try different approaches?\\n\\nDo you have the patience to accept success in small increments and deal with\\n\\npossible setbacks?\\n\\nAre you willing to set realistic goals?\\n\\nAre you willing to make lifestyle changes?\\n\\nIf you answered yes to all these questions, you are ready for action! If you said no to one or more of the questions, you might experience resistance as you begin to initiate many of the actions required to achieve your goals. It may be helpful for you to review what is really important to you and learn more about the negative effects of your current behavior and the benefits of change.\\n\\nReadiness questionnaire II\\n\\n1\\n\\n2\\n\\n3\\n\\n4\\n\\n5\\n\\n1. Compared to previous attempts, how motivated are you this time to adhere to your exercise program? 2. How certain are you that you will stay committed to an exercise program for the time it will take to reach your goal? 3. Considering all outside factors in your life - work, stress, family obligations, etc. - to what extent can you tolerate the effort required to stick to a lifetime exercise and nutrition plan? 4. Think honestly about your goals. How realistic are they?\\n\\n5. How confident are you that you will be able to make changes to your current eating behaviors? 6. How confident are you that you can work regular exercise into your daily schedule starting tomorrow?\\n\\nNot at all motivated\\n\\nNot at all certain\\n\\nCannot tolerate\\n\\nVery unrealistic Not at all confident\\n\\nNot at all confident\\n\\nExtremely motivated\\n\\nExtremely certain\\n\\nCan toler- ate easily\\n\\nVery realistic Extremely confident\\n\\nExtremely confident\\n\\nScore: 6-12: Low motivation 13-25: Moderate motivation\\n\\n25+: High motivation\\n\\n14\\n\\nInternal Motivation\\n\\nIf you want to change something (your weight, your nutrition habits), you have got to change something! Makes sense, doesn\\'t it? But change is difficult. Most people attempt major changes in their life without setting up a framework for success. How can you get anywhere without a map or a game plan?\\n\\nFinding the motivation and inspiration to adhere to the changes in your life day-in, day-out, is challenging. Many people have very good intentions and start an exercise or healthy nutrition program, but within a few months 70 percent of them have dropped out. When people quit, it’s because they can’t find a reason to keep going. Motivation boils down to being sick and tired of the situation you’re in now and associating pleasure with the situation you will be in once you achieve your goal. If you can associate enough displeasure with your present scenario and enough excitement towards achieving your goals, you’ll pinpoint your personal motivation for exercise and healthy eating and find it much easier to stick with the program.\\n\\nNote: If you have been adhering to a consistent exercise and nutrition program for six or more months, you can skip this assignment.\\n\\nWrite down all the reasons you’re not satisfied with your present situation. Write down what will happen if you don’t make some changes to your lifestyle. For example, none of your clothes fit, you have no energy, your blood pressure has risen, you can’t sit comfortably in chairs, you feel embarrassed to wear a bathing suit, you keep gaining more and more weight every year, your cholesterol is getting out of control, you could actually die…\\n\\nWrite down all the reasons you want to achieve your goals. Write down how your life will be better. For example, you’ll be able to wear whatever you want, your energy will improve, your blood pressure will drop, you’ll feel comfortable in any environment, you’ll be more productive at work, you’ll feel more self-confident, you’ll lower your risk for developing heart disease, cancer, osteoporosis, you’ll have enough energy to go hiking, play with your kids/grandkids….\\n\\n15\\n\\nFitness Wish List\\n\\nIn the following space, write down all the fitness goals you would like to achieve. This is your personal fitness wish list. Write down anything you have ever thought of achieving with regards to your own individual health and fitness. Which goal, if you achieved it, would make this year unbelievable? Have you ever wanted to hike the Grand Canyon, complete a marathon or triathlon, cycle through Italy, learn to Scuba Dive or inline skate or rock-climb, cycle the Oregon coast, or would you just be happy with working out 4x/week consistently? What are you health and fitness wishes? The only rule with this wish list is that none of your goals can be related to your body size, shape or weight. Stay away from listing a goal such as losing 10 pounds or 4 inches off your hips. Let\\'s keep this list positive, action- oriented, and focused away from body image.\\n\\nMany people take this approach – ‘As soon as I get fit, then I’ll start doing the things I’ve always wanted to do.” We take the opposite approach. Let’s set the goal and in the process of training for the event or activity you’ve always wanted to do, then you will get in great shape! It puts purpose to your workouts. And it’s such a positive, motivating focus. For example, let’s say a client sets a goal of finishing a 10km fun run. Setting this kind of goal, because it has a deadline, provides a compelling reason to stick to the program and not miss workouts. In contrast, if the goal is to lose 10 pounds in 2 months, if the client gets off track, they can negotiate with themselves and say, “Well, I guess I can wait an additional week or two to achieve my goals.” But if they get off track with their training program while preparing for an event, they can’t call the event organizer and ask them to postpone the event because they aren’t going to be ready. A client knows that every workout or skipped workout will either positively or negatively affect their performance and their ability to achieve their goal. In addition, once he/she crosses the finish line, that’s something no one can ever take away from them. They will always have their medal, t-shirt, and photos crossing the finish line. Whereas, with weight loss, someone could lose the weight and then gain it all back next month and feel like a failure. Plus there is a lot of status associated with conquering a tough challenge or finishing a event, so a person’s self esteem receives a huge boost providing them with the belief that they can achieve the next goal. We have also found when someone succeeds at a goal such as this, they then inherently look towards the next goal – it’s just human nature. So they decide to attempt a half marathon, full marathon, a challenging hike, triathlon, etc. It’s a positive spiral. Whereas, with weight loss, it’s often a negative spiral. They lose the 10 pounds but they are still not happy. They then desire to lose another 5 pounds and get rid of this fat and so on. Some people who have the most ‘perfect’ bodies are those that struggle with their body image the most! For all these reasons, we try to keep the focus away from Body Image and instead focus on behaviors, events and actions.\\n\\n16\\n\\nSMART Goal Setting\\n\\nSetting realistic goals is the key to success. It is not enough to say, \"I want to get into shape\". Effective and realistic goals are Specific, Measurable, Attainable, Reward-based and have a Time frame. All your goals must be clear, easy to measure, and have a deadline. But don\\'t stop there. Successful goal setting requires two more things. Be prepared to reassess and reevaluate your goals on a regular basis and reward yourself once you have achieved a goal. For example, treat yourself to a massage, a new outfit or a trip. Then set your sights on the next goal.\\n\\nSometimes, when starting an exercise or nutrition program, we can get overzealous and decide to change a million things all at once. It soon becomes clear that you have taken on too much and it becomes almost impossible to succeed at anything. To avoid this, you need to determine what is most important to you and focus on these areas first.\\n\\nFinally, if you are undertaking a major lifestyle change, the big picture may be a bit overwhelming. Take the big goal and split it into small, easily achievable goals. This is realistic. It will help you succeed on a regular basis and that will give you the momentum you need to reach the ultimate goal.\\n\\nRecord your top one to two goals and break them down into smaller goals and action steps.\\n\\nSMART Goal #1 =\\n\\nAction Step #1\\n\\nAction Step #2\\n\\nAction Step #3\\n\\nAction Step #4\\n\\nAction Step #5\\n\\nSMART Goal #2 =\\n\\nAction Step #1\\n\\nAction Step #2\\n\\nAction Step #3\\n\\nAction Step #4\\n\\nAction Step #5\\n\\n17\\n\\nObstacles and Strategies\\n\\nWhat went wrong last time? You have most likely tried to stick to an exercise program before. Most people have. They try over and over again. Something like a New Year\\'s resolution, summer, a wedding or a reunion motivates them to try again. Eventually, they fail because they basically mimic exactly what they did last time. This represents the definition for insanity – doing the same thing over and over again but expecting a different result. Whatever forced you off track last time will more than likely surface again.\\n\\nThis time, things are going to be different. This time you are going to be prepared. We are going to develop a strategy for overcoming roadblocks posed by work, kids, fatigue, or lack of time. We are going to determine how you are going to balance it all.\\n\\nOutline any obstacles that have surfaced in the past or that you expect will surface in the future. Once you have outlined the potential obstacles, then you can determine your strategies for overcoming them. You will be prepared - no surprises! Plus, we here to help you get past those obstacles!\\n\\nNote: If you have been adhering to a consistent exercise and nutrition program for six or more months, you can skip this assignment (unless you need to strategize for any upcoming obstacles).\\n\\nObstacle\\n\\nStrategy (you may find it necessary to outline numerous strategies for any potential obstacle)\\n\\n1.\\n\\n2.\\n\\n3.\\n\\n4.\\n\\n5.\\n\\n6.\\n\\n18\\n\\nMissing a Workout is much more than just Missing a Workout\\n\\nConsider how much discipline it takes to workout three to five days a week. Think about how hard it is to keep stretching beyond our comfort zones and how challenging it is to exercise at high intensities. Consider the self-resolve required to eat healthy foods and drink lots of water every day when temptations surround us everywhere we go. But if you have the courage to respect your body – the temple that houses your mind and spirit – personal mastery will not be far away. It says a lot about who you are as a person when you invest the time to take care of yourself. It says you respect and love yourself enough to do the things necessary for you to be at your personal best. Each time you get into the gym for a workout on a day when you just don’t feel like exercising, you grow a little stronger as a human being. Each time you go for a run or walk on a cold winter’s day when you just feel like staying under the warm, cozy covers, you strengthen your character. When you endure a tough workout, it enables you to persevere through any other challenge in your life. Working on improving your physical conditioning will not only enrich your life and make you a better person, you’ll also become a better parent, a better spouse, a better and more productive worker, and a better friend.\\n\\nExercising regularly, eating well and taking the time to relax and nourish your body will make you feel happier. It will provide you with more energy than you have ever known. It will give you greater stamina and mental toughness and make you a clearer, stronger thinker. It will make you more patient and loving. There are 168 hours in a week. Surely each and every one of us, regardless of our hectic schedules, can carve out three to five of them to care for our bodies and work on mastering our physical state.\\n\\nYou must remember that a missed workout is much more than just a missed workout! When you miss a workout, you don’t just stay at the same level you were at – you actually take a few steps back. Every time you miss a workout, you have done something to strengthen the habit of not working out. When you’ve made the promise to yourself to exercise so many times per week and then you break that promise, you start to lose trust in yourself. With each missed workout, you start to lose self-confidence and begin to question whether you can actually stick with it at all. A missed workout fuels self-doubt and makes that negative habit stronger. Miss enough workouts, and eventually that negative habit of not working out will replace the positive habit of exercising that you have worked so hard to cultivate. Every time you fail to do the right thing, you fuel the habit of doing the wrong thing. So the next time you’re trying to justify pressing the snooze button and skipping your workout, or working through lunch instead of taking a walk break or heading right home after work instead of stopping at the gym, just don’t do it. Don’t even think about it. Don’t even allow yourself the opportunity to talk yourself out of doing what you know you need to do to be at your best. Just remember that you’ll feel like a million bucks once you’re done. The real challenge for most people is not the workout itself, but actually overcoming the negative thoughts that try to sabotage very good intentions.\\n\\n“The greatest irony of our physical life is that when we are young, we are willing to sacrifice every bit of our health for wealth, and when we grow old, we are willing to sacrifice so much of our wealth for just one day of health.” Don’t let this happen to you. The little things in life are actually the big things and the quality of success that you will experience in your life ultimately depends upon the tiny choices you make every minute of every hour of every day. It’s the small daily acts and habits that define how big we end up living.\\n\\nLooking Good, Feeling Great & Living Life to the Fullest!\\n\\nAdapted from Robin Sharma’s ‘Family Wisdom’ plus a little bit of our own wisdom.\\n\\n19\\n\\nOvercoming Excuses\\n\\nStarting and sticking to an exercise or nutrition program takes a lot of discipline. Here are the most common stumbling blocks to exercise and healthy eating that you may experience and healthy ways to overcome them. Sometimes, even when we have good intensions and want to do the right thing, it can slip us up if we have the wrong attitude about it. Do you see yourself in any of the following scenarios?\\n\\nNote: If you have been adhering to a consistent exercise and nutrition program for six or more months, feel free to skip to the next section.\\n\\nI don\\'t have enough time. If you have trouble finding time to exercise, you are not alone. A perceived lack of time is one of the most common excuses for not starting or for quitting an exercise program. But it really does not wash. We have clients who manage large businesses, clients with 6-8 children and clients who seem to do it all. How do they do it? They make health and fitness a priority in their life. When life gets rough, exercise is usually the first thing to go when, in fact, it should be the last. Exercise is the glue to mental sanity when life becomes chaotic.\\n\\nSomehow, when others need you, your needs tend to end up on the back burner. Someone at work asks you to complete a project, your spouse needs your attention, the kids need some quality time, your friends are asking you why you have not called, and you have a to-do list that extends well into the next 6 months. You can see how easy it is to convince yourself that the morning workout can wait until lunch and then until after dinner. Or maybe tomorrow and finally, \"I\\'ll get back on track next month!\" Commitments, responsibilities and the demands of work, family, and social life are always going to be there. When you allow yourself to put your own needs second to everything and everyone else, you will end up the loser.\\n\\nResearch, in fact, shows that people who exercise are more productive at whatever they are doing. Translation: You will be able to do more when you are in good shape. As for believing exercise is a huge time commitment, even 10-30 minutes a day, if done consistently, can result in health benefits.\\n\\nMake an appointment with yourself, just as you would for your doctor or dentist or a meeting with your boss. That way, when someone asks if you can meet at 5 o\\'clock, you can honestly say, \"Sorry, I\\'ve got an appointment. How about at 4:00?\" Scheduling fitness into your life is why personal trainers have become so popular. Now you are accountable to your trainer as well as yourself.\\n\\nStop putting it off! \"I\\'ll start exercising right after New Year\\'s…in the spring…right after I\\'m finished with this huge project…once the kids get older…once the kids leave home…after I\\'ve retired…Now is the time to start because there will always be things competing for your time. You can choose to make exercise a priority in your life now or wait until you\\'re forced to make it a priority. People who cannot find the time to exercise are often forced to find the time for illness. We take our health for granted until we get sick. People who swear they do not have a minute to exercise, then find themselves hospitalized for bypass surgery and out of commission for weeks, soon recognize that the extra time taken to exercise would haven been well worth it! The message is clear. Unless you take care of yourself now, one day you may find yourself unable to take care of your business, family, or any of your other interests.\\n\\nAnother helpful strategy for overcoming the time obstacle is to sit down and record how you spend your time in a typical day. Then go through the list and identify any time wasters. It could be the television or computer or perhaps there are constant interruptions at work. Now determine how you could eliminate some of these time wasters. For example, at work, make it known that from 10:00 until noon you are not to be interrupted so you can focus on some important projects. You will find that you do have time to exercise – you just need to restructure your schedule to make sure you have time for the\\n\\n20\\n\\nI have no energy: Those who exercise regularly know from experience that exercise actually leaves you with more energy! Some helpful strategies for overcoming this obstacle are to schedule exercise when you are less likely to feel exhausted from a long day at work or with the kids. Get up 45 minutes earlier than everyone else and go for a walk. It will start your day off on a positive note. Keep your fitness gear in the car so that on the way home you can stop at the gym for your workout. If you go home first, the couch and TV may be too tempting after a long day at work. Or if you do find yourself skipping out on your workouts because you\\'ve got no energy, schedule in with a trainer or a friend. Whether you are tired or not, you still have to be there because they are waiting for you.\\n\\nI\\'m too old to start exercising: No, you are too old not to exercise! A 30 year-old sedentary individual will suffer from a 10 percent decrease in muscle mass and aerobic capacity and a reduction in flexibility each decade. Bone density deterioration starts at age 35. By the time you are 68, you will have experienced an 80 percent decrease in strength. By age 80, an individual will have lost half of their muscle mass. The good news is that if you exercise, these statistics will improve dramatically. Even people as old as 90 have experienced the positive benefits of exercise, so it is never too late to get started. It doesn\\'t have to be intense, but you do need to start doing something!\\n\\nI hate exercise: In the beginning, exercise may feel like a chore, but eventually it will become a physical and mental health need. It is important to find activities you enjoy doing so that you will participate in them regularly, see the results, and get hooked. Use music, try hiking or walking, and add variety to your program to make it more fun. Exercise with friends. Studies show you tend to achieve better results that way because it will become more difficult to skip workouts. There is also no evidence to suggest that exercise needs to be painful. If it hurts that much, you may be doing too much, too soon. While exercising, you may feel some discomfort, muscular fatigue, or a burning sensation near the end of a set or an exercise bout. These feelings are normal. However, while performing an exercise, you should not feel sharp pain. This is not normal and you should stop the exercise immediately and consult a sports physician or physiotherapist. All of us have experienced muscle soreness after a new activity or highly intense workout. Remember the feeling after your first day of skiing, first aerobics class, or the first run of the summer? This sensation is referred to as delayed onset muscle soreness because it usually takes one to three days after the workout for the stiffness to surface. Many participants rate the effectiveness of a workout by how sore they are afterwards, but it you are training appropriately, there is no need to be that sore. It is okay to think \"Hey, my muscles feel like they had a great workout yesterday.\" However, if you have a problem getting out of a chair, walking, or even just moving, you are training too hard - and not very sensibly. To reduce the likelihood of extreme muscle soreness from training sessions, always warm up, cool down, stretch, and progress slowly. Once you have established a consistent exercise routine, there are no extra health benefits from pushing yourself to be extremely sore. Remember – pain is a warning signal that your body has done too much too soon. When you experience extreme muscle soreness or pain, back off on the intensity of your program and progress more slowly. \"No pain, no gain\" is a myth. Pain is not necessary to improve your fitness and get results.\\n\\nI\\'m too out of shape to exercise: One survey found the top reason why people choose not to join a gym is because they want to get into better shape or lose weight first. This backwards approach may never get you to your goals! At NW Women’s Fitness Club, we have worked hard to create an environment that is friendly, non-intimidating and comfortable. We’ll get you through these initial awkward feelings.\\n\\nThe gym scene is not my thing: Sorry, this will not wash. There are literally hundreds of things you can do at home to get in shape. We can come to your house and design a customized program for you.\\n\\n21\\n\\nMy knees hurt so I can\\'t exercise: The health benefits of exercise often outweigh the risks. Certain conditions may make exercise more difficult but you can work around most problems. We will work with your physician, physical therapist or health practitioner to design a program to strengthen your weaknesses. Plus, if you do have knee problems, there is no reason why you can\\'t work on your upper body and abdominals while you rehabilitate your knees.\\n\\nI can\\'t see any results: One of the biggest hurdles new exercisers face is that the effort often does not match the result. They have been exercising religiously for five weeks and jump up on the scale. Ugh, no change! They feel the program must not be working and give up. Unrealistic expectations can be a real downer. Avoid measuring your success just by the scale. Instead measure the improvement to your energy levels, monitor how many more reps you can do of a particular exercise or keep track of how many more minutes you can do of a given activity. You may be making more progress than you think.\\n\\nAll or Nothing: You are scheduled for a 90 minute workout but something comes up and you cannot get to the gym for the allocated time. You scrap the workout and decide you will try to fit it in tomorrow. You have decided to eat healthier but one day you slip a bit at lunch and have a chocolate bar. You decide that since you have already failed for the day, you might as well throw in the towel and indulge in a few cookies, a bowl of ice cream, and a bag of chips. Tomorrow is another day. Can you see how this \"all or nothing\" approach works against you? Wouldn\\'t a 30 minute workout have been better than no exercise as all? Wouldn\\'t a single chocolate bar have been better than an all-out binge? Sometimes, striving for perfection is what leads to failure. The trick in trying to stick to a long-term plan is to learn to compromise. When it comes to nutrition, for example, focus on the 80/20 rule – 80 percent of the time you eat really well and 20 percent of the time you indulge a little. No going overboard, though. When it comes to exercise, remember that any activity is better than nothing.\\n\\nLet\\'s Go Back Home: Imagine this scenario. You have scheduled a two-week vacation and have decided to drive to your favorite holiday destination. You get half way there, get a flat tire and turn around and go back home. Sounds ridiculous, doesn\\'t it? But this is exactly what happens when most people start exercise or nutrition programs. They are on their way to their goals and they slip up. Instead of \"fixing the flat\" and continuing on toward their goal, they give up and return to old habits and patterns. We know that 70 percent of people who start an exercise program drop out within a matter of months, and most people who lose 10 pounds gain them back. So how do you avoid these set-backs? It is important to accept that there are going to be obstacles, challenges or perceived failures along the way to any goal. No one is perfect! Those who succeed learn from the challenge and get right back on track.\\n\\nThe Here and Now: So many of us fall prey to the lure of immediate gratification. The chocolate cake staring us in the face is too great a temptation compared to future weight loss. We would rather experience the pleasure now and worry about the consequences later. A binge today simply means tomorrow we will eat better or we will work out twice as long or hard. There is always a way to justify a lack of discipline. Discipline and will-power are perceived as deprivation - we are sacrificing or losing something. But if you can imagine that each time you work out, stick to a nutritional plan or decide not to indulge in a less-healthy choice, you are actually giving yourself something – spiritually, emotionally, and physically. Sticking to an exercise or nutrition plan is the same as practicing discipline when your kids are misbehaving. As parents, they would like to scream, shout and lose it but instead we count to 10 and choose our words more carefully. There is no doubt that practicing this type of discipline makes you feel better about yourself. It is the same with exercise. Your body deserves to be treated well. You deserve to eat well and exercise regularly. Many athletes think of their body as a temple and so should you. Think of that the next time you notice yourself grabbing for a piece of cake a little too often. Push it away and think of it as actually giving something to yourself rather than taking something away.\\n\\n22\\n\\nSECTION THREE\\n\\nCARDIOVASCULAR EXERCISE\\n\\n“High on the wall,\\n\\nin the castle of your dreams of success,\\n\\nhangs the picture of what you want to be.\\n\\nAlways keep that picture hanging there.\\n\\nSee yourself where you intend to be.\\n\\nNight and day dream of what you intend to do\\n\\nand what you intend to be,\\n\\nfor your dreams interpret your intentions always.\\n\\nAll successes are, at first, dreams.”\\n\\n23\\n\\n24\\n\\nBenefits of Cardiovascular Exercise:\\n\\n\\uf020 \\uf0b7\\uf020 \\uf0b7\\uf020 Burns fat and calories directly Improves body composition \\uf0b7\\uf020 Increases bone density \\uf0b7\\uf020 \\uf0b7\\uf020 Reduces risk for coronary artery disease \\uf0b7\\uf020 Enhances sleep quality Improves posture \\uf0b7\\uf020 Improves functional ability \\uf0b7\\uf020 \\uf0b7\\uf020 Enhances self-esteem \\uf0b7\\uf020 Reduces episodes of depression\\n\\nIncreases aerobic capacity Improves energy levels and provides a natural high\\n\\nHere are some definitions that you should be aware of:\\n\\nCardiovascular Exercise: This refers to exercise that conditions your heart and respiratory systems. It typically includes Aerobic and Anaerobic exercise.\\n\\nAerobic exercise is exercise that demands a level of oxygen intake that your body is able to supply (for extended periods). It involves activities such as going out for a walk, jog, cycle, swim, or taking a fitness class. It is exercise that is within your comfort zone and at an intensity that you could hold for 20 minutes plus. This type of exercise will condition your heart and achieve the benefits listed above.\\n\\nAnaerobic exercise is exercise that demands a level of oxygen intake that your body is unable to adequately supply (for extended periods). It is a more challenging form of exercise. It involves the same activities as above but at a much harder intensity. For example, it would involve going for a jog and then for 30 seconds picking up the pace and sprinting. Then you would return back to an easier intensity at the end of the 30 second sprint. You could do this at regular intervals during a running, cycling, swimming, or walking workout. This kind of workout will help you get fit fast. It raises what is called your \"anaerobic threshold\". This threshold point is the feeling you\\'ll experience during an activity session when you\\'re pushing hard, perhaps a bit too hard, and you start to breathe really heavy and your heart is pounding fast and if you maintain this intensity for too long, you might start to feel nauseous and dizzy. This is one of the side effects of lactic acid - a toxic by-product of high intensity exercise. When you perform anaerobic intervals as listed above, you only hold this pace for 30 seconds to two minutes, and just before you\\'re about to start experiencing some of those nasty side effects of high intensity exercise, you drop the pace again and allow your body to recover. By doing these brief, high- intensity intervals your body starts to get used to the intensity and is better able to handle the lactic acid, flush it out of the tissues and actually use the lactic acid for energy. So by doing these anaerobic intervals, you will get fit fast and you\\'ll start to notice that intensities that used to get you huffing and puffing aren\\'t that challenging anymore. This form of interval conditioning will also expend more calories per minute and help you achieve any fat loss goals you may have.\\n\\nJust a note - Wait a few months before graduating to high-intensity exercise if you are a beginner. Of course, the faster you walk, step, dance, cycle, or run, the more calories you use per minute. However, if you have been sedentary, high-intensity exercise compromises the ability to sustain exercise for a long time. For that reason, lower-intensity exercise is more effective in the initial stages of training and is a prerequisite to higher calorie burning, higher intensity exercise. In fact, you will experience great results by just getting started on a program. You do not want to start your program by dreading each exercise session because you know it is going to hurt --that will make it difficult to stay motivated.\\n\\n25\\n\\nThree easy walks a week on an ongoing basis is far better than one hard run every once in a while. Remember, consistency is the key to getting results. You are going to eventually want to intensify your program, but you want to progress to this level slowly. In the beginning, start by just incorporating two months of easy training with a slow, gradual progression of volume. Do not worry about intensity – just work on increasing the amount of time you spend exercising.\\n\\nVariable impact refers to exposing your body to a bit of impact here and there, and is important because in order to maintain muscle mass and bone density, you need to add a little bit of stress onto the bone. You may have heard many people complain that high-impact exercise really bothers their joints, specifically back, knees, or feet. For a lot of people, high-impact activity may not be the activity of choice; however, in your program you will want to ensure that you do expose your muscles and bones to a bit of impact. For example, if you\\'re a swimmer, your body weight is supported by the water, so you\\'ll want to complement this with an activity like walking. Swimming is a great activity, but recent studies have shown that it is not as beneficial for bone density as medium-impact (walking) or high-impact activities (volleyball). Even though swimming is better than no exercise, it should be augmented with strength training or a type of activity that will provide a bit more impact i.e.. walking, fitness classes, etc. Or if you\\'d like to try jogging, stick to a walk/run program where you may start with walking for four minutes and running for only one minute at a time. This will be sufficient to provide the positive results we\\'re looking for.\\n\\nCardiovascular Prescription:\\n\\nThe Surgeon General’s Report released in 1996 suggests that 30 minutes of light activity every day (equivalent to household chores, walking, gardening, cycling) will be sufficient to improve someone\\'s health. This is a non-structured way of attempting to improve your health. All you have to do is commit to being more active in your life. Just try to get in 30 minutes of activity every day.\\n\\nIf your goals are more aggressive and you really desire to improve your overall fitness, your prescription will require a higher level of volume and intensity. Here are some guidelines:\\n\\nThe American College of Sports Medicine (ACSM) recommends 3-5 days/week of 20-60 minutes of cardiovascular activity to maximize fitness. They recommend 5-7 days/week to maximize fat loss. We are also big fans of doing something active everyday. That way you don’t have to ask yourself if you should exercise today. It is assumed that you will do something active everyday – it becomes part of your everyday lifestyle. Instead of asking ‘if’, you’ll ask ‘what’. We’re not suggesting that you workout hard everyday, but just do something active --even if it’s going for a short, easy walk on your lunch or after dinner.\\n\\nIf your goal is fat loss, it is suggested that each aerobic session should expend at least 300 calories minimum (of course, anything is better than nothing). Your own personal heart rate monitor will help you measure calories burned during each workout, but to give you an idea, 300 calories would be equivalent to approximately 32 minutes of stepping or a high intensity fitness class, three miles of running, or 4-5 miles of walking.\\n\\nThe actual type of aerobic activity must be continuous in nature and involve your large muscle groups. Some of the best choices are as follows:\\n\\nWalking Rowing\\n\\nRunning Racquet\\n\\nCycling Stairclimbing Fitness Classes X-Country skiing\\n\\nSwimming\\n\\nInline Skating Hiking\\n\\n26\\n\\nChoosing an Aerobic Activity:\\n\\nThe most important consideration when deciding which activity will be your primary activity of choice is deciding which of the above activities interest you the most and that you really believe you could do on an ongoing basis. The best activity in the world is the one you actually do regularly. If we told you that running was the best way to get in shape but you hated running, you probably would not stick to the program very well and would probably experience very limited results. So, you really need to examine your interests. For example, if you prefer to exercise outside, running through trails or hiking may be your answer. If you prefer indoors, you might enjoy the energy of fitness classes or working out on a stairclimber so you can be distracted by a magazine or TV. If you like to exercise in groups, fitness classes or a walking clinic may help you stick to your program. If you are a solo exerciser, your own individualized program may offer the solitude you are looking for. It is important to determine the perfect- fit, custom-designed program that will facilitate your efforts. Here are some questions to help you design a program that is going to work for you.\\n\\nHow many days per week can your schedule accommodate exercise? _______ How much time do you want to commit during each exercise session? _______ Which days are best to exercise? Which days are best to rest? Do you like to exercise in the morning, at lunch, after work or evening? _______ Do you like to exercise alone, with a friend, in a group or a combination? ______\\n\\nM T W TH F S Sun M T W TH F S Sun\\n\\nConsideration: When determining when you will exercise, consider that working out first thing in the morning definitely has advantages. One theory is that an early morning workout will jump-start your metabolism and get you revving at a higher level all day long. In addition (and probably more importantly), many people find if they workout first thing and get it out of the way, there are fewer chances for life responsibilities to distract them away from their exercise ambitions. And finally, an early morning workout sets the tone for the entire day. You already have one success under your belt and thus, may find it easier to make healthier choices at lunch or pass on the donut break mid-afternoon. However, keep in mind that exercise at any time of the day is best. For example, many working moms prefer to exercise on their lunch- breaks so they can get home after work and be with their kids. So if you have tried early morning exercise and it did not work for you, don\\'t worry. You will accomplish your goals regardless of the time of day you exercise.\\n\\nWhen deciding whether an activity is the right one for you ask yourself some of the following questions: \\uf0b7\\uf020 Do I find the activity pleasurable? Do I like it? Is it a lot of fun? Does it make me happy? \\uf0b7\\uf020 Am I interested in the activity? Is it stimulating? \\uf0b7\\uf020 Do I get absorbed in the activity? \\uf0b7\\uf020 Do I feel energized during or after the activity? Is it invigorating? Is it refreshing? \\uf0b7\\uf020 Does the activity give me a sense of accomplishment? Is it gratifying?\\n\\nIf you answered yes to all these questions, you\\'ve made a good choice. If you\\'ve answered no to these questions and you find the activity unpleasant, boring, frustrating, and you hate every second of it, you should reconsider your choice and search for an activity that will provide you with more enjoyment.\\n\\nRemember that consistency is the primary key to achieving your exercise goals. Find an activity you enjoy and you will be more motivated to participate, stick with it more consistently and reap the benefits more quickly! Find which activity sparks your interest and soon you will also enjoy a fit and healthier body!\\n\\n27\\n\\nFine-tuning Tips:\\n\\nBefore we move on, let’s examine the following considerations. We know that in order to maximize caloric expenditure, we need to maximize the amount of oxygen we are consuming. We utilize more oxygen when we involve more muscle mass. So any activities that involve more muscle mass will make burning calories and body fat easier. So if your goal is to maximize fat loss, consider these points: \\uf0b7\\uf020 At least one or two of your primary aerobic activities should involve activities during which you stand to perform them like running, power walking, fitness classes, cross-country skiing or stair-climbing. If your muscles have to support you in an upright position, they must expend more energy to do so in comparison to a seated, body-weight supported position.\\n\\n\\uf020 At least one of your primary aerobic activities should involve both your arms and your legs. Activities like rowing or cross-country skiing, which involve vigorous activity from both your arms and your legs, will expend a lot of energy. Of course, cross country skiing which occurs in an upright position and involves both your arms and your legs will be a higher calorie burner than rowing.\\n\\n\\uf020 Consider the environment in which you exercise. Your heat regulator and your appetite are both\\n\\ncontrolled by your hypothalmus. So, if you are exercising in a colder environment, like a pool during a swim workout, your hypothalmus must act in order to maintain your core temperature. As it responds to the colder environment, it also acts to stimulate your appetite. This explains why many athletes find they may start a run hungry but once they are finished, it may take them an hour or more before they are ready to eat. In contrast, many athletes have difficulty explaining why, after a swim workout or a long- easy hike, they are famished. This effect makes it more difficult to lose fat with swimming. This is why elite level swimmers still carry on average 5% more body fat than elite level runners. We are definitely not suggesting that you find the hottest environment to perform your workouts – which would pose its own health risks. We are also not suggesting that swimming does not burn fat – it is just not as efficient as, say, running. Swimming has many advantages for overweight individuals; their bodies do not overheat, so the workout feels more comfortable; the buoyancy factor makes it a lot easier on the joints; and they can definitely improve their cardiovascular and musculo-skeletal systems. Just be sure that not all your primary workouts consist of activities like swimming, outdoor cycling and easy hiking which all take place in a colder environment. Instead include at least one activity during which you will sweat and raise your body core temperature.\\n\\nDesigning Your Weekly Cardiovascular Program:\\n\\nYour Personal Trainer will help customize your cardiovascular training program. Here are the principles and rationale we will use when designing your weekly structure.\\n\\n1. Structure 1-2 short and intense interval workouts into your program each week. These workouts should last for approximately 20 minutes and should involve a Rating of Perceived Exertion (RPE) intensity of approximately 8 (we’ll discuss RPE at the end of this section). During these workouts you will notice that your breathing is heavier and you will definitely be able to feel your heart beating more quickly. These workouts will definitely be above your comfort zone or where you would prefer to exercise.\\n\\n2. Structure 1-2 moderate length and intensity aerobic workouts each week. These sessions should\\n\\ninvolve a 30-40 minute duration and an RPE effort level of 6-7. This is the intensity zone where most people will train so this will feel comfortable. Most people neglect training in the extreme zones - the very easy and the very challenging.\\n\\n3. Structure 2-3 long and easy intensity workouts each week. These sessions should be 45 minutes plus in duration and involve an RPE intensity of 5. These workouts will feel very comfortable. You may even feel like you are going too slow – you are not! Workouts in this zone are not very stressful on your system but will effectively target your aerobic energy system and help to develop fat burning enzymes. This intensity zone is also recommended if you are just getting started into exercise. The other zones may be too stressful and uncomfortable for you at this point.\\n\\n28\\n\\n4. Include a 6-12 minute low intensity warm-up and cool-down. The body does not respond very well\\n\\ngoing from inactivity to very intense activity. The cardio-vascular, musculo-skeletal, neurological and metabolic energy pathways need to be gradually stimulated in order to perform at an optimal level. Muscles that are warm have a much better ability to extract and utilize oxygen to produce energy. As muscles warm up, the enzyme activity level is increased. This means that fats and sugars are broken down more rapidly, and more energy and less lactic acid (the burning sensation) will be produced. This will of course, enhance your performance and increase your ability to burn fat! Your body also does not respond very well going from intense activity to complete rest. Your heart, lungs, muscles, joints, and energy systems require a gradual cool-down to avoid blood pooling in the lower extremities, dizziness and to assist in the recovery process. Warming up and cooling down is a healthy way to exercise anyways but in addition, it is a way to prolong your caloric burn for each workout. So, for example, if you are going to go for a run, start and finish with a 6 minute walk. A warm-up and cool-down should generally involve the same workout activity but at a much lower intensity.\\n\\n5. Working out indoors? Use a variety of machines. If you are using indoor cardiovascular machines, try staying on the same machine for a maximum of 15 minutes. This will create better muscle balance. We would rather see someone spend 10 minutes on the stairmaster, rowing machine, treadmill and ski- machine than spend 40 minutes just on the stairmaster. If you are using the same machine or activity all the time, the muscles targeted with this exercise will continue to get fitter but the other neglected muscles will get weaker and muscle imbalances are sure to surface. This method of training will develop a more overall toned physique and reduce your risk for injury. And finally, mixing up your indoor machines will also help to prevent boredom. If you\\'re working out at home and only have one indoor machine, perhaps mix up your program. For example, you could start by walking on the treadmill for 15 minutes. Then get off the machine for a few minutes and skip or step up and down onto a step. Then get back onto the treadmill to finish off your workout.\\n\\n6. Structure at least 1-2 recovery days into your weekly exercise program. Remember this, muscle tissue does not grow stronger during exercise. In fact, muscle breaks down during exercise! It needs a period of recovery to repair, grow, develop and get stronger. Back-to-back hard workouts means that the muscles never get a chance to fully recover. Incorporating one to two recovery days into your workout week will ensure your body gets a chance to heal. Do not think, though, that you need to stay home, chained to your couch and TV! When we say recovery, we mean, that maybe you go for an easy stroll or hike or cycle but you are not concerned about getting into your training zone. Just relax and enjoy moving your body at a nice, easy pace.\\n\\nLow intensity versus high intensity:\\n\\nA number of years ago, you may remember many fitness professionals prescribing lower intensity activity to maximize fat loss. Many fit people lowered the intensity of their workouts fearful that they were not burning fat. Unfortunately, they were misled and many people still believe that low intensity activity is the best way to maximize fat loss. The reality is that the activity that expends the most amount of calories will lead to the most amount of fat burned.\\n\\nYes, during lower intensity activity you will burn a higher percentage of fat and during higher intensity activity you will burn a higher percentage of carbohydrates or sugars. But the important point to note is that during low intensity activity you are burning fat at a higher percentage of a lower amount of calories. When you exercise at a lower intensity you are definitely expending less calories. The selective use of fat as a fuel, specifically at lower intensities, does not translate into greater fat loss, regardless of how tempting it is to draw this conclusion. The more important focus with regard to calories expended, is not the percentage of energy coming from fat, but rather the total volume of fat used and the total number of calories expended. Let’s look at the math.\\n\\n29\\n\\nAt 60% max heart rate (easier intensity) \\uf0b7\\uf020 Approximately 50% of calories come from fat (50% from sugars) \\uf0b7\\uf020 Approximately 8 kcal/min are expended \\uf0b7\\uf020 60 minutes x 8 kcal/min = 480 total calories \\uf0b7\\uf020 50% x 480 kcal = 240 fat calories\\n\\nAt 80% max heart rate (more vigorous intensity) \\uf0b7\\uf020 Approximately 40% of calories come from fat (60% from sugars) \\uf0b7\\uf020 Approximately 11 kcal/min are expended \\uf0b7\\uf020 60 minutes x 11 kcal/min = 640 total calories \\uf0b7\\uf020 40% x 640 kcal = 264 fat calories\\n\\nFrom these figures you can see how fitness leaders could have been misled. If you were to examine only the first line, the percentage of fat being burned as fuel, you would definitely prescribe lower intensity activity. However, if you examine the whole picture, it is clear that higher intensity activity definitely expends more calories and also more fat. Here is some more statistics to convince you.\\n\\nIt takes approximately 3,500 calories to burn one pound of fat. Compare the following exercise programs.\\n\\nProgram A – Easier intensity (approximately 5kcal/min) – For example, easy walking \\uf0b7\\uf020 30 minutes of activity 3x/week \\uf0b7\\uf020 150kcal/session x 3x/week \\uf0b7\\uf020 450kcal/week \\uf0b7\\uf020\\n\\nIt would take 8 weeks to burn 1 pound of fat\\n\\nProgram B – Same intensity as above but for a longer duration \\uf0b7\\uf020 60 minutes of activity 3x/week \\uf0b7\\uf020 300kcal/session x 3x/week \\uf0b7\\uf020 900 kcal expended per week \\uf0b7\\uf020\\n\\nIt would take 4 weeks to burn 1 pound of fat\\n\\nProgram C – More vigorous intensity (approximately 10 kcal/min) – For example, jogging or power walking up and down hills \\uf0b7\\uf020 60 minutes of activity 3x/week \\uf0b7\\uf020 600kcal/session x 3x/week \\uf0b7\\uf020 1800 kcal expended per week \\uf0b7\\uf020\\n\\nIt would take 2 weeks to burn 1 pound of fat\\n\\nIf you followed Program A, it would take you eight weeks to burn one pound of fat! Most people would give up by then. If you could easily handle the higher intensity of Program C, wouldn\\'t you prefer to just wait 2 weeks to burn off that pound of fat deposited around your waist, hips or thighs? Remember though, if you can\\'t handle the higher intensity of Program C, follow Program B which means you can maintain the easier intensity but you just have to go longer.\\n\\nTime is definitely an issue for a lot of exercisers and most don\\'t want to spend hours in the gym if they can get the same results in a shorter period of time. Consider this. At 60% of your max heart rate, it would take you approximately 40 minutes to burn off 300 kcal. If you could handle a higher intensity and were able to exercise at 80% of your max heart rate, it would only take you approximately 27 minutes to burn the same 300 kcal. If time is a factor and you do not have a lot of time to waste, would you rather exercise for 40 or 27 minutes and still burn the same amount of calories?\\n\\n30\\n\\nIf we have not convinced you yet, consider this. Did you know that the highest percentage of fat that you burn during any activity is during rest! At rest, you are using approximately 50% fat as your fuel – that is the highest % of fat you can burn – you are never burning 100% fat. That\\'s right, just sitting here reading this manual, you are burning the highest percentage of fat you could possibly burn. That is because your body can only store a limited supply of carbohydrates (sugars) and so during rest, the demand on your body is low and your body wants to spare your precious sugar stores. Since you have an unlimited supply of fat stores, your body would rather burn fat during rest.\\n\\nBut remember that although you are burning a higher percentage of fat at rest, you are expending very few calories (approximately 1kcal/min) so overall you are not burning a lot of fat. If type of fuel utilized was the critical factor for fat loss, then we would be prescribing more rest because this is when we burn the highest percentage of fat as fuel. But it is a higher percentage of a lower number of calories. So, of course, we know it is ridiculous to even consider rest or sleep as a high fat burning activity.\\n\\nOne last note. Examine elite level athletes like sprinters. The majority of their training sessions involve high intensity, sugar-burning activity. But have you ever seen a fat sprinter? Of course not. Although, they are burning a lot of carbohydrates or sugars during their training sessions, they are also expending a lot of calories and a lot of fat. In fact, some sprinters eat over 5000-6000kcal/day without gaining any fat!\\n\\nThe benefits of higher intensity exercise are as follows:\\n\\n\\uf020 Expends more calories per minute \\uf0b7\\uf020 More efficient – burns more calories in less time \\uf0b7\\uf020 Most effective method for improving fitness conditioning \\uf0b7\\uf020 Most effective method for raising anaerobic threshold. Your anaerobic threshold is the stage of exercise where you feel very tired and feel the need to either stop or slow down. You may feel dizzy or nauseas if you stay at this level too long. By incorporating higher intensity activity into your exercise workouts, you raise your anaerobic threshold. This means that you can exercise at a higher intensity before you start to experience those uncomfortable sensations.\\n\\n\\uf020 Most effective method for inducing training adaptations. Incorporating this type of training into your program will enable your body to handle the higher intensities more easily. You will find that intensities that used to leave you breathless and fatigued, no longer challenge you anymore. Soon, you will be able to expend more calories per minute compared to when you first started exercise. When people first initiate an exercise program, a comfortable calorie burning level is approximately 5cal/min. Elite athletes can expend more than 20cal/min and sustain it for over 2 hours! As a result, it takes them a lot less time to burn one pound of fat.\\n\\n\\uf020 Most effective method for increasing fat mobilization. This means that as you get fitter, you actually get better at burning fat. Inside of your fat cells, you have enzymes called hormone sensitive lipase and lipoprotein lipase. Hormone sensitive lipase, the \"good guys\", are responsible for releasing fat from a fall cell to be used for energy. Lipoprotein lipase, the \"bad guys\", are responsible for the uptake of fat from the blood stream into fat cells to be stored. Lipoprotein lipase functions to develop our unwanted bulges. If you have lived a sedentary lifestyle and have eaten a poor diet all your life, you will have a lot of the \"bad guys\" and they will be very good at their job. You will have fewer \"good guys\" and they will not be so competent with their responsibilities. The goal is to get more good guys doing their job. But changing the internal chemistry inside of your fat cells may take years. So in the beginning you may not be experiencing results as quickly as you want because you body is actually working against you. But with consistency in your training program, your body will soon start to work for you. Soon you will have increased your ability to mobilize and use fat as a fuel. Training in a high intensity zone will make you fit quick and enable you to enjoy this wonderful training benefit. Soon you will be burning more fat during and after exercise. You will become a fat burning machine!\\n\\n31\\n\\n\\uf020 Experience a higher EPOC (excess post oxygen consumption). Have you ever wondered why you continue to breathe heavy and sweat after your workout is done? Why doesn\\'t your breathing and body temperature go back to normal immediately? After exercise you consume a greater amount of oxygen to assist your body in recovering from the stress of the workout and the demands it placed on your body. It is important to know that EPOC uses fat as its fuel. At higher intensities, your EPOC is greater translating into a greater caloric and fat expenditure post activity. Although the effects of EPOC are small, if you expended an additional 100 calories post exercise as a result of a high intensity exercise session, within 100 workouts (5 months), you would have burned an extra 10,000 calories or 3 pounds of fat! Intervals are the best way to add intensity to a workout by adding brief, high-energy outputs followed by active recovery phases which will avoid fatigue and injury.\\n\\n\\uf020\\n\\nSo, the bottom line is that everyone can benefit for incorporating high intensity training into their program once they have completed the initial level of base conditioning. As we have mentioned, the recommended fitness prescription is one that includes all intensity training zones. That is, sometimes you go easy and long and other times you go hard and fast. This will ensure you train all of your energy systems and minimize overtraining. As a reminder, don’t start with high intensity exercise. Complete a couple months of easier, base conditioning first. And not all of your workouts should be at a high intensity. Mixing it up is the best prescription.\\n\\nBased on all your answers and your understanding of the material in the above section, you can develop a weekly exercise program. Keep in mind, your personal trainer will help you customize this plan and ensure it’s effective and efficient.\\n\\nDesign your own personalized exercise program.\\n\\nPersonal Exercise Program\\n\\nMon\\n\\nTues\\n\\nWed\\n\\nThurs\\n\\nFri\\n\\nSat\\n\\nSun\\n\\nActivity\\n\\nDo not worry about \"making mistakes\" in your program. Just getting you to exercise regularly is all we need to do at this point. We can fine-tune your program as you go along and as we introduce you to some important concepts. But for now, just remember that the best program in the world is the one you do regularly. So just get moving and never stop!\\n\\nReview your program. Does it look realistic? Most people who start an exercise program are initially very excited, motivated and ready to commit to anything! Unfortunately, this may not last long if the goals they have set are unrealistic. So if you believe you can follow this plan, then you can!\\n\\n32\\n\\nMeasuring Intensity\\n\\nMany exercisers question whether they are working too hard or should be breaking more of a sweat. How do you know if you are exercising in the right intensity zones? That is where monitoring your heart rate comes in. Traditionally an intensity of 70 percent of your maximum heart rate was thought to be the ideal. But this one-size-fits-all approach might not provide the best results for everyone. We are finding that a more custom-designed approach is more effective. Here is how to go about it:\\n\\nFirst, you have to determine which of the following zones fits your goals: general health, weight management, aerobic conditioning, advanced conditioning or a combination of all four.\\n\\nZone 1: General Health – A great deal of research indicates that being active at 50 to 60 percent of your maximum heart rate [RPE 4-5], consistently and for a total of 30 minutes on most days, reduces the risk of developing many chronic diseases. Low intensity activities like walking, gardening, household chores or easy cycling will achieve this. If someone does not need to lose body fat and they are not training for a sporting event, this may be all they need to do to stay healthy.\\n\\nZone 2: Weight management – If your goal is to reduce body fat and you have been relatively inactive, you will need to train at a level of 60 to 70 percent of your maximum heart rate [RPE 6]. This is still within your comfort zone and allows you to exercise at a steady pace for a long enough time to burn off a substantial number of calories.\\n\\nZone 3: Aerobic Conditioning/Weight Management – If your goal is to improve your cardio-vascular conditioning for better stamina and endurance, you should train within a zone of 70-80 percent of your maximum heart rate [RPE 7]. This is also a good zone for fat burning if you are already fairly fit. This zone represents a more vigorous level of activity.\\n\\nZone 4/5: Advanced Conditioning – If you are in top shape and training for a sporting event like a 10km race, a triathlon or tennis, you might need to include some workouts that are 80 percent and above your maximum heart rate [RPE 8-9]. This level of training is both physically and mentally demanding so it is not something you would do on a daily basis. And it is not for everyone. Only the really fit should consider working in the range. This zone is also a fat burning zone if you are extremely fit.\\n\\nRemember that ideally, your exercise program will include workouts in each of these ranges – short and hard to long and easy.\\n\\nHere is a formula to help you figure it all out.\\n\\nStep One: Estimate Maximum Heart Rate: This is the maximum number of times your heart can beat in a minute. You can determine your true maximum heart rate in a science lab or you can estimate this figure using this formula.\\n\\nMale: 220 – age = Female: 226 – age =\\n\\nStep Two: Determine Resting Heart Rate: This is your heart rate in beats per minute when you are resting. It is typically your lowest average heart rate. If you take the time to determine your true resting heart rate, your training will be more on target. To determine your true resting heart rate, before you get up in the morning, measure your heart rate for one minute. Be sure to wait a few minutes after the alarm has gone off, so your heart will recover from being startled. Do this 3 days in a row and take the average. This is your resting heart rate.\\n\\n33\\n\\nDetermine your true resting heart rate.\\n\\nDay one:____________ beats per minute Day two:____________ beats per minute Day three:___________ beats per minute\\n\\nAverage resting heart rate = ____________ beats per minutes\\n\\nStep Three: Calculate your Heart Rate Reserve. This is the difference between your maximum heart rate and your resting heart rate - it is the number of beats per minute between your highest and lowest heart rate (MHR—RHR = HRR)\\n\\nComplete this chart and then use the figures to calculate your Heart Rate Training Zones.\\n\\nEstimated Maximum Heart Rate (MHR)\\n\\nTrue Maximum Heart Rate (MHR) This would be calculated in a lab. If you do not have this figure, use the estimated MHR to the left.\\n\\nResting Heart Rate (RHR)\\n\\nHeart Rate Reserve (HRR) MHR - RHR\\n\\nMale: 220 – age = Female: 226 – age =\\n\\nHEART RATE TRAINING ZONES\\n\\nZone 1 - General Health: 50-60% percent of your MHR\\n\\nLower Target Heart Rate Zone = [HRR X 50%] + RHR =\\n\\nUpper Target Heart Rate Zone = [HRR X 60 %] + RHR =\\n\\nZone 2 - Weight Management: 60-70% of your MHR.\\n\\nLower Target Heart Rate Zone = [HRR X 60%] + RHR =\\n\\nUpper Target Heart Rate Zone = [HRR X 70 %] + RHR =\\n\\nZone 3 - Aerobic Conditioning/Weight Management: 70-80% of your MHR.\\n\\nLower Target Heart Rate Zone = [HRR X 70%] + RHR =\\n\\nUpper Target Heart Rate Zone = [HRR X 80 %] + RHR =\\n\\nZone 4 - Advanced Conditioning: 80-90% of your MHR.\\n\\nLower Target Heart Rate Zone = [HRR X 80%] + RHR =\\n\\nUpper Target Heart Rate Zone = [HRR X 90 %] + RHR =\\n\\n34\\n\\nZone 5 - Elite Level Training: 90-100% of your MHR\\n\\nLower Target Heart Rate Zone = [HRR X 90%] + RHR =\\n\\nUpper Target Heart Rate Zone = [HRR X 100 %] + RHR =\\n\\nNote the above age-adjusted maximum heart rate formula is perfect for our purposes. A more accurate method is to actually determine your maximum heart rate in a laboratory setting using a stress test facilitated by a physician or sports physiologist. The tests are generally administered on a treadmill or exercise bicycle and cost anywhere between $100-$300. Assuming you don\\'t want to spend the money on a maximal heart rate test, just use the estimated value above.\\n\\nHere’s complete a sample. Let\\'s say you are a 40 year old inactive woman who wants to lose body fat. Let\\'s say we\\'ve determined that your resting heart rate in the morning is 70 beats per minute. And let’s say you will be working predominantly in Zone 2.\\n\\nEstimated maximum heart rate = 226 - age (40) = 186bpm Heart Rate Reserve: 186 - 70 = 116bpm Low end of training zone = (HRR x 60%) + 70bpm = 140 beats per minute High end of training zone = (HRR x 70%) + 70bpm = 151 beats per minutes\\n\\nThe training zone for this type of workout would be 140-151 BPM.\\n\\nPurchasing a Heart Rate Monitor:\\n\\nOnce you have determined your optimal training zones for each workout, the best way to ensure that you are in the correct zone is to invest in a heart rate monitor. This will allow for an accurate, quick analysis of your heart rate and the ability to easily intensify or reduce the intensity of your workout if you are not in the right zone. Unfortunately, manual heart rate monitoring (on your wrist or neck) has been found to be inaccurate with errors as high as 27 beats per minute. In addition, when testing on your neck or wrist, you have to stop and interrupt your workout to do the reading.\\n\\nWe encourage all clients to make the investment in a Heart Rate Monitor. You can purchase a good brand and model for less than $150. A heart rate monitor will allow you to program in your training zones and will beep if you are going too easy or too hard. It will also calculate your caloric expenditure so if you have a goal, you’ll know when to stop. Basically, it’s like having your trainer with you for all your workouts. We carry the Polar brand which is currently the best heart rate monitor brand with EKG accuracy and we’ll program it for you and teach you how to use it.\\n\\nRating of Perceived Exertion (RPE) Your heart rate can be affected by numerous variables such as food, medication, temperature, and stress so it is necessary to monitor the intensity of your workouts with an additional indicator – Rating of Perceived Exertion (RPE) scale. It is a scale that calls on your own perception of the intensity of a workout to indicate whether you are training in the appropriate zone. RPE is gaining popularity because of its effectiveness, simplicity, and safety. The RPE scale was developed by Dr. Gunnar Borg from Sweden. Borg noticed a close relationship between exercising heart rate (which is directly related to the intensity of the exercise) and how the athlete actually perceives his or her effort. The original BORG method used a scale from 6-20 however, has since been modified to the RPE scale using a more user-friendly scale from 0-10. Zero on the scale represents a resting level with no elevation in breathing. At the other extreme, a rating of 10 would indicate all-out severe exhaustion. Here is how to match up the numbers with your workouts.\\n\\n35\\n\\nRPE Scale\\n\\n0 – Represents a resting level with no elevation in your breathing.\\n\\n1 – Represents a more active rest, like working at your desk with no elevation in your breathing.\\n\\n2 – Represents an active resting level like getting dressed or walking around in your house with no elevation in your breathing.\\n\\n3 – Represents a low level of activity like gardening or the warm-up stages in a workout. You may be aware of your breathing but it is slow and natural.\\n\\n4 – Represents a low level of activity like a stroll or an easy bike ride with a slight elevation in breathing. You are still well within your comfort zone. This would be your predominant training zone if you fall within the General Health Training zone.\\n\\n5 – Represents a moderate level of activity like walking briskly. Your breathing is elevated higher than in level 4 but you are still well within your comfort zone. This would be your predominate training zone if you fall within the Weight Management Training zone or if you were scheduled for a long, easy workout.\\n\\n6 – Represents a moderate level of activity like walking briskly to a very late appointment. Your breathing is faster and deeper but you are still at a level that is within your comfort zone. You feel that you can comfortably hold a conversation. This will still be your Weight Management Training zone or your moderate intensity workout zone.\\n\\n7 – Represents a vigorous level of activity like jogging. Your breathing is more rapid and deep and you feel like you can hold a conversation but would probably prefer not to. This intensity is beginning to feel more challenging and outside of your comfort zone. This would be your predominate training zone if you fall within the Aerobic Conditioning/Weight Management zone or are performing a moderate intensity workout.\\n\\n8 – Represents a vigorous level of activity like faster running. You can hold a conversation but it would be short. You think you can continue for the remainder of your session, but you are not 100% confident that you can make it. You feel that you are outside of your comfort zone and being heavily challenged. This will still be your Aerobic Conditioning/Weight Management Training zone.\\n\\n9 – Represents a very, very vigorous level of activity like sprinting intervals in a run. Your breathing is very labored and you could not hold a conversation. You would definitely feel fatigued and outside of your comfort zone. This would be your predominate training zone if you fall within the Advanced Conditioning zone or were performing a short, hard workout.\\n\\n10 – Represents an all-out effort with severe exhaustion. It is not recommended that you train at this level.\\n\\nSummary:\\n\\nIt\\'s important to realize that you do not need to implement all of our suggestions into your program today. You may start by just committing to exercising three times per week. Then once you have made that a habit then you could perhaps, start mixing up the intensity zones by incorporating one easy, moderate and hard workout in each week. Then a few months later, you could try and incorporate a different type of activity. This is a work in progress. Enjoy the journey.\\n\\n36\\n\\nSECTION FOUR\\n\\nRESISTANCE TRAINING\\n\\n“If we did everything\\n\\nwe were capable of doing\\n\\nwe would literally astound ourselves.”\\n\\nThomas Edison\\n\\n37\\n\\n38\\n\\nBenefits of Resistance Training\\n\\nMost of us know that exercise is important but we tend to equate it with aerobic activity, like jogging, walking, swimming or cycling. Often, we forget that resistance training offers just as many health benefits as aerobic exercise. You can expect to experience the following benefits after initiating a resistance training program:\\n\\nIncreased muscle tone and definition \\uf0b7\\uf020 Increased muscular strength and endurance \\uf0b7\\uf020 Increased metabolic rate \\uf0b7\\uf020 Increased fat loss \\uf0b7\\uf020 Improved posture \\uf0b7\\uf020 Increased bone density \\uf0b7\\uf020 \\uf0b7\\uf020 Reduced risk for injury \\uf0b7\\uf020 Reduced risk for falling \\uf0b7\\uf020 \\uf0b7\\uf020 \\uf0b7\\uf020\\n\\nIncreased functional capacity Improved coordination and movement Increased athletic performance\\n\\nMore muscle = Less fat\\n\\nYour energy output during the day includes the energy expended as a result of your body functioning to sustain life (basal metabolic rate), food thermogenesis (the energy expended in response to food intake) and daily physical activity and exercise. The above items contribute to daily energy output by 70%, 20% and 10% respectively. So if you can even slightly affect your basal metabolic rate, you may significantly affect the daily calories expended. Remember that the average sized person burns 1kcal/min at rest. If the resting metabolic rate can be increased by just 10%, this equates to a rate of 1.1kcals/min. Doesn\\'t sound like a big deal, does it? But over an hour, this equates to an extra 6 calories and over a day, an extra 144 calories. Remember, that to burn a pound of fat you need to expend 3,500 calories more than you eat. This means that it would take 24 days (3500/144) to burn 1 pound of extra fat – and this does not include any calories expended from exercise. This amounts to about 15 pounds of fat which could be lost in one year by merely raising the metabolic rate by 10%. The question is - how do you raise your metabolic rate?\\n\\nAs we get older, our metabolism, the amount of calories we burn at rest, drops. This is related to a decline in the activity of our liver, kidneys, and other organs as we get older. This declining rate is almost entirely out of our control – almost! Examine the following chart which breaks down our metabolism.\\n\\n39\\n\\nBasal metabolic rate\\n\\nBrain\\n\\nOrgan metabolic rate (kcal/kg/day) 260\\n\\nOrgan weight\\n\\n1.4\\n\\nOrgan metabolic rate (kcal/day) 365\\n\\n% of basal energy expenditure 21%\\n\\nHeart\\n\\n600\\n\\n.3\\n\\n180\\n\\n20%\\n\\nKidney\\n\\n400\\n\\n.3\\n\\n120\\n\\n7%\\n\\nLiver\\n\\n359\\n\\n1.6\\n\\n560\\n\\n32%\\n\\nLung\\n\\n200\\n\\n.8\\n\\n160\\n\\n9%\\n\\nMuscle\\n\\n40% of total body weight\\n\\n24%\\n\\nYou can see that although your liver activity makes up the highest percentage of metabolic activity, there is really nothing you can do about that. It is in our best interest to keep our metabolism revving but we can\\'t decide \"All right, I need to increase my metabolic rate so I am going to get my liver in shape.” But in contrast, we can do something about our muscle activity which contributes 24 percent to our metabolic rate. Muscle comprises approximately 40% of our body weight. If you can get your muscles working at a higher level, the difference to your metabolic rate will be significant. By developing your muscular system, you will increase your metabolism. Muscle is an energy burning tissue and thus, the more of it you have on your body, the more fat you will burn both during exercise and during rest. How would you like to be sitting in front of the TV knowing you are burning more fat than you were before you started resistance training? In fact, one pound of muscle tissue expends an additional 30-40kcal/day. That does not sound like a lot but imagine that after an 8-12 week resistance training program, you can expect to develop 3-4 pounds of lean, muscle tissue. That equates to an extra 90-160 calories being burned per day. Add this up over 365days/year and we are talking about 10-14 pounds per year of fat either lost or not gained compared to not having that muscle mass. So if your goal is to lose body fat or maintain an ideal body fat percentage and lean physique, that should be enough motivation to get you into the weight room.\\n\\nWe also know that on average, we will lose 3-5 percent of muscle mass per decade after the age of 25. In fact, the average sedentary 80 year old man will have lost approximately 50% of his muscle mass. As a result, our fat mass will increase. If you want to reduce the magnitude of this age-related fat gain, start resistance training and depositing muscle on your body.\\n\\nThe difference of having more muscle on our body is even more significant during exercise. The difference in energy expended by a resting or working muscle is quite severe. When you start exercising, your muscles demand that your organs and tissues kick into action at a real high rate. So if you have more muscle demanding more energy, your caloric expenditure will sky-rocket! One study compared the energy costs of treadmill walking between obese and lean, highly muscular men who were the same weight and height. The results showed that the energy expenditure was significantly higher at any given speed and grade of walking for the body builders compared to the obese males. Expenditure reached up to 100 calories higher for the muscular men at a moderate walking pace up an incline. These results demonstrate that just by having more muscle on your body, you will burn more energy both during exercise and rest.\\n\\nResistance Training Guidelines:\\n\\nHere are some definitions that may help to clarify this component of your program:\\n\\nRepetition: refers to the number of times you perform an exercise without stopping.\\n\\nSet: refers to the number of times you perform a complete series of repetitions. For example, you may\\n\\n40\\n\\nperform 2 sets of 10 reps.\\n\\nThe American College of Sports Medicine recommends one set of 8-12 (10-15 if you are 50 years or older) repetitions for each major muscle group 2x/week to improve overall muscle conditioning. This recommendation is also sufficient to maximize fat loss. The repetition zone between 8-12 is the favored prescription because it will cause improvements in both muscular strength and endurance. And can you believe all you have to do is one set!\\n\\nHowever, if you are a more advanced exerciser or looking to increase the size of your muscles, it may be necessary for you to increase your volume of training and include multiple sets and exercises for each muscle area. But just because you are an advanced exerciser, doesn’t mean you have to do multiple sets of any exercise. You can achieve a high intensity, advanced workout using only one set of a variety of exercises. Years ago, trainers were taught to prescribe 3 sets of 10 reps for every exercise regardless of the person or the goal. Well, things have changed since then. Recently one-set training has received a lot of attention. One-set training is just that: one set of 8-12 reps of each exercise. The trick is that each set must be performed to momentary muscle fatigue (we’ll talk about that in just a bit).\\n\\nMany studies are now finding that one-set training can yield the same results as two to three sets. That\\'s very exciting news for the busy exerciser who can\\'t commit to spending hours in the gym. One-set training can dramatically cut down the time you need to spend in the weight room, giving you more time for other activities including cardio and stretching. Clients often have an easier time committing to their weight training program when they know they only need to be in the weight room for 40 minutes instead of an hour and a half. Because of this consistency, they experience great results!\\n\\nOne-set training also allows for more variety. Many personal trainers would rather have their clients perform nine different exercises working the muscles in a variety of different planes and angles instead of only 3 sets of three exercises. For example, instead of doing 3 sets of chest press, do one set of chest press, one set of chest flies and one set of push-ups.\\n\\nNow, keep this in mind. If you\\'ve been doing two or more sets of various exercises, it\\'s not that you\\'ve been training incorrectly. In fact, multiple set training has been used for years with great results. But now a new technique has surfaced. Research is demonstrating that intensity and not number of sets is the critical factor in weight training. So by sequencing your exercises correctly and ensuring you hit momentary muscle fatigue with each set, you\\'ll be able to achieve very similar benefits in less time. You can try it for a change in your program.\\n\\nMany exercisers, wanting to lose body fat and understanding that muscle is critical to maximize fat loss, have made muscle conditioning a priority. However, by spending extra time in the weight room they have sacrificed very critical cardiovascular exercise time. It is important to remember that you burn calories and fat directly during aerobic exercise and this component of your program should be your priority. Muscle conditioning is a must but you can’t neglect your cardiovascular training.\\n\\nFoundational Resistance Training Principles:\\n\\n\\uf020 Quality and execution of movement is critical. It makes no sense to perform 20 sloppy reps. It is far\\n\\nbetter to perform 8 reps with perfect form and then take a break. Proper execution of each rep is the most critical factor in weight training. Reps performed with poor technique will cause slower progress and may put you at risk for injury.\\n\\n\\uf020 Take it slow. Proper resistance training is not a fast sport. In fact Wayne Westcott, a leading Strength\\n\\nand Conditioning researcher, has determined that one repetition should take approximately 5-6 seconds;\\n\\n41\\n\\nthat is 2 seconds to lift the weight and 4 seconds to slowly lower the weight in a controlled fashion. Most people lift much too quickly using momentum instead of muscle. A proper set of 8-12 repetitions should take approximately 1 minute to complete. As you advance in your program, your trainer may incorporate speed and power training but it is typically done without heavy resistance and with tools that are more conducive to faster movements (medicine balls, body weight only training, exercise tubing etc).\\n\\n\\uf020 Breathe. A proper breathing rhythm will make each set more effective. Focus on exhaling as you lift\\n\\nthe weight or when you exert and inhale as you recover or lower the weight.\\n\\n\\uf020 Sit up straight. Proper posture is critical to ensure you are working the correct muscle groups and not putting your body at risk for injury. Always keep your abdominals contracted throughout the entire set of any exercise. Pull them up and in towards your spine to help stabilize your trunk. Keep your shoulders back and chest lifted up and out on any seated, bent over or standing exercise.\\n\\n\\uf020 A good exercise set will finish once you hit momentary muscle fatigue. This is the point during which you absolutely cannot do another rep with perfect form. If you can perform more reps, you should either perform the extra reps to hit momentary muscle fatigue or next time, increase the resistance so you can hit momentary muscle fatigue within the suggested repetition zone of 8-12 reps.\\n\\n\\uf020 Never go to failure. Failure is when you continue the set with poor technique or when other muscle groups have kicked in to help finish the set. It is important that you always avoid poor technique and muscle substitution.\\n\\n\\uf020\\n\\nIf you cannot perform 8 reps, the weight is typically too heavy. If you can perform 12 reps with perfect technique, increase the weight by 5%.\\n\\n\\uf020 Perform your muscle-conditioning sessions on alternating days. You may be surprised to learn that you don’t get stronger when you weight train. You actually get stronger during the rest periods in between your workouts. At a cellular level, when you weight train, your muscles experience microscopic minor tears. The body responds to this effect by sending blood and nutrients to the muscles to help them heal. And that’s exactly what they do. They respond by getting stronger. So it’s important never to work the same body part two days in a row. For example, if you can commit to 5 workouts a week, you may complete your cardio workouts on Monday, Wednesday and Saturdays and your full body muscle conditioning workouts on Tuesdays and Thursdays. Or if you can only commit to three workouts a week, you may do your cardio AND muscle conditioning on Mondays, Wednesdays and Fridays. Or if you are doing a split routine, you could do cardio and work out your lower body on Monday and Thursdays and your cardio and upper body on Tuesdays and Fridays.\\n\\n\\uf020 Put your mind into it. It is okay to disassociate while performing some fitness activities. For example, you can jump onto a treadmill and plug in a 7 minute mile pace and whether you think about it or not, you will expend the same amount of calories. However, this is not the case with muscle conditioning exercise. You must focus on what you\\'re doing because there is such a strong connection between the brain, the nerves and the muscles. We know that if you actually concentrate on what you are doing, you can significantly increase the amount of muscle activity measured during these exercises. So put down your magazines and really focus on each set. Each repetition and each set will become much more effective and you will experience results more quickly.\\n\\nWhich exercises will do the trick?\\n\\nThere are literally thousands of different exercises you could perform to get the results you are looking for. We don’t expect you to be the experts on program design. That’s our job. But here’s some of the principles that we adhere to you when customizing your program. At least you’ll know there is a method to our madness.\\n\\n42\\n\\nProgressions: At NW Women’s Fitness Club, we progress clients through three stages of movement. Once they demonstrate that they can perform the movements in Stage 1 with excellent execution and no pain, they can then graduate to the next stage. The stages are as follows: Learning Phase, Progressive Phase and Elite Phases. Here’s a summary of what to expect at each stage of progression.\\n\\nSTAGE 1 Learning & Conditioning Phase Teach technique, posture & alignment, slow speed of movement, muscle sensation & activation, breathing and core stabilization. Focus on consistency.\\n\\nSTAGE 2 Progressive Phase Begin to add more dynamic movements, slightly faster movements, more load and movements that require greater balance.\\n\\nSTAGE 3 Elite Phase Begin to add more impact, more skilled movements, more integrated movements, more speed and more intense movements.\\n\\nStart with basic exercises. It is necessary to progress from exercises that require the least amount of skill, coordination, balance, and overall fitness to exercises that maximally challenge these skills. This means that in the beginning, very basic exercises will do the trick. As you improve and master the technique of these exercises, then you should advance the program by incorporating more challenging exercises. It is important that you do not attempt a more challenging exercise without having first developed the basic foundation for the skill.\\n\\nHere are some types of movements that will be included in your program:\\n\\n\\uf020 Compound movements - movements that involve many joints and muscle groups within one\\n\\nexercise. For the lower body, exercises like Lunges, Step-ups and Squats are compound movements. For the upper body, exercises like Chin ups, Rows, Bench Press and Push-ups are compound movements. These types of movements are important because they train the body in a fashion that is similar to how we actually move in every day life. For example, every time you get out of a chair - that\\'s a squat. Every time you bend down to pick something up - that\\'s a lunge. However, you are going to want to progress into lunges and squats in a gradual fashion. In the beginning, start with just mini-bends into squats and lunges and progress into the deeper lunges and squats once you learn proper knee tracking and alignment and your muscles get strong enough to handle the deeper load. Many traditional exercises in the weight room are uni-jointed and involve only one muscle area. However, this is not really how our body moves. Most of the movements we perform everyday are compound. If we want to get stronger and be able to use this strength in our everyday lives, we have to train the muscles in a way that will allow those benefits to carry over to real-life movements.\\n\\n\\uf020\\n\\nIntegrated/Combination Training - These types of exercises are definitely compound in nature and involve combining 2 or more exercises into one, complex, fully-integrated, functional movement. For example, a squat with an overhead shoulder press would be a form of integrated training. A bicep curl while standing on a wobble board would be a form of combination training. The theory behind Combination Training is as follows - most movements that we perform every day involve the upper body having to work together with the lower body while we have to balance our body and stabilize our torso. However, many traditional exercises in the weight room are very isolated. So when someone is placed in an environment where the body has to use various muscle groups, the muscles don\\'t know how to respond correctly and effectively because they\\'ve never been trained to do this. It would be similar to a football coach taking each of his or her players and training them independently of each other. Although the coach could feasibly get each of the players into the best physical shapes of their life, if that team doesn\\'t get together and scrimmage, the first game will be a disaster. Our muscles work in a similar fashion. That is, each muscle can be strong independently of the others, however, if they haven\\'t learned how to react, oppose and resist each other, the strength in the weight\\n\\n43\\n\\nroom will not carry over as well into the real world. There are many cases of people who are very strong in the weight room - that is, they can lift a lot of weight. But they go home and lift some furniture or carry some heavy boxes and hurt their back and strain some connective tissue because they haven\\'t taught the muscles to work together. The message is this - you need to be strong in and out of the weight room. Combination Training movements will help you achieve this goal.\\n\\nThe IDEAL NWWFC Full Body Training Session\\n\\nKeep in mind this is an ideal template we recommend for most clients. Your trainer may adjust this program template based on your goals. For example, they may split your muscle conditioning sessions into lower body training days and upper body training days. They may sequence your exercises to focus on areas that are important to you. Again, since there a literally hundreds of different exercises to target all the components listed below, a trainer will help ensure you’re addressing all the important areas.\\n\\n\\uf020 First 5-10 minutes of workout – general ROM warm-up and physical prep for session – Medicine Ball\\n\\nChoppers/Tubing Rotations/Pulls/Presses\\n\\n\\uf020 3-6 Full Body Integrated Movements/Cardio/Metabolic/Agility Drills \\uf0b7\\uf020 1-4 Compound Lower Body Movements (Squats, Lunges, Step Ups, Deadlifts, 1 Leg Dips) \\uf0b7\\uf020 2-4 Compound/Isolated Pulling Movements (Chin-ups, Rows, Pulldowns, Reverse Flies) \\uf0b7\\uf020 1-3 Compound Pressing Movements (Pushups, Chest Press, Overhead Shoulder Press) \\uf0b7\\uf020 1 Bicep Exercise \\uf0b7\\uf020 2 Tricep Exercises (varied shoulder starting positions) \\uf0b7\\uf020 1-2 Bridging Exercises \\uf0b7\\uf020 1-2 Hip Stabilizer Exercises (Resisted Side Steps, Adduction, Side Lying Exercises) \\uf0b7\\uf020 1-2 Middle/Lower Trapezius/ External Rotator Exercises \\uf0b7\\uf020 2-3 Spinal Stabilization Exercises \\uf0b7\\uf020 1 Spinal Flexion Exercise \\uf0b7\\uf020 1 Lateral Spinal Flexion Exercise \\uf0b7\\uf020 1 Spinal Rotation Exercise \\uf0b7\\uf020 1-2 Spinal Extension Exercise \\uf0b7\\uf020 Total 20-30 Exercises \\uf0b7\\uf020 Last 5-10 minutes of session spent on cooldown/stretching/muscle release\\n\\nChange your program regularly. The only perfect resistance program is one that changes. A program that we design today, may be perfect today, but in about 4-8 weeks, it will no longer be perfect and not as effective. This is due to the Overload Principle - a training principle that all Personal Trainers must adhere to in order to help their clients experience ongoing results. When you first begin exercising, the body is exposed to a stimulus that it\\'s not used to and it will be forced to respond in a positive fashion by getting stronger and fitter. This is called a physical adaptation, which means that your body has structurally, biomechanically, and physiologically improved. But simultaneous with the physical adaptation is the physical plateau that many people experience. In order to experience ongoing results, the body must be stressed or stimulated to a greater degree than what it is used to. We know that the body needs to be\\n\\n44\\n\\nchallenged in order to progress. This overload principle can be adhered to by changing your program in a variety of different ways.\\n\\nFor example, you could:\\n\\n\\uf020 \\uf0b7\\uf020 \\uf0b7\\uf020 \\uf0b7\\uf020 Change/Advance the exercises \\uf0b7\\uf020 Adjust the order/sequence of exercises\\n\\nIncrease the resistance you lift Increase the number of sets Increase the number of days you strength train from 2 to 3 days per week\\n\\n\\uf06f\\uf020\\n\\nIt\\'s best to mix up the sequence of your routine during your weekly regime. For example, if you always do your cardio exercise first, next workout do a brief warm-up, then do your muscle conditioning exercises and then finish with your cardio. Then next workout, do your cardio first and muscle conditioning last. And on another day, alternate back and forth between muscle and cardio. It will be a completely different workout and a new stimulus for your muscles and your heart. With that said, if your primary goal is muscle conditioning and developing muscle tone/bulk, you may want to do your muscle conditioning first when you have the most energy and strength so you can really focus on this area.\\n\\n\\uf06f\\uf020 This same principle applies to lower body and upper body conditioning. For example, if you always do your legs first, then mix it up and next workout, do your upper body first and your lower body second. Or combine lower body and upper body movements into an integrated exercise. But again, if upper body is your focus, do this first when your energy levels are highest.\\n\\n\\uf020 Adjust the amount of recovery time you take between exercises. \\uf0b7\\uf020 Utilize a different resistance training technique. For example, superset training, pyramid training,\\n\\nsuper-slow training, split training, post-exhaust training, circuit training etc.\\n\\n\\uf06f\\uf020 When deciding which technique to use, remember there is no perfect training program. One\\n\\nstudy comparing nine different training routines found no statistically significant difference in the strength increase produced by any of them. So the message is clear - a multitude of training techniques will achieve results. Just be sure you change what you’re doing regularly.\\n\\nThis is where an investment in a personal trainer will save you a lot of time. Some of our clients see their trainer multiple times during the week. But even just one or two sessions every few months, in order to make the changes required for you to see continued results, will go a long way in maximizing your workout time. IDEA, the International Health and Fitness Association, released a statistic recently at one of their International conferences. It stated that only 25 percent of people working out in a gym are getting the results they want. But out of the 25 percent of people getting results, 90 percent of them are working with a personal trainer. So, it is quite clear that having a personal coach oversee your program, monitor your progress and make regular updates is an investment in your health worth making!\\n\\nOne last word for our Female Clients:\\n\\nMany of you may be concerned about putting on too much muscle. We realize that most of you do not want to gain a lot of muscle and do not want to look like the women on the cover of Muscle and Fitness. Well, we want to assure you that you do not need to be concerned with gaining this amount of muscle. Women typically do not have the natural levels of growth hormone and testosterone to develop muscles in this manner. These women are a very, very small percentage of our population and most of them workout for hours in the gym and are most likely using some form of supplementation or ergogenic aid to help them achieve this type of muscle build. Honestly, following the muscle endurance and strength guidelines in this manual is not at all about getting bulky - it is all about keeping the muscle you\\'ve got!\\n\\nStretch it out:\\n\\n45\\n\\n46\\n\\nSECTION FIVE\\n\\nNUTRITION\\n\\n“It is not the mountain that we conquer\\n\\nbut ourselves.”\\n\\nSir Edmund Hillary\\n\\n47\\n\\n48\\n\\nNutrition Principles\\n\\nMost people approach nutrition and dieting with unbelievable will power and determination. But unfortunately, will power will only last so long then biology and physiology takes over. Here’s an analogy – Try holding your breath under water for as long as you can. No matter how much you want to stay underwater, eventually biology kicks in and you have to come up for air. The same holds true with dieting. If you’re eating in a manner that stimulates your appetite, eventually, you are going to give in to the cravings regardless of how bad you don’t want to. So by understanding and adhering to the following nutrition tips you will approach nutrition and fat loss in a more educated fashion. You are going to outsmart your system!\\n\\nDo you remember this physics principle? Energy cannot be created nor destroyed; only transformed from one form to another. So energy coming into our bodies through food or drink must be transformed into another form of energy – either the energy to produce movement or stored energy (body fat) for later use.\\n\\nConsider the following Weight Loss/Gain/Maintenance Equation:\\n\\nWeight Lost: Calories In < Calories Out Weight Gained: Calories In > Calories Out Weight Maintained: Calories In = Calories Out\\n\\nYou can’t change this equation. But it’s important to understand all the variables that control each part of the equation.\\n\\nWhat Controls Calories In?\\n\\n\\uf020 Eating and Drinking provides you with calories in. You’ve probably heard that a calorie is a calorie.\\n\\nAnd although this is true, some calories that you consume can actually stimulate your appetite causing you to eat more. Or some foods are so dense in calories but provide such little volume that when you eat them, even though you’ve consumed a great deal of calories, you’re still hungry. And some food make you tired and less likely to want to move your body and less able to perform at your best. If your goal is fat loss or weight management, the best foods to eat are nutrient-rich foods that are lower in calories, fill you up and suppress your appetite. If your goal is to improve your energy levels and perform at your best, the best foods to eat are also nutrient-rich foods.\\n\\nWhat Controls Calories Out?\\n\\n\\uf020 You either expend calories by using them, storing them for later use or excreting them as waste \\uf0b7\\uf020 We use calories through:\\n\\n\\uf06f\\uf020 BMR: Basal Resting Metabolism – the amount of calories we expend at rest just to exist as\\n\\nhuman beings ▪ Can be raised (This is what we want): eating, exercise, muscle mass (1lb of muscle expends\\n\\n40 calories/day)\\n\\n▪ Can be lowered (This is what we don’t want): skipping meals, starving, resting\\n\\n\\uf06f\\uf020 Exercise \\uf06f\\uf020 NEAT – Non-exercise activity thermogenesis - Spontaneous Activity \\uf06f\\uf020 Excess post-oxygen consumption (EPOC) – The extra energy we burn after a workout is done \\uf06f\\uf020 Food Thermogenesis – The energy expended to digest food; the cost of digesting foods differ\\n\\nThe bad news is that it’s a lot easier to put the calories in than it is to take the calories out. Think of it this way. How long does it take to burn 1000 calories? About 90 minutes of exercise or 10 miles of running! How long does it take to consume 1000 calories? In about 5-10 minutes! So nutrition is at least half the battle in terms of losing body fat or maintaining your ideal physique.\\n\\n49\\n\\nThere is no trick to eating well. It is the stuff we have all heard before. Drink lots of water. Consume your required intake of fruits, vegetables and whole grain products. Minimize fat, alcohol and sugar intake. But there seems to be a gap between knowing what to do and actually adhering to these simple guidelines. There is no special grapefruit, cabbage, Low-protein or High-protein diet or pill that will get you the results you want quickly. And knowledge alone is not power! We all know what we have to do! It is finding the motivation and inspiration to make and adhere to very small changes in our nutrition plan that will facilitate success. Finding the motivation to stick to a healthy nutrition plan day-in-day-out is all it takes. Here\\'s the good news - you don\\'t have to starve yourself and you don\\'t have to limit your diet to carrots and broccoli.\\n\\nWith nutrition, the very small changes to your eating habits will often bring about big differences. The new habits just need to be consistent on a long-term basis. Perhaps start with one area at a time. Once you have that habit mastered, tackle the next nutrition goal. One step at a time and soon your diet will provide you with all the nutrients necessary to achieve optimum health.\\n\\nIn this section, we’re going to provide you with some easy nutrition tips and guide you through designing your own nutrition program. Our philosophy with nutrition is very similar to our take on exercise. If we design your nutrition program for you and tell you that you\\'ve got to eat broccoli everyday, but you hate broccoli, you are not going to experience any success. You have got to be involved in the process. It is necessary for you to design a program that you realistically believe that you could follow for a life-time. Remember, we do not believe in any quick fixes. We\\'re talking about a life-long effort.\\n\\nImportant Principle to Grasp: If you want to lose body fat, diets DON’T work!\\n\\nHow many studies need to be completed that prove diets do not work before our society gets it? The diet industry is still a multi-billion dollar one and continues to thrive despite desperate pleading from leading scientists telling us that diets do not work. We need to wake up and take a dose of reality – if it sounds too good to be true, it probably is!\\n\\nYou see, when you diet your body actually starts to work against your efforts. As soon as you undertake a restricted caloric intake, your body moves into \"famine stage\" or \"starvation response\". Basically, your body does not know when its next meal will be and whether the energy intake will be sufficient for all its internal functions to operate optimally. So, your body, being such an effective piece of machinery, just slows all internal functions. You move into efficiency mode - a physical slowing down of metabolism. This is absolutely the last thing you want to happen. If you want to maximize fat loss, you definitely want to keep your metabolism revving at a high rate, not at a slow rate! The only way to do this is to eat properly and exercise.\\n\\nYou may notice that after you eat a meal, you feel warmer. The heat comes from digesting your meal. Your liver, pancreas, stomach and intestines have to produce digestive enzymes which requires energy. Many people who are starting to gain weight, conclude that their metabolism may be slowing down, and decide to eat less. This will depress their metabolism even more. The point here is that digestion requires energy and will raise your metabolic rate. If fat loss is your goal, you will want to ensure you are eating regularly enough to raise your metabolic rate to a point where you experience a caloric deficit. Dieting suppresses your metabolic rate! We must avoid this at all costs!\\n\\nLosing 10 pounds is easy. Lock yourself in a closet for a few days and consume just enough water to sustain life. By week\\'s end, you will definitely be 10 pounds lighter. You see when dieting, the scale shows positive confirmation that you are doing the right thing. You will definitely start to lose weight. But the problem is, if you are dieting and have lost 10 pounds, you have not lost 10 pounds of fat. Instead, you have lost only 2 pounds of fat, 3 pounds of water and 5 pounds of muscle. The muscle loss is the worst thing about quick weight loss diets. Muscle is an energy burning tissue and when dieting, you will lose a whole lot of it. You can imagine what that will do to your ability to burn calories both during rest and 50\\n\\nexercise. If fat loss is your goal, you must hang on very tightly to your muscle mass as this will keep your metabolism revving at a high rate.\\n\\nStudies have also shown that dieting actually makes you less likely to move throughout the day – you sit rather than stand, take an elevator instead of the stairs, fidget less at your desk – so that by the end of the day, even though you have reduced your food intake, you have also reduced your energy output. The bottom line: You lose no body fat.\\n\\nDieting also sets restrictions and limitations that are unrealistic and unsustainable in the long run. You most likely will end up bingeing and feeling like a failure.\\n\\nThat brings us to the most serious failure of diets: keeping the weight off. That is clearly the most difficult thing to do. Most people associate diets as a short-term phenomenon. They believe that as soon as they achieve the goal weight loss, they can go back to eating their normal diet. Of course, they inevitably gain all the weight back. When on a diet, a person will feel sensations of depression and deprivation. These are emotions they can not wait to rid of and so their thoughts center around the day when their diet finishes. A University of California study found that 90 percent of dieters who follow a prescribed diet eventually regain the weight they have lost. The 10 percent who were successful in keeping the weight off, 73 percent of them kept the weight off by just making healthy eating and lifestyle choices. So when you are deciding on a particular eating plan, ask yourself if you can realistically follow the eating plan for years. If not, stay away from it because as soon as you stop the plan, you will regain the weight. If a plan imposes strict limits or requires only a few types of foods, a red warning light should go off.\\n\\nThe bottom line is not new but it bears repeating: The only way to take weight off and keep it off is to exercise regularly and eat nutritiously. It makes sense to realize that if you want to weigh 10 pounds less, ten years from now, it is what you do over the next ten years, not the next 6 weeks! Short-term restrictive diets set people up for failure. A healthy nutrition plan that you believe you can realistically follow for the rest of your life is the only nutrition plan that will work!\\n\\nNutrition Habit #1 Consume a balanced diet that is rich in Fiber\\n\\nCarbohydrates (CHO): are fruits, vegetables and whole grain breads, pastas and rice. Carbohydrates in your diet will be sent to your liver and either burned for energy or stored as fat (70% conversion ratio). Did you know the only energy your brain can use is carbohydrates? That’s why low-carb diets never work for the long-term. You wind up being tired, irritable and have a hard time focusing.\\n\\nYou will want to ensure your diet is 60% carbohydrate content - Of this amount 50% should be in the form of fruits and vegetables and complex carbohydrates which are your whole grain products and no more than 10% from simple carbohydrates (cakes, cookies, ice cream etc.) Be sure to avoid white (enriched, refined, bleached) breads, pastas and rice. Avoid foods where sugars like High Fructose Corn Syrup are listed as one of the first few ingredients.\\n\\nAnd you\\'re also going to want to limit your intake of no-fat or low-fat products. You are probably thinking \"What? Limit no-fat foods? But aren\\'t they the answer to all my fat-loss prayers?\" It is interesting to note that since the explosion of no-fat products onto the market, our population continues to get fatter and fatter! You would think we would start to get skinnier as we consumed more of these no-fat products! But what do you think makes those no-fat products taste so good? Sugar –and lots of it! And what do you think sugar is made of? A lot of calories! Excess calories, whether they come from no-fat cookies or full-fat cookies, are still going to show up on our hips and thighs and abs.\\n\\n51\\n\\nProtein: Protein gets broken down into small amino acids which go to the liver to be used for growth, repair, and maintenance of muscles and tissues. If not used, it will be converted to glucose and then fat (70% conversion ratio)\\n\\nBalance your diet with 15-20% protein. You can go to our website at www.nwwomensfitness.com to determine your individual protein needs. Click on Member Zone. Then click on Cool Fitness Tools.\\n\\nGood Sources of Protein:\\n\\n\\uf020 Salmon, along with most other fishes and sea foods. \\uf0b7\\uf020 Poultry (w/out skin and white meat is leaner) \\uf0b7\\uf020 Beef (Lean cuts) \\uf0b7\\uf020 Pork (white cuts) \\uf0b7\\uf020 Soy Products \\uf0b7\\uf020 Egg Whites \\uf0b7\\uf020 Whey Products\\n\\nFat: Fats get broken down into smaller fatty acids and are used for cell functioning, insulation (protection and warmth) and energy. If not used, it becomes an amazing source of stored energy\\n\\n\\uf020 The average person carrying 30 pounds of body-fat is carrying 105,000 calories of stored energy\\n\\n– that’s enough energy to complete 40 marathons back to back!\\n\\nYour diet should be 20-30% fat content. Note: A no-fat diet is unrealistic and unhealthy.\\n\\nReducing Fat: While reading labels, look at the order of ingredients. If fat is listed as one of the first, second or third ingredients, the product is likely to be high in fat and is best to be limited or avoided. Items like lard, animal shortening, oils, butterfat, whole milk solids, shortening, and margarine are all fats.\\n\\nSome obvious foods that you are going to want to avoid are as follows: \\uf0b7\\uf020 Fried foods – fried foods are saturated in fat and oil and calories! \\uf0b7\\uf020 Creams – very high in fat content \\uf0b7\\uf020 Processed foods – like cakes and cookies, etc.\\n\\nWhile a reduction in fat is usually a good thing for most people, there is a point of diminishing returns and health risks. Just so you know, fat is the best fuel ever designed! We can make fat out of almost anything we eat and use it for energy. Can you imagine if your car could do that? Put in potatoes and the engine miraculously converts them into gas. In goes apples and instantly we get gasoline. Fat is an amazing fuel that provides us with a limitless amount of energy. Instead of hating fat and blaming it for all our problems, we should be astounded and respect it for its outstanding capabilities. Certain fatty acids are also necessary for good health, and \"fat soluble\" vitamins require fat for absorption into the system.\\n\\nIt is true that most people do not have to worry about getting too little fat in their diet, but there is another reason to be less obsessed about reducing fat to super-low levels; fat contributes to feelings of satiety (fullness) and helps reduce food cravings. Many people who cut a lot of fat out of their diets, often eat far too much of other ”non-fat\" foods that are high in calories. So the key is to just make sure that your total fat intake is within the accepted guidelines of 20-30% of total daily calories. No more than 10 percent of this should come from saturated fats. The average fat content of most diets is greater than 43 percent – this of course, is what is making our society fatter! When deciding to reduce your fat intake, remember that there are fats in your diet that are obvious – these are the ones you can see – foods such as butter, margarine, cooking oils, spreads, and fat on meat. And there are also fats that are hidden in processed foods such as cakes, cookies, ice cream and potato chips. It will be important to limit your intake from both these fat sources.\\n\\n52\\n\\nUnsaturated fats, especially the monounsaturated ones, are considered healthier and are found in nuts, seeds, olives, vegetable oils and soft margarine products. However, we’ve discovered many people consuming very high amounts of nuts because they’ve heard or read it’s healthy. A healthy amount of nuts is a HANDFUL. More than this and you are consuming a huge amount of calories. They call it “Trail- Mix” for a reason! You should be on a HIKING TRAIL expending a huge amount of calories to need the energy from the trail-mix. It’s not called “Office-Desk Mix” or “Sitting watching football Mix”!\\n\\nIncreasing your Omega 3 & 6 Fats found in fish, walnuts, olives, avocados, flaxseed is also a healthy habit. You can obtain healthy levels by eating a 4 ounce serving of fish three times per week or 2-gram fish oil every day or an ounce of walnuts a day.\\n\\nSaturated fats are found in animal products such as beef, butter, dairy products and lard. They tend to raise blood cholesterol levels, thereby increasing risk for heart disease. Also be cautious of consuming a large amount of coconut and palm oils. These are vegetable oils but they contain a large amount of saturated fat. You have probably also heard of trans fatty acids. These are the end products of a process called hydrogenation, in which vegetable oils are hardened. You should avoid consumption of this type of fat. Butter is a saturated fat and margarine contains trans fatty acids, both of which can increase the risk for heart disease.\\n\\nAs you begin to reduce the amount of fat and increase the amount of fruits, vegetables and whole grain products in your diet, your fiber intake will automatically increase. Fiber is so important in our diets because it keeps us full longer therefore, helping to suppress our appetites. But as you initially start to adopt many of these healthy habits, you may notice that you start to experience a lot more intestinal gas. To reduce the initial negative effects of a high fiber diet, change your diet gradually, and soon your body will adapt to your new, healthier diet. You may also want to consider taking a product that will help you manage these side-effects such as Beano. You’ll get the recommended 20-35 grams of fiber each day by consuming a minimum of 2 servings of fruit, 3 servings of vegetables and 4 servings of whole grains.\\n\\nSample Meals when you’re Busy:\\n\\nYou’ve got to get the kids ready for school…laundry started….dishwasher emptied. You’ve got emails to answer…Appointments and meetings to make…Projects to complete…Your daughter needs to be dropped off at soccer practice; your son at basketball. Many people report that life is so busy that it’s difficult to stick to a healthy eating plan and instead, they find themselves resorting to fast-food way too often. But eating well is what’s going to provide you the energy and the mental stamina to perform at your best. Here are some quick solutions to eating healthy:\\n\\nYou have got to eat breakfast no matter how busy you are. Think of it as filling up on an empty tank.

So make the commitment to paying better attention to your nutrition, and enjoy the positive consequences to all areas of your life.\\n\\nFree Days:\\n\\nAnd when we say balanced - we really means balanced. A balanced diet will help you maintain a healthy body composition and weight and provide you with the nutrients for optimal health and functioning. All foods can be eaten in a healthy diet - you just need to have some boundaries and parameters. A successful nutrition plan will focus on what you need to be consuming every day rather than what you should not be eating. For example, set a goal of eating 3 fruits for the day instead of deciding to not eat any chocolate. In addition, allow yourself one or two \"free\" days every week. For example, if you love pizza, and chocolate, then one day a week allow yourself to indulge in these items. This will eliminate the feeling of being deprived of your favorite foods and you will be less likely to experience the inevitable binge that goes hand- in-hand with total elimination of your favorites. This type of plan is feasible for most people. You are not telling yourself you are never going to eat chocolate again, but instead, just limiting how much and when\\n\\n54\\n\\nyou will indulge. Just make sure you don’t go crazy on your free days. It’s not a free ticket to gorge! And try to avoid making deals with yourself regarding your free days. If Saturday is your free day, make sure you stick to Saturday. For example, avoid indulging on Thursday because there’s an office party and then promising that on Saturday, you will skip your free day. Often you end up of taking more free days than you agreed to and all of a sudden every day turns into a ‘free’ day.\\n\\nWe prefer to follow the 80:20 rule for nutrition, which states that if you are eating well 80 percent of the time, you can allow yourself to indulge the other 20 percent. Eating well 80 percent of the time will definitely keep you healthy and will be a much more enjoyable process. This type of belief system is long- term focused. It is important that you decide to only do things that you can see yourself doing for the rest of your life. The only way to do this is to achieve your goals while upsetting your life as little as possible. Look at it this way – even our NW Women’s Fitness Club Personal Trainers indulge so don’t try to be ‘perfect’. That will just set you up for disappointment!\\n\\nNutrition Habit #2 Drink More Water\\n\\nDid you know that 50-70% of our total body weight is water? The brain is composed of 70 percent water, lungs are nearly 90 percent water and our blood is about 83 percent water, which helps digest our food, transport and eliminate waste and toxins, mobilize fat, and control body temperature. Think of it this way, every tissue cell, organ and system is comprised of water and functions optimally only in the presence of adequate water levels. So even fat loss will not occur at an optimal rate if you are in a dehydrated state. Plus water helps to suppress our appetite.\\n\\nWater is our life force, in fact, we could only go a few days without water before our body would start to deteriorate and die. According to the American Dietetic Association’s Complete Food and Nutrition Guide, the average adult loses about two and a half quarts or about 10 cups of water daily through urine and sweat. Just cover your entire arm with a plastic bag and within a few minutes you’ll get a very visual display of how much water we lose in a day. Think of the good old-fashioned sweat suits designed to make you sweat and lose weight. Yeah, you lost weight but it wasn’t fat weight, it was very valuable water weight!\\n\\nTo maintain your body’s fluid balance, you need to replace at least the 10 cups of water (80 ounces) everyday. This amount needs to be increased in hot weather conditions or for those who exercise who may lose up to a liter per hour during a workout. Plus, as we age, there is a general loss of water in all tissues – it’s like the plum to prune effect! We’d personally prefer to be healthy, hydrated plums than dried up, old prunes so we drink our water!\\n\\nBut, unfortunately most people exist on a daily basis in a dehydrated state. In fact common complaints like headaches, lack of energy, feeling tired and lethargic, being prone to sickness and injury, kidney stones, constipation and achy joints and muscles have been associated with dehydration. If most people would commit to drinking 10 glasses of pure water every day they would notice a great improvement in their overall health, body composition and energy levels.\\n\\nKeep in mind though, we obtain water in our diets from drinks, either plain water or as part of other beverages and from solid foods, especially fruits and vegetables. So we encourage clients to get at least 80 ounces (10-8 ounce or 5-16 ounce glasses) of pure water and see how their body responds. Any other additional fluids you consume in the form of juice, milk, or herbal teas will be a bonus.\\n\\nIn the beginning, your body and its tissues are not used to this higher level of fluid and so they will initially just flush it out. And yes, you will be spending a great deal of time in the restroom but it won’t last long. Eventually, your need to run to the washroom all day should decrease. Your body will soon adapt to your hydrated state. You thirst mechanism will also become more efficient and you’ll find that the more you drink, the more thirsty you become. That’s a great sign!\\n\\n55\\n\\nMost people know they should be drinking more water but they don’t. We’ve found it’s not in the knowing, it’s in the doing! You’ll have to take some action steps to help you adhere to this goal. For example, purchase a water cooler for home and work so you always have cold, refreshing water available. Be sure to drink some water every time you pass the cooler. You can also purchase an 80 ounce water bottle from many grocery and department stores so you can fill up your bottle in the morning and make it a goal to finish the whole thing before you go to bed. This works great for us. Have your bottle with you wherever you go. If you don’t like the big water jug idea, drink a 16 ounce glass of water first thing in the morning and then 20 minutes before each meal and snack. You’ll easily hit 80 ounces. Many athletes use what’s called a ‘Camel-Back’, a water sac that hooks on like a back pack with a water-hose that allows you to drink easily and continuously throughout workouts. This is a great way to replenish all those extra fluids during tough workouts. During workouts, you should strive to drink 8 ounces of water every 15 minutes. Note: During long bouts of intense exercise (2 hours or more), you can drink TOO much water! It\\'s best to use a sports drink instead of just plain water, as this will help replace sodium and electrolytes lost in sweat and reduce the chances of developing hyponatremia, which can be life-threatening!\\n\\nTake our word for it – water is important to your overall health. We hope this clarifies and provides better insight to the importance of water in your diet.\\n\\nNutrition Habit #3 Plan your meals so that you consume 5 small meals and snacks throughout the day\\n\\nSee if you recognize yourself in any of the following. You skip breakfast, guzzle coffee all morning and then, practicing great self-control, you eat a tiny lunch. By mid-afternoon, you are starving and so you grab a quick pick-me-up chocolate bar or muffin. By the time you get home, you are hungry, irritable, tired and ready for dinner. You stuff yourself at the dinner table and then snack all evening. You go to bed on a full stomach, and tomorrow the cycle begins all over again.\\n\\nThis type of eating pattern is common and has your body working against you rather than for you. Many people who do not eat breakfast and consume only a very light lunch are tricked into believing that they are reducing their caloric intake when, in fact, they are actually setting themselves up for a snacking binge in the late afternoon, followed by an overload at dinner and into the evening. The result is just the opposite of what you intend: Total calories consumed during the day will end up being higher rather than lower! And the scale gives you the bad news that you are gaining weight.\\n\\nThe theory is this: Our bodies are not very good at burning calories from a big meal, especially in the evening when all our systems tend to slow down. Many of our evening calories, then, are more likely to be stored as fat.\\n\\nYour metabolism, the rate at which you burn calories for internal functions, is like an engine – the more often you give it fuel, the better it works. When you deprive your body of food, even for short periods of time, your metabolism automatically slows down in order to preserve energy. And a slowed metabolism makes it much more difficult to lose weight and much easier to gain weight. The type of diet that is not consistent in caloric and nutrient intake will also lead to a more rapid loss in muscle tissue - we want to avoid this at all costs. The good news is you can get your body to work for you instead of against you. The rule should be that you do not go any more than three to four hours without eating something.\\n\\nThink of starting your day by revving your internal engine. This means regardless of whether you are a breakfast person or not, you must develop the habit of having something to eat in the morning. Your momma was right – breakfast is the most important meal of the day but it does not need to be a 5-course meal. A piece of fruit, bagel, cereal and milk or toast and juice will do the trick. Then a few hours later, try a small snack like a piece of fruit and a cup of yogurt. By lunchtime, you are not going to have a\\n\\n56\\n\\nproblem making a healthy, low-fat, low-calorie choice. A half-sandwich and salad or bowl of chili or vegetable soup might be an appropriate lunch. A few hours later, in the afternoon, eat another light snack like a handful of walnuts, and some celery and carrot sticks or crackers and cheese. By the time dinner comes around, you will not be ravenous and you will be less likely to indulge and consume too many calories. This type of eating pattern keeps your metabolism revved all day, keeps your blood sugar at a healthy level, will keep your energy levels up and will help avoid the tendency to over-eat at any meal. You\\'ll be a lot more enjoyable to be around also. Most of us have been conditioned to believe that dinner should be the largest meal of the day, so changing your eating patterns is not going to be easy. It will not happen overnight. You will probably have to change other old habits too. If, for example, you snack in the evening while watching TV, you might need to go for a walk in the evening instead. If you find yourself bored in the evening and eating because there is nothing else to do, think about enrolling in an evening course or start reading a good book. Breaking habits is very difficult in the beginning but eventually it will become second nature.\\n\\nNutrition Habit #4 Stop Eating Three Hours before Bedtime\\n\\nIf you have planned your meals correctly throughout the day, you shouldn’t need to eat anything right before bed. Often the calories that are consumed after dinner are those that are eaten not because you are hungry and need the energy but because of habitual patterns or boredom. Think of it this way – you are just going to bed. How much energy do you really need? If you find yourself needing to eat late at night, choose something that is low in calories just to get you by until morning.\\n\\nNutrition habit #5 Control your Portion Sizes\\n\\nYou\\'ve got to pay attention to your portion sizes. We are victims of a society that is hooked on supersizing everything…supersize drinks, monster size cookies, muffins and bagels and astronomical sized restaurant entrees. For many of us, it may not be that our food choices are poor, we may just be eating too much of a good thing. Out of control portions will lead to weight gain and often cause people to feel lethargic.\\n\\nHere is a very important message to remember. If at the end of the day, you have expended fewer calories than the number of calories you have consumed from any source, you will store these calories as fat. Here is how it works:\\n\\nLet\\'s say you consume an extra 1,000 carbohydrate calories in the form of plain pasta. It takes about 30 percent of the calories consumed to break down the dietary carbohydrate and store it as body fat. So out of the 1,000 extra carbohydrate calories, 700 will be stored as body fat. Now, let\\'s say you consume an extra 1,000 fat calories in the form of creams. It takes about 3% of the calories consumed to break down this dietary fat and store it as body fat. So, out of the 1,000 extra fat calories, 970 will be stored as body fat.\\n\\nIt is obviously better to be consuming a diet rich in carbohydrates because less of the excess will actually be stored as body fat. But you will store excess carbohydrates as body fat and you will gain weight, whether your diet is low in fat or not. If your diet contains more calories than you expend in a day, you will gain weight regardless of the source of the calories.\\n\\nWhen reducing food intake and portion sizes, the reduction should occur in the following order: 1. Reduce fat intake 2. Reduce alcohol intake 3. Reduce sugar intake 4. Reduce starches (pasta, breads, rice)\\n\\n57\\n\\nIt is also wise to pay close attention to serving sizes listed on labels. Sometimes what is listed as one serving size is unrealistically small. So you may trick yourself into believing that you are consuming an item that is low in caloric and fat content, when in fact, what you are actually consuming is four times the listed serving size.\\n\\nHere are some realistic portion sizes: \\uf0b7\\uf020 A serving of meat, fish or poultry should be about the size of the palm of your hand \\uf0b7\\uf020 Your fruit and vegetable servings should be about the size of a tennis ball \\uf0b7\\uf020 A serving size of cottage cheese, rice, pasta, cereal or other starch is the size of a tennis ball \\uf0b7\\uf020 A slice of bread, one small roll, or a half bagel or bun counts as one serving \\uf0b7\\uf020 A serving of sandwich cheese is one slice \\uf0b7\\uf020 A serving size of fats, oils, nuts, seed is about the size of your thumb\\n\\nTechniques for Reducing Portion Sizes:\\n\\n\\uf020 Use a smaller plate. Instead of using a traditional dinner plate, use an appetizer/salad size plate\\n\\ninstead. This will force you to start with fewer calories right away. We’ve been taught as kids to eat what’s on our plate. So a bigger plate automatically means more calories.\\n\\n\\uf020 Divide your plate into 4 parts. A quarter of the plate will be reserved for a starch (whole grain rice, pasta, bread/roll), a quarter of the plate will be reserved for protein and the last half of the plate should be reserved for fruits and/or vegetables.\\n\\n\\uf020 20 minutes before you eat your meal, have a cup of soup, a handful of walnuts, a small salad, a\\n\\ncup of juice or 8-16 ounces of water. This will help to suppress your appetite.\\n\\n\\uf020 To help control portions, keep a food log and submit it to a professional.\\n\\n\\uf020 To help avoid mindless, late-night eating, brush your teeth after dinner. Pop a breath mint or breath\\n\\nstrip. Go for a walk. Read a book. Take a bath.\\n\\n\\uf020 Buy single serving items or place snacks in small plastic baggies to help control portions.\\n\\n\\uf020 Avoid buying in bulk. Studies show that when people buy in bulk, they also eat in bulk. Remember –\\n\\nif it’s there, you’ll eat it!\\n\\n\\uf020 Eat slowly. The brain needs 20 minutes to receive the signal that you’re full.\\n\\n\\uf06f\\uf020 After food is placed in front of you, wait 5 minutes before you eat \\uf06f\\uf020 Place small mouthfuls of food on fork/spoon \\uf06f\\uf020 Completely swallow food before you add more food to fork/spoon \\uf06f\\uf020 Put down utensils in between bites \\uf06f\\uf020 Use smaller utensils \\uf06f\\uf020 Consciously take time to taste, chew and savor food \\uf06f\\uf020 Stretch out meals, making them last 30 minutes. Take a five minute break about 10 minutes into\\n\\nyour meal\\n\\n\\uf06f\\uf020 Take sips of water or other non-caloric beverages between bites \\uf06f\\uf020\\n\\nIntroduce a one or two minute delay between courses\\n\\n\\uf020 When eating out:\\n\\n\\uf06f\\uf020 Order one meal and ask for two plates so you can split the meal. \\uf06f\\uf020 Don’t order super-size meals; opt for regular or kiddie portions instead \\uf06f\\uf020 Share desserts\\n\\n58\\n\\n\\uf06f\\uf020 Order water immediately \\uf06f\\uf020 Order butter and salad dressing on the side \\uf06f\\uf020 Ask for your meat broiled and without any additional fat added \\uf06f\\uf020 Ask for your chicken to be prepared without the skin \\uf06f\\uf020 Order a salad instead of french fries \\uf06f\\uf020 Ask for skim milk \\uf06f\\uf020 Order a tomato instead of cream sauce for pasta dishes \\uf06f\\uf020 Order plain bread instead of garlic bread \\uf06f\\uf020 Take one piece of bread from the basket and then ask for the basket to be taken away.\\n\\nOr ask for a complimentary vegetable platter instead of bread basket.\\n\\n\\uf06f\\uf020 Order tomato and broth soups instead of cream-based soups \\uf06f\\uf020 Order fresh fruit desserts \\uf06f\\uf020 Hold the sauce on burgers and instead use ketchup, mustard, relish, tomato and lettuce \\uf06f\\uf020 Do not be afraid to ask for any type of substitution\\n\\nThe Hunger Scale – Learn to use this scale to rate your hunger and fullness\\n\\n0 – Ravenous, Primal Hunger. I’m so hungry I could die! 1 – Extremely Hungry, dizzy, shaky, faint 2 – Very hungry, irritable, finding it hard to concentrate 3 – Stomach growling 4 – Hungry but not ravenous 5 - Totally comfortable 6 – Feeling like I ate too much 7 - Stomach is stretched/uncomfortable 8 – Very Full/Stuffed 9 – Very Full and Bloated/Overstuffed 10 – So Full it Hurts, Feels like I’m going to explode, Feel sick to my stomach\\n\\n\\uf020 LEVELS 0-2: Signifies ravenous hunger. This is when you are most likely to overeat. \\uf0b7\\uf020 LEVELS 3-4: These are the best times to eat. Your body is saying that it needs food. \\uf0b7\\uf020 LEVELS 5-10: Starting to eat at these levels indicates emotional, not physical hunger.\\n\\n\\uf06f\\uf020 Eating until you reach level 6 and higher may indicate that you\\'ve lost touch with your physical\\n\\nhunger.\\n\\nBecome aware of your impulses and urges:\\n\\n\\uf020 What traps you into overeating? Is it a certain time of day? Is it the people you hang with? Is it paired with some type of activity? Do you get the urge to eat in certain places? Do you turn to food when you’re tired after work?\\n\\n\\uf020 Make a list of substitute activities. They must be activities that compete with the action of\\n\\neating - ie. it’s difficult to eat while doing the activity.\\n\\n\\uf06f\\uf020 Hobby, gardening, play a game with family/friends, learn a new sport, visit your\\n\\nneighbors/friends, write in a journal, give yourself a manicure, read a magazine/book, plan your next vacation, Relaxation/breathing exercises, walk/jog/swim/bike ride/go to gym/exercise video/dance to some upbeat music, shower, bath, get a massage, listen to music, prayer, meditation, housework, pay bills, balance your check book, complete a home improvement project, rearrange your furniture, wash your car, clean out closets/drawers, run errands, floss, take dog for a walk, video games\\n\\n\\uf020 Then when your impulse or urge surfaces, immediately start your substitute activity. The urge\\n\\nshould pass.\\n\\n59\\n\\nIf you recognize that you need to focus on controlling your portion sizes, you may initially feel a bit hungry for a few weeks. But that hunger-sensation won’t last long. Your stomach is capable of shrinking and will learn to be satisfied with the smaller meals. Plus when you’re eating the right type of foods, you’ll have more energy and your appetite will effectively suppressed making your plan much easier to adhere to.\\n\\nNutrition Habit #6 Commit to Shopping at least once per week and stocking up on healthy choices.\\n\\nWhat happens if you get home and you are starved and there is nothing to eat? You are more likely to choose a less-healthy item or dial up a take-out restaurant and order something high in fat and calories. If you want to commit to a healthy diet, you have got to commit to setting up a framework for success. This includes planning a trip to the grocery shop weekly and then potentially one or two smaller trips during the week to top up on fresh fruits and veggies. You can not expect to adhere to a healthy diet without making this very important commitment to yourself.\\n\\n\\uf020 Shop from a grocery list prepared when you are not hungry or stressed out \\uf0b7\\uf020 Determine exactly what you need for a particular period of time. This is where meal-planning for the week ahead really helps. For example, keep what you’ll eat for breakfast, lunch and snacks pretty simple and consistent. Then decide what you’ll eat for dinners each night. For example, Monday you’ll make a home-made vegetarian pizza. Tuesday, you’ll make salmon, vegetables and rice. Wednesday, you’ll do a chicken, vegetable pasta marinara and salad. Thursday, you’ll do a shrimp and vegetable stir-fry. Friday, you’ll eat out. Saturday, you’ll do chicken burgers, vegetables and salad. And Sunday, you’ll make chicken, bean and vegetable burritos. Then buy what you need to make each meal throughout the week. Don’t overbuy – Be careful of bulk buying.\\n\\n\\uf020 Never go grocery shopping when you’re hungry. \\uf0b7\\uf020 As soon as you get home, plan time to clean, cut and chop fresh produce to ensure it’s ready to be eaten (unless you buy the pre-cut and washed). Cook-a-thons will also make sticking to your nutrition plan a lot easier. Opening the fridge to find a bowl of chili, home-made soup, pasta salad or chopped vegetables will make it more likely that you grab for these healthier items.\\n\\nGreat foods to put in your shopping cart:\\n\\nWhole Grains: \\uf0b7\\uf020 Oatmeal \\uf0b7\\uf020 Cold cereal – Cherrios, , Bran, Granola \\uf0b7\\uf020 100% whole grain bread or English muffins (or other bread products) \\uf0b7\\uf020 100% whole wheat pitas \\uf0b7\\uf020 100% whole wheat tortillas \\uf0b7\\uf020 100% whole wheat pizza shells \\uf0b7\\uf020 Brown Rice \\uf0b7\\uf020 100% whole wheat pasta\\n\\nMeats:\\n\\n\\uf020 Skinless, boneless chicken breast halves and/or frozen cut-up chicken for stir-fries \\uf0b7\\uf020 Skinless salmon filets / 1 whole fish \\uf0b7\\uf020 Skinless turkey breasts \\uf0b7\\uf020 Sliced cooked salmon, turkey or chicken \\uf0b7\\uf020 White porkchops \\uf0b7\\uf020 Ground turkey or lean beef \\uf0b7\\uf020 Frozen chicken or vegetable meat patties\\n\\n60\\n\\nDairy:\\n\\n\\uf020 Skim milk or low-fat soy/rice/oatbran milk fortified with vitamin D and calcium \\uf0b7\\uf020 Eggs \\uf0b7\\uf020 1 bag of part-skim shredded mozzarella cheese \\uf0b7\\uf020 Container of feta-cheese \\uf0b7\\uf020 Low-fat probiotic Yogurt cups\\n\\nFrozen Foods:\\n\\n\\uf020 Bags of frozen veggies – green beans, peas, broccoli, corn, stir-fry \\uf0b7\\uf020 Bags of frozen fruit – blueberries, raspberries, strawberries \\uf0b7\\uf020 Frozen Meals – Lean Cuisine or Healthy Choice – When you’re too tired to cook or in a hurry, these are life savers.

Make it more difficult to access the foods that stumble you and sabotage your efforts. Eliminate the following from your environment:\\n\\n\\uf020 Cookies, chocolate bars, pastries, candy and any high-calorie, sweetened snack foods \\uf0b7\\uf020 Salty foods such as potato chips, pretzels, taco chips, crackers, and other packaged munchies \\uf0b7\\uf020 White bread, white rolls, white buns \\uf0b7\\uf020 \\uf0b7\\uf020 Quick-fix prepared foods such as pizza, fried entrees and dinners, microwavable sandwiches \\uf0b7\\uf020 High-fat spreads and dips \\uf0b7\\uf020 Sugared soft drinks and beverages \\uf0b7\\uf020 Alcoholic beverages \\uf0b7\\uf020 Any food that can be classified as junk food or that you habitually binge on\\n\\nIce cream and high-sugar frozen deserts\\n\\nNutrition Habit #8 Avoid or Limit alcohol in your Diet\\n\\nAlthough alcohol is low in fat content, it is very high in empty calories. In addition, alcohol activates the enzyme that uptakes fat from our bloodstream and stores it in our fat cells. Therefore any food you consume in combination with alcohol will more likely end up in our fat storage depot areas like our hips, thighs and abs. And finally, alcohol lowers our inhibitions making us more likely to make poorer food choices. So practice moderation in this area please.\\n\\nNutrition Habit #9 Take a multi-vitamin everyday\\n\\nAs insurance to a healthy diet, we are going to recommend you take one multi-vitamin every day. Choose one that is as close to 100 percent of the requirements of as many of the vitamins and minerals as possible.\\n\\nYou know what they say - you are what you eat and what you put into your body. If you are serious about your health and fitness, adhere to the suggestions in this chapter. Looking good, feeling great and living life to the fullest is definitely within your reach.\\n\\n62\\n\\nSECTION SIX\\n\\nLIFESTYLE CHANGES\\n\\nOur deepest fear is not that we are inadequate.\\n\\nOur deepest fear is\\n\\nthat we are powerful beyond measure.\\n\\nIt is our light not our darkness\\n\\nthat most frightens us.\\n\\nWe ask ourselves,\\n\\nwho am I to be brilliant,\\n\\ngorgeous, talented and fabulous?\\n\\nActually, who are you not to be?\\n\\nYou are a child of God.\\n\\nYour playing small doesn’t serve the world.\\n\\nThere’s nothing enlightening about shrinking\\n\\nso that other people won’t feel insecure around you.\\n\\nWe were born to make manifest\\n\\n63\\n\\n64\\n\\nMove that Body!\\n\\nNEAT or Non-Exercise Activity Thermogenesis is the amount of calories we expend from activity that is not exercise related. Lack of time is the number one reason people say they can not participate in an exercise program. The good news is that just being active throughout the day means you do not have to spend hours at the gym! The problem is we have simply become too sedentary. The age of technology is making us fat. Escalators, elevators, remote controls, garage door openers, computers, home banking, the Internet.. The International Journal on Obesity estimates that we expend 500-800 calories less per day than we did a few decades ago. So all of the labor saving devices that are supposed to be making life easier are in fact making our health and our lives a lot worse.\\n\\nHere are some ways to increase daily caloric expenditure without actually \"exercising\": \\uf0b7\\uf020 Park one or two blocks away from wherever you’re going and walk there \\uf0b7\\uf020 Walk or cycle if your destination is less than 20 minutes away \\uf0b7\\uf020 Always park in the farthest parking stall instead of hunting for the perfect spot right in front of the shop \\uf0b7\\uf020 Take the stairs if you need to go fewer than 5 flights \\uf0b7\\uf020 Take a 10 minute walk before work, at lunch or after dinner \\uf0b7\\uf020 Schedule active outings with your family or friends (hikes, cycling, walks, swimming, kayaking, indoor\\n\\nrockclimbing)\\n\\n\\uf020 Do a few knee bends, heel raises or toe taps while making dinner \\uf0b7\\uf020 Do a few light exercises during TV commercials \\uf0b7\\uf020 At work, get up, move and stretch every 30 minutes. (Your back will thank you for it too.) \\uf0b7\\uf020 Sign up for a course (gardening, ballroom dancing, pottery); it will keep you busy and get you out of the\\n\\nhouse\\n\\nOne study at the University of South Carolina found that we expend approximately 10 calories less per day as a result of just using remote controls. 10 calories less – it does not sound like a lot. But 10 calories here and 15 calories there – it all adds up. It is easy to see how people are putting weight on so easily and so quickly. In this day and age, it is a lot easier to eat 3,500 excess calories than it is to expend 3,500 calories.\\n\\nIf you are exercising three hours per week, what are you doing the other 165 hours? How you spend the time outside of your exercise sessions will make a huge difference to your efforts and ultimately your results. Being active throughout the day will not take up any more of your time but you will end up burning more calories and feeling a lot better!\\n\\nThe Importance of Sleep: More and more literature is touting the importance of sleep in terms of health and fat loss. We now understand that when the body doesn’t get the 7-8 hours of sleep every night that it needs to rejuvenate/repair/heal, it finds ways to compensate for the lower levels of serotonin or dopamine caused by lack of sleep. It does this by increasing appetite and craving foods with sugar and fats that instantly give you the immediate release of serotonin and dopamine. It also causes you to store more fat as a defense mechanism to provide the energy to help manage the longer days. So get to bed early! Plus if you’re in bed at a decent hour, you’ll be less likely to be munching!\\n\\nManage your Stress: There has been quite a bit of research recently measuring stress hormones and how they affect our fat cells and fat metabolism. Dr. Pamela Peeke has been the leading researcher in this area and she has found that our body interprets any kind of stress in our live as physical stress and immediately responds using the \"Fight or Flight\" response. Unfortunately, most of the stress in our lives is not physical stress but rather, work, kids, financial etc - more of the emotional or mental type of stress. But nonetheless, as our stress increases, the stress hormone, cortisol, is released into the blood stream.\\n\\n65\\n\\nCortisol has two negative effects in terms of fat loss. One, it causes the body to crave more fat and sugar. And secondly, it causes the body to uptake more fat into the fat cells in order to store energy. Both act a defense mechanism to provide the body with energy to fight off the stress - unfortunately, since we\\'re not really undergoing physical stress instead, we just get fatter. Plus high levels of stress have been associated with increased risk for cardiovascular disease. The message is clear. If you want to obtain optimal health, you need to manage your stress. Take baths, get massages, write in a journal, read, pray, practice deep breathing, participate in Tai Chi, Yoga or meditation classes. Do whatever it takes to either interpret your stress differently or take care of yourself so that stress doesn\\'t tear you down.\\n\\nThink Positive and Get Healthy & Lose Fat: Thinking positive provides numerous health benefits, but did you know it will also help you lose body fat? Fat loss is a complex psychological phenomenon and can often result in a vicious cycle of weight loss and weight gain.\\n\\nFor example, if we make a conscious decision to drastically reduce our caloric intake, we will instantly experience deprivation. This will often result in feelings of anger as we question why others can eat Haagen-Daaz and chocolate and not struggle with their weight. Our will-power slowly dwindles and inevitably we give in to one of our temptations. We feel like a failure and decide, since we have screwed up, we might as well \"go for the gusto\" and binge out on all our favorites. Afterwards, we feel out of control and guilty for our actions. We feel hopeless and desperate and turn to food to comfort us. This just fuels our insecurities and low self-esteem as we start to believe we are fat, ugly and a loser. We decide the only way to feel better is to lose the weight and the cycle starts again!\\n\\nPart of initiating a fitness program is understanding the psychology of our behaviors and actions. There are lots of things we can do to gain control of our actions.\\n\\nOne aspect of gaining control is understanding the role of negative and irrational thinking. We are often our own worst critics and can be very hard on ourselves. Here are some things you might have said to yourself which might have sabotaged your efforts:\\n\\n\\uf020 \\uf0b7\\uf020 \\uf0b7\\uf020 Since I pigged out at lunch, the whole day is ruined. I might as well stuff myself today and start all over\\n\\nI missed my workout. The whole day is ruined. Why can’t I ever stick to anything? If I do not starve myself I will get fat!\\n\\nagain tomorrow!\\n\\n\\uf020 Things always go wrong! I am such a failure! \\uf0b7\\uf020 \\uf0b7\\uf020 \\uf0b7\\uf020 Once I get a six-pack then all the girls will be in love with me. I will be happy once I lose the weight! \\uf0b7\\uf020 \\uf0b7\\uf020 My thighs are the fattest I have ever seen! \\uf0b7\\uf020 \\uf0b7\\uf020 Why do I have such little will-power? \\uf0b7\\uf020 Why couldn\\'t I just have been born with a perfect body? I have got to lose 20 pounds within a month to get ready for my vacation or my holidays will be ruined! \\uf0b7\\uf020 I must never eat anything fattening! \\uf0b7\\uf020 \\uf0b7\\uf020 These things always happen to me! \\uf0b7\\uf020 \\uf0b7\\uf020\\n\\nIt is not the diet program that is wrong, it is me! I might have lost 10 pounds but I can not go to the beach until I am a perfect size six!\\n\\nIf I get skinny then my boyfriend will pay more attention to me.\\n\\nI will always be like this! I can\\'t seem to do anything right!\\n\\n66\\n\\nMany wise sayings express the effects our thinking has on our behaviors.\\n\\n\"Energy follows thought. You actually become what you think.\" Lynne Namka\\n\\n\"Change your thoughts and you change your world\" Norman V. Peale\\n\\n\"Negative thinking will always lead to failure; but positive faith – positive thinking – will lead you towards happy, healthy and abundant living.\" Albert E. Cliffe\\n\\n\"If you realized how powerful your thoughts are, you would never think a negative thought. They can have a powerful influence for good when they\\'re on the positive side, and they can and do make you physically ill when they\\'re on the negative side.\" Peace Pilgrim\\n\\nWe can not take our thoughts lightly because they can directly affect our biology, our feelings, actions and our progress. There are things that we can do immediately to overcome or control negative or irrational thinking. Here are some tips.\\n\\nMethods for overcoming negative or irrational thinking:\\n\\n1. Listen to your thoughts at the times when you feel worst. 2. Listen for irrational/negative thinking. 3. Dispute these thoughts by asking \"Why is this so?\" \"Where is this negativity coming from?\" and \"Could there be another possible explanation or interpretation?\" For example, replace negative thoughts with empowering ones such as this:\\n\\n\\uf020\\n\\nI’ve reached an expected plateau. That’s a good sign. My body is adjusting to the positive changes I’ve made. I’ll make some changes to my program to stimulate further progress\\n\\n\\uf020 As long as I continue working on my weight, I’ll achieve the goals I have set for myself. I’ll take\\n\\nconsistent action steps every day.\\n\\n\\uf020 No matter what happens, I’ll stay the course. If I do what is required, I will succeed. \\uf0b7\\uf020 Quitting will get me nowhere. I’ll analyze my schedule and make exercise a protected priority. \\uf0b7\\uf020 \\uf0b7\\uf020 \\uf0b7\\uf020 \\uf0b7\\uf020 The fitter I get, the more fun I have, and the more activities I can participate in. Life is more fun\\n\\nI feel great. I know I’m not at my goal yet but I’ve lost 20 pounds and increased my fitness level. I’ll stick to my program, a day at a time. Whatever I lose will be a positive. I am learning to love my God-given body, and I love how I feel and look.\\n\\nthan ever.\\n\\n\\uf020 Call yourself a runner, a dancer, a body builder, a health enthusiast….something with a winning\\n\\nidentity. Never think or call yourself a loser or failure.\\n\\n4. Imagine repeating what you have said to a close friend or child. We could never imagine talking to others as we often talk to ourselves. The next time you catch yourself thinking irrationally or negatively, ask yourself if you would ever speak this way to another human being. You deserve the same type of respect you would give anybody else! Remind yourself that if you continually practice negative self-talk, eventually, you may actually start to believe your own words. Your self-esteem can end up taking a real beating.\\n\\n5. Displace continuing irrational beliefs by techniques of\\n\\n\\uf020 Thought stopping. When worrying, instantly think of a stop sign and then focus on pleasant\\n\\nthoughts.\\n\\n\\uf020 Stress management. When worrying, participate in your favorite relaxation techniques like\\n\\nmassage, reading, baths, journal writing, etc.\\n\\n\\uf020 Thought reversal. Have positive messages or quotes posted around your work or home\\n\\nenvironment to help you put things into perspective.\\n\\n67\\n\\n6. Learn to live in the moment and to experience true joy in your life. Stop worrying about the past or the future. Most people have a very difficult time living in the now. Try this easy drill. Shut your eyes. Listen and try to identify all the sounds around you. Smell for different scents. Open your eyes and really look around you. Observe all the different colors and objects. The next time you eat, try to eat slowly and taste every single bite. Quick drills like this will help you to develop your skills of living in the moment.\\n\\n7. Each night before you fall asleep, make a mental note of what was the best part of your day or of\\n\\nsomething that you experienced that you really appreciated or enjoyed. By doing this, you will learn to look for the good things in life.\\n\\n8. Live today! Self-hatred takes a lot of time and energy. Obsessing about your body weight, nutrition plan and exercise program leaves you tired and depressed. Deciding to not enjoy the here-and-now because you have decided to wait until you lose the weight will leave you feeling deprived and will often lead to more negative feelings and behaviors. Remember that thin thighs, a small butt and a 6-pack set of abdominals is not the ticket to a meaningful existence. Fill your life with interesting experiences and people and you will enjoy a much higher quality of life.\\n\\nBreaking Old Habits:\\n\\nAs humans, we are creatures of habit, and often do things not because we need to but rather because it is just the way we have always done them.\\n\\nSome common examples are: \\uf0b7\\uf020 Salting your food \\uf0b7\\uf020 Eating during commercials \\uf0b7\\uf020 Always purchasing food at the movies \\uf0b7\\uf020 Eating while studying \\uf0b7\\uf020 Always over-eating at parties \\uf0b7\\uf020 Snacking while making dinner \\uf0b7\\uf020 Eating poorly when you are with friends \\uf0b7\\uf020 Always eating the same amount of food regardless of your hunger level \\uf0b7\\uf020 Stopping for an ice-cream or treat on your way home from a weekend destination regardless of your\\n\\nhunger level\\n\\nThe movies just would not be the same without popcorn! This is a habit and often, people will find themselves ordering popcorn even though they have just had dinner and are feeling quite full. Another example would be the mid-way rest-stop when coming home from the cottage or a weekend ski-trip. People will get into the habit of stopping for a Dairy Queen Blizzard or one of their other favorite treats regardless of their hunger level. Students will often get into the habit of eating while studying for exams.\\n\\nThe first step to getting control of these nutritional habits is to become aware of your patterns. A daily exercise and nutrition logbook will allow you to track your behaviors and will make patterns and habits very obvious. Once you discover what actually stimulates your less-than-healthy behavior, you have the choice of either changing the stimulus or situation or changing your response to the stimulus or situation.\\n\\nHere are the action steps you can take to overcoming habitual patterns.\\n\\nStep one: Recognize what stimulates the unhealthy action. Become aware of the habit. Monitor what you eat, when you eat, who you are with and how you felt.\\n\\nStep two: Change the stimulus\\n\\n68\\n\\nStep three: Change the response\\n\\nFor example:\\n\\nUnhealthy behavior\\n\\nChange stimulus\\n\\nChange response\\n\\nWhenever I am depressed I eat junk food\\n\\nWhenever I go out with Patti, we always drink too much and eat terribly\\n\\nEvery Friday night, friends come over to watch a rental movie and I always eat 8 slices of pizza Every time I eat ice cream, I always order a double scoop I always eat 2 sandwiches at lunch I always go to the cafeteria and buy 2 chocolate chip cookies for my mid-afternoon break\\n\\nTry not to get overly depressed, instead examine whether there could be any positive outcomes from the depressing situation. Try to develop the skills to become optimistic When you go out with Patti, bring along another friend who may be a better influence\\n\\nInstead of watching a movie, schedule a hike or a walk with your friends\\n\\nInstead of ordering ice cream, order a fruit salad Bring a bowl of chili to lunch\\n\\nTake a short walk on your break instead\\n\\nWhen you get depressed, watch a funny movie or call a best friend or go for a long walk\\n\\nYou and Patti make a healthy dinner at home and then go out dancing both agreeing that you will drink 2 glasses of water for every beer or alcoholic drink Order Japanese food instead of pizza\\n\\nOrder 1 scoop of ice cream instead of 2 Eat 1 sandwich and a small salad Bring a few fig newtons to work for your break\\n\\nLearning to Love your Body\\n\\nOften people have very unrealistic expectations of the type of body they would like to achieve. They often refer to popular magazines for an image of their ideal body. But they are ignorant of the fact that many of the models are 23 percent underweight and have been made-up for hours. Camera tricks are used and once the photos have been developed, the pictures are cropped, airbrushed and manipulated by computer to produce an unrealistic, unhealthy, and so-called \"perfect\" image. So be realistic with yourself!\\n\\n“Even I don’t wake up looking like Cindy Crawford.” Cindy Crawford\\n\\nIt is important for you to examine your genetics and to understand that fat loss is partially dependent on your genetic breakdown. Approximately 40-50 percent of \"fatness\" is genetically determined. You cannot change this! But you do have a choice. For example, if you are a pear shaped individual and everyone in your family is pear shaped, you can either choose to be an in-shape, lean, muscular pear shape or an out-of- shape, fatter pear shape, but you are always going to be a pear shape! So examine your parents and your family to determine the types of expectations you can place upon yourself. But don’t get discouraged just because your entire family struggles with weight. You still have 50% of the equation that you can control. And just because your family is overweight doesn’t mean you are destined to struggle with your weight for your entire life. It does probably mean though that you will have to work a bit harder and be a bit smarter than someone who was born to lean parents.\\n\\n69\\n\\n70\\n\\nSECTION SEVEN\\n\\nACTIVITY & NUTRITION LOGS\\n\\n“Live your life each day\\n\\nas you would climb a mountain.\\n\\nAn occasional glance toward the summit\\n\\nkeeps the goal in mind,\\n\\nbut many beautiful scenes\\n\\nare to be observed\\n\\nfrom each new vantage point”\\n\\n71\\n\\n72\\n\\nKeeping a Food and Activity Log\\n\\nStudies have shown that just the act of writing your exercise and food intake down significantly improves your habits. Also, a journal will point out bad habits or patterns that you have developed. Just noticing these slips is the first step to improving your lifestyle. Most of our clients have had a lot of success with recording their diet and activity on a daily basis and turning in their forms to their trainer to review.\\n\\nWe have supplied you with one week’s worth of logs with a summary page at the end. To continue logging, please visit our website at www.nwwomensfitness.com. Click on Services, click on Personal Training, click on Forms & Questionnaires the click on Activity and Nutrition Log. At the start of each week, print 7 copies of this form and the Weekly Synopsis, complete it each day and turn it into your trainer at the end of each week.\\n\\nYou can also utilize online Exercise and Nutrition Logs such as www.livestrong.com/myplate, www.sparkpeople.com or www.fitday.com.\\n\\nSome important points to record:\\n\\nTime of eating: Record precisely when you eat or drink anything. You may notice you either consistently eat too late, most of your calories are consumed too late in the day, you\\'re eating too few meals or that you\\'re leaving too much time between eating.\\n\\nWhat you\\'re eating and drinking: This data is very important and you are going to want to be exact and precise. It helps if you carry your log book with you so you can record your meal right after you eat. You should record every single thing you put in your mouth and exactly how much of it. Portion size is critical to help you determine where you can cut back if you need to reduce your caloric intake. Be sure to include water intake. It is helpful to do a summary at the bottom of each page that adds up exactly how many fruits, vegetables, grain servings, dairy products and glasses of water you consumed. That will help you determine on a daily basis if you\\'re meeting all your requirements.\\n\\nWhere you\\'re eating and who you\\'re eating with: You may notice that when you sit in front of the TV you always eat or eat too much. You may discover that on the weekends when you go out with friends you always overeat. You could possibly be a social eater.\\n\\nHow you are feeling during each meal: Are you bored, lonely, depressed, excited, happy, stressed out? You may determine that you are an emotional eater and will need to come up with a list of alternative activities to do when you\\'re experiencing these feelings.\\n\\nHow you are feeling after each meal: Did you overeat or eat just until you were comfortably satisfied?\\n\\nActivity Log: Record your daily exercise. You may notice that on the days you exercise you eat really well and the days you don\\'t, your nutrition is very poor.\\n\\nGoal setting: We like to encourage setting and reassessing goals on a daily basis. Everyday decide what your goal for the day will be - drink 8 glasses of water, eat 5 vegetable servings, consume 5 small meals...Pick an area that you need to focus on and then stick to it for the entire day. At the end of the day reassess your goal. Did you achieve it? Yes - Congratulations! No - Why not? What can you do tomorrow to ensure you are successful?\\n\\nDaily gratification: Include a section to record at least one thing that happened or something you saw on that day that you’re grateful for.\\n\\nWeekly Summary: At the end of the week, calculate how you did in all the important areas.\\n\\n73\\n\\nDaily Activity and Nutrition Log\\n\\nName: __________________________________________________ Date:_____________________\\n\\nExercise:\\n\\nCARDIO-VASCULAR\\n\\nMUSCLE-CONDITIONING\\n\\nFLEXIBILITY\\n\\nTime:\\n\\nTime:\\n\\nIntensity:\\n\\nIntensity:\\n\\nType:\\n\\nNutrition:\\n\\nBreakfast\\n\\nMid-morning\\n\\nLunch\\n\\nMid-afternoon\\n\\nDinner\\n\\nsnack\\n\\nsnack\\n\\nTime:\\n\\nTime:\\n\\nTime:\\n\\nTime:\\n\\nTime:\\n\\nWhat:\\n\\nWhat:\\n\\nWhat:\\n\\nWhat:\\n\\nWhat:\\n\\nLocation/\\n\\nLocation/\\n\\nLocation/\\n\\nLocation/\\n\\nLocation/\\n\\nEnvironment:\\n\\nEnvironment:\\n\\nEnvironment:\\n\\nEnvironment:\\n\\nEnvironment:\\n\\nFeelings:\\n\\nFeelings:\\n\\nFeelings:\\n\\nFeelings:\\n\\nFeelings:\\n\\nEstimated calories:\\n\\nEstimated calories:\\n\\nEstimated calories:\\n\\nEstimated calories:\\n\\nEstimated calories:\\n\\nEstimated Total Daily Calories:____________\\n\\nDid you drink 10 glasses of water today?\\n\\nYES NO\\n\\nHow many?

So how can one mere book possibly give you all of that?\\n\\nBecause this book is unlike any other fitness book ever created. Because no matter who you are, what you want, or where you happen to be standing right at this moment, the world’s greatest workout—the greatest workout for you—is now at your fingertips.\\n\\nYou see, just walking into a gym doesn’t guarantee you a great workout. It’s a lot like walking into a supermarket. Just because you fill your shopping cart with lots of great food doesn’t mean you know how to whip up a great meal. Cook all of those foods too fast, too long, or in the wrong combinations and even the freshest, most expensive\\n\\ningredients turn into slop.\\n\\nThe same thing happens in the gym: There are dozens of\\n\\nshiny machines and piles of free weights, and literally thousands of things you can do with them to build muscle and burn fat. But simply having access to a lot of equipment doesn’t mean you’ll know how to craft a great workout—one that will maximize your gains and minimize the time you spend reaching them.\\n\\nIf you’ve ever been frustrated by fitness plans in the past—or found yourself dropping out because of a lack of results, a lack of time, or because your routine called for equipment that wasn’t available on a regular basis, this book is for you. If you want to see progress immediately and feel yourself getting stronger and leaner by the day, this book is for you. If you want to take the gains you’ve reached and turbocharge them, this book is for you. If you want the perfect workout for the time you have, the equipment you have, and the goals you have, this book is for you.\\n\\nAnd most important: If you want total confidence that\\n\\nthe workout you’re doing is the absolute best possible workout, bar none, this book is for you.\\n\\nUnlike other exercise books that give you unyielding\\n\\nsystems incapable of adapting to time or equipment constraints, or that simply list hundreds of exercises but don’t tell you how to meld them into a cohesive workout, this book is different. Like a Swiss Army knife, it’s a multifaceted tool that adapts to provide you with the results you want, no matter the circumstances.\\n\\nAs the editorial director of Men’s Fitness, and the health\\n\\nand wellness editor of ABC News, I’ve tried just about every exercise plan ever created. I’ve lifted fast, I’ve lifted slow; I’ve lifted heavy, I’ve lifted light; I’ve run marathons and I’ve done wind sprints. (Although I have not, and will not, Zumba.) And I’ve spent more than 20 years reading studies and theories on building muscle, burning fat, and boosting endurance.\\n\\nBut what makes me excited about this book—what makes it so different from other exercise guides on the market—is that it guarantees you the absolute best workout no matter where you find yourself, what your goals are, or what equipment you have.\\n\\nWant the ultimate full-body fat-burning workout for the\\n\\ngym? It’s in here.\\n\\nWant the absolute best upper-body workout but have\\n\\naccess only to a pair of dumbbells? You’re covered.\\n\\nWant to shred your abs but have nothing but a pair of\\n\\ncross-trainers and a jogging trail? You’ve got the plan. Want to build muscle even while you’re trapped in a motel room or the world’s lamest hotel gym? This book takes every circumstance into consideration and gives you only the best.\\n\\nI know how good the workouts are in here because I know the team that built them: Sean Hyson, C.S.C.S., has been designing and editing workouts for the readers of Men’s Fitness and Muscle & Fitness for more than 10 years; he may well be the most knowledgeable fitness editor in the business. And I know how good the workouts are because I’ve done them myself—and they have kicked my ass. I’ve been astounded by the results!\\n\\nNow it’s time for you to build muscle, burn fat, and get into the greatest shape of your life in record time—all the while knowing that no matter where you are, no matter what equipment you have, the workout you’re doing is the absolute best workout for you, with the absolute maximum return on investment.\\n\\nGet ready to start winning.\\n\\nDavid Zinczenko\\n\\nIntroduction\\n\\nBe your best, wherever, whenever If you’re reading this book, you already appreciate the importance of working out. You know that without a regular training routine you’re not going to be your best— and let’s face it, being successful at this thing called life means constant striving to become the best you can be.\\n\\nOf course, when it comes to training—like most\\n\\neverything else in life—sometimes circumstances seem to conspire to keep you from working out. Maybe you’ll find yourself on the road without access to a gym or with access to only a really lame one. Or you might be in a situation where the only training equipment at your disposal is a TRX system, bands, or even less. Or maybe you have all the equipment you need but could use a different routine—one that shakes your body out of the complacency that results from sticking with a good thing for too long. You want to be your best, but sometimes that means making the best of a bad situation. Now, thanks to this book, you can always get a great workout—no matter where you are.\\n\\nConsider this a kind of Rosetta stone for training. No matter what kind of equipment you have (or lack thereof), or your degree of training experience, we’ve got a workout for you. In fact, we’ve got 101 of them. Your surroundings will never limit your routine again, with routines for\\n\\nbarbells, dumbbells, and even just one dumbbell. You’ll find routines that utilize suspension trainers, exercise bands, medicine balls, Swiss balls, or nothing but your body weight alone. And you’ll get to handpick from workouts that target the whole body or a program that focuses on body parts individually, along with specific workouts for the upper body and lower body. Plus, we’ve included routines for every cardio machine imaginable.\\n\\nWith this book, the coast is clear for you to get bigger, stronger, and leaner than ever, sculpting the body you’ve always wanted, regardless of your resources.\\n\\nNow, like most everything, this book has an upside and a downside. On the upside, you now have a resource that covers all your workout needs under every conceivable circumstance. The question “What kind of workout should I do?” has been answered forever. On the downside, you have no more excuses. You can’t skip sessions because you’re on the road and your hotel has a crappy, antiquated, little gym or no gym at all. Hell, you don’t even have an excuse to skip a workout if you’re lost in the arctic tundra (see this page)! You also can no longer say that you don’t have time to train, because some of these workouts require less time than an average water-cooler conversation (there’s a dedicated section of short workouts ranging from 30 minutes down to only four). This body-carving tome will fast-track your gains and\\n\\nteach you how to upgrade your current routine easily, with an incredible array of body-challenging routines. One hundred one options is a surefire plateau buster.\\n\\nNearly as diverse as the workouts within these pages are\\n\\nthe fitness experts we’ve recruited to design them, providing you with a wealth of authoritative information that has stood the test of thousands of training clients. Yet because training is only half the equation of physique transformation, we’ve also got your nutrition needs covered. Our newly erected Men’s Fitness Food Pyramid provides you with a foundation for building muscle while losing fat, employing the simplest calculations and menu plan.\\n\\nSo, as of right now, you officially have no more\\n\\nlimitations to your training—at least when it comes to location, time, and equipment. And, for better or worse, that also means no more excuses. With this book, the world becomes your gym—one that’s open 24/7, 365 days —with everything you need to build loads of quality muscle. Take advantage of your membership today and you’re guaranteed to look and feel your best for a lifetime to come.\\n\\n01 THE MEN’S FITNESS FOOD PYRAMID\\n\\nRemember the USDA Food Pyramid? The one that was posted by the lunch line in your grade school cafeteria and taught in health class? The government’s official position on how you should eat to be fit and healthy included recommendations to consume up to 11 servings of pasta, bread, and crackers per day; limit meat and eggs to three servings; and count potatoes as a vegetable.\\n\\nYeah, don’t eat like that.\\n\\nThe Food Pyramid was so misleading and inaccurate that in 2011 it was replaced with the USDA’s MyPlate, an improved but still flawed approach to fighting obesity. To be fair, the government’s nutrition advice is aimed at the average American who desires to be in only average shape (read: not obese). As we assume you picked up this book to be bigger, stronger, more ripped, and healthier than that, you need an entirely different approach.\\n\\nTo that end, we’ve created the Men’s Fitness Food Pyramid—an easy visual guide to eating for physique enhancement, performance, and optimal health. See how the pyramid works below and then use it to build a better body.\\n\\nHIT YOUR NUMBERS\\n\\nAs a physique-conscious eater, you need to think in terms of macronutrients as well as calories. Every food you eat gets counted toward a total target amount (in grams) of protein, carbs, and fat, which you can determine by multiplying the numbers in the Men’s Fitness Food Pyramid by your body weight in pounds. Hit these numbers and you’ll hit your goals.\\n\\nWith that said, your nutrition doesn’t need to be as\\n\\nprecise as target coordinates for a missile attack. You’ll do just fine eyeballing portions of protein, carbs, and fat (which we’ll show you how to do) and keeping a general tally.\\n\\nMAKE ADJUSTMENTS AS NECESSARY\\n\\nThe calorie and macronutrient recommendations here are just a starting point. Every trainee needs to find the proper amounts for his own body. If you’re not losing weight, reduce your carbs gradually, and try experimenting with bumping up your protein and fat intake a bit. If you feel as if you can’t gain weight, you can add more carbs and even more fat, which will increase your calories sharply. For any formulation you make, give it at least a week to take effect before you make any changes.\\n\\nThe M en’s F itness F ood P y ramid w as created w ith cooperation from the\\n\\nM en’s F itness N utrition A dv isory Board.

It includes John M eadow s, C .S .S .N .;\\n\\nN ate M iy aki, C .S .S .N .; C hris M ohr, P h.D.; and S helby S tarnes.\\n\\nPROTEIN\\n\\nWith protein being the main component of muscle tissue, your intake of it must remain high no matter your goal. To make size gains, you need at least one gram of protein per pound of your body weight to support optimal growth. When dieting, you must create a caloric deficit—but that can cause muscle loss if you end up cutting protein to do it. That’s why we increase protein intake and decrease starchy carbs. To get lean, you may increase your protein to as many as 1.5 grams per pound of body weight; but start lower and increase gradually as you reduce your calories slowly. If you feel like you’re not recovering from training or you’re losing muscle, up the protein fast.\\n\\nThe best protein sources are eggs, chicken, fish, lean beef, turkey, quinoa (for vegetarians), and protein powder. A three-ounce portion of lean meat or fish is about the size and thickness of the palm of your hand and contains 20–25 grams of protein, five grams of fat or fewer, and zero carbs.\\n\\nCARBS\\n\\nAll carbohydrates break down into glucose, raising your blood sugar levels faster than any other nutrient. As a result, the pancreas releases insulin to remove surplus sugar from the bloodstream and maintain normal levels. Research, including a study at the University of Washington School of Medicine, has found that exercise— particularly strength training—increases insulin sensitivity in the muscles. So if you’ve just worked out, more of the\\n\\ncarbs you eat afterward will be carried by insulin directly to your muscles for replenishment. (Incidentally, this goes for protein too, which is why it’s helpful to consume a mixture of protein and carbs after training—we’ll discuss this more later.) On the other hand, if you’ve been sitting on the couch watching football, those carbs will just get stored around your waist.\\n\\nFor this reason, we recommend that most of your carbs\\n\\ncome before, during, and shortly after training. It also means that you need to eat fewer carbs when you want to get lean—you need to keep insulin levels low. “If someone is in fat-loss mode,” says John Meadows, C.S.S.N., a nutrition coach and national-level bodybuilder, “I like to limit carbs to pre-, intra-, and post-workout meals, when they’ll go where you want them”—that is, to muscle tissue. For muscle gain, Meadows prefers to add carbs (shakes included) to meals around training time first, before adding them to other meals.\\n\\nCarb foods include potatoes, sweet potatoes, rice, oats, fruits, and vegetables. Fruits should be consumed in their whole-food form and limited to two or three pieces daily (excess fructose, the sugar in fruit, is stored as fat). Green vegetables can be eaten steadily regardless of the goal. Eat one gram of carbohydrate per pound of your body weight when dieting and two grams per pound when you want to put on muscle.\\n\\nA fist-size portion of cooked rice or potatoes is about\\n\\none cup and gives you 40–45 grams of carbs and negligible protein and fat.\\n\\nFAT\\n\\n“We need to provide a baseline level of good fats for hormone production,” says Nate Miyaki, C.S.S.N., a nutrition consultant and bodybuilder in San Francisco, CA. Fat, particularly the much-maligned saturated kind, helps in the creation of testosterone, which does everything from getting you big and lean to keeping your “little friend” ready to say hello. Contrary to popular opinion, when dieting, you don’t need to drop your fat intake much, if at all; fat loss comes fastest when carbohydrate intake is reduced. Plus, fat is satiating as well as a good source of energy.\\n\\nMost of your fats should come by way of your protein foods, but avocados, nuts, seeds, and a small amount of oil like coconut and olive oil can be included as well. Aim for 0.4 grams per pound of your body weight daily to start. One tablespoon of any oil is about 15 grams of fat, and one cup of almonds or peanuts has 70 grams of fat. Two tablespoons of nut butter is about the length of your thumb and contains 15–20 grams of fat.\\n\\nWORKOUT NUTRITION\\n\\nResearch hasn’t yet clarified the optimal amount of protein or carbs you should eat around workouts for the maximum benefit. But it is clear that some is better than none, and the presence of both is crucial. A 2006 study in the European Journal of Applied Physiology gave male subjects one of the following to consume after weight training: a 6 percent carbohydrate solution, six grams of\\n\\namino acids (components of protein), a combination of both, or a placebo. Those drinking the carb-and-aminos shake experienced greater muscle gains than any of the other groups, which the researchers presumed was because the concoction did the most to reduce muscle protein breakdown after training.\\n\\nMeadows recommends taking in 25–50 grams of\\n\\nprotein, 25–35 grams of carbs, and 10 grams of fat before training. Afterward, consume another 20–40 grams of protein and 40–80 grams of carbs—you can begin chugging this shake during the workout as well to limit muscle breakdown even further, though this may not be necessary and could upset your stomach. We like to make shakes with whey isolate or hydrolysate as the protein source, and Vitargo or highly branched cyclic dextrin for carbs.\\n\\nIf powders and shakes aren’t in your budget, Miyaki says you can go old-school and eat fruit pre- and post-workout. One or two pieces should provide enough carbs to halt muscle breakdown. And a lean three-ounce slice of protein to accompany it is fine.\\n\\nA PERFECT DAY How to plan your eating to achieve your goals\\n\\nLet’s say you’re a\\n\\n180 POUND MAN who wants to lose his gut.\\n\\nYou could start your diet eating about\\n\\n2,100 CALORIES DAILY (180 × 12)\\n\\nconsisting of 180g PROTEIN, 180g CARBS, and 70g FAT.\\n\\nHERE’S A LOW-STRESS EATING PLAN TO FIT THIS GUY’S BUSY SCHEDULE.\\n\\nBREAKFAST\\n\\n8 oz black coffee\\n\\n3 scrambled eggs\\n\\n1/3 cup unsweetened oatmeal with cinnamon\\n\\nPOST-WORKOUT\\n\\n25g whey protein\\n\\n1 banana\\n\\nLUNCH\\n\\n3 oz grilled salmon\\n\\nLarge raw salad w/ 2 tbsp olive oil and vinegar 1 cup sweet potato or white potato (cooked)\\n\\nDINNER\\n\\n6 oz baked chicken breast\\n\\n1 cup jasmine rice or potato (cooked)\\n\\nSteamed broccoli\\n\\nSNACK\\n\\nMeal-replacement shake with 50g protein, 25g carbs, 5g fat\\n\\nDESSERT\\n\\n2 tbsp almond butter mixed with one scoop chocolate casein protein and water (to make a pudding)\\n\\n02 HOW TO WARM UP\\n\\nWe’ll keep this brief. When you’re eager to work out, the last thing you want to do is slow your roll with a long warmup that has you flopping around the floor like a fish, draining your momentum. If you passed fifth grade P.E., you’ve already had it drilled into you that warming up is crucial and not to be skipped, so we’ll spare you the speech about howimportant it is. Instead of lecturing, we’ll give you some warmup options that get you sweating and ready to perform any of the workouts that follow, but also fit into the time you have and your level of patience—whatever the case may be. Most important is that you don’t start lifting heavy weights, jumping, or running totally cold, which common sense should tell you is an injury waiting to happen.\\n\\nOPTION 1 THE BEST WARMUP\\n\\nIf you have at least an hour in which to train, or a history of injuries that could otherwise impede your ability to train safely, your warmup should begin with foam rolling and include a wide array of dynamic exercises and static stretches.\\n\\nIf you’ve tried a foam roller after a tough workout, you were instantly aware of its ability to help relieve muscle aches and soreness. It also provides an easy way to start getting warmed up, as it promotes blood flow. Rest your muscles on the roller (a tennis ball, softball, or lacrosse ball work, too) and roll them out for about 30 seconds each. When you find a tender spot, hold the position until you feel it begin to release (or for as long as you can stand it). Pay extra attention to the hips, glutes, outer and inner thighs, lower back, calves, and lats. You can repeat the rolling after your workout as well if you like, as this may enhance recovery.\\n\\nA)\\n\\nB) fuzzy). This could be a set of 30 jumping jacks, a five- minute walk on the treadmill (set to a slight incline), or a\\n\\nPerform some light activity that elevates your heart rate and makes you feel warm (though not necessarily\\n\\nminute or two of jumping rope. Other cardio machines like a stationary bike or an elliptical machine can also get your blood flowing.\\n\\nNow you’ll begin what’s often called a dynamic C) warmup. In addition to encouraging further blood flow and higher body temperature, dynamic exercises take your muscles through the ranges of motion you’ll use in your workout, preparing you to get into those positions safely. There are endless options, but try this routine.\\n\\n1 SHOULDER OVER AND BACK\\n\\nPERFORM 15 REPS\\n\\nHold a band, dowel, yardstick, or light bar in front of your hips with hands outside shoulder width. Keeping your elbows straight, raise your arms overhead and behind your body as far as you can. Bring them back in front of you again. Continue going over and back and gradually narrow your grip as you feel your shoulders loosen up.\\n\\n2 HIP HINGE\\n\\nPERFORM 15 REPS\\n\\nPlace your hands on your hips and stand with feet hip width. Push your hips back, bending your knees only as needed, until you feel a stretch in your hamstrings. Squeeze your glutes as you forcefully push your hips forward again to stand up straight.\\n\\n3 OVERHEAD SQUAT\\n\\nPERFORM 10 REPS\\n\\nHold a band, dowel, yardstick, or light bar overhead with hands outside shoulder width. Stand with feet shoulder width and toes turned out slightly. Bend your hips back and squat as low as you can without letting your tailbone tuck under. Keep the object you’re holding above and slightly behind your head the whole time—don’t let it drift in front of you.\\n\\n4 SIDE LUNGE\\n\\nPERFORM 10 REPS ON EA CH LEG\\n\\nStand with feet hip width and step out to your left. Lower your body until your left knee is bent 90 degrees, or until you feel a stretch in the right side of your groin, but keep your right leg straight. Repeat on the right side.\\n\\n5 BENTOVER YTW\\n\\nPERFORM 8 REPS OF EA CH\\n\\nStand with feet shoulder width and bend your hips back, keeping your lower back flat, until your torso is about 45 degrees to the floor. Let your arms hang. Now squeeze your shoulder blades together and raise your arms up and out to your sides about 45 degrees to form a Y shape. Lower them and then raise them out to your sides 90 degrees to form a T. Lower and then raise them out to your sides, but bend your elbows 90 degrees to form a W.\\n\\n6 CAT/CAMEL\\n\\nPERFORM 10 REPS\\n\\nKneel on the floor with knees under your hips and hands beneath your shoulders. Arch your back so your chest rises—you should look like a cat stretching. Now round your entire back so it looks like a camel’s hump.\\n\\n7 BIRD DOG\\n\\nPERFORM 10 REPS ON EA CH SIDE\\n\\nFrom the kneeling position, extend your left hand out in front of you. Simultaneously kick your right leg back straight, bracing your core and squeezing your glutes as you do so. Hold for a moment and then switch legs.\\n\\n8 HIP CIRCLE\\n\\nMA KE 10 CLOCKWISE CIRCLES A ND THEN SWITCH LEGS; REPEA T ON BOTH LEGS IN THE COUNTERCLOCKWISE DIRECTION\\n\\nFrom the kneeling position, raise your right knee off the floor and make circles with it, opening your hip as much as possible on each revolution. Keep your shoulders square to the floor.\\n\\n9 GROINER\\n\\nPERFORM 10 REPS ON EA CH SIDE\\n\\nGet into pushup position with your hands shoulder width, feet close together, and body in a straight line. Jump your left foot forward and land it to the outside of your left hand. Let your hips sink a bit to feel the stretch and then reverse it—jump your left foot back while the right one comes up to your right hand.\\n\\nD)At this point, it’s wise to statically stretch muscles\\n\\nthat you know to be chronically tight. For most\\n\\npeople, the hips, glutes, and lats are bound up due to many hours sitting at desks in front of computers, but stretch whatever areas you feel need it most. Hold each stretch for 30 seconds and repeat for three sets on each side. The following are some suggestions.\\n\\nHIP FLEXOR STRETCH\\n\\nGet into lunge position on the floor with your right leg back. Place your hands on your hips and push your hips forward until you feel a stretch in your right hip. Squeeze your glutes on your right side. For a more intense stretch, reach your right arm overhead and lean back slightly while keeping your hips forward. Another progression is to reach back and grasp the outside of your rear foot and gently pull it off the floor. You’ll feel the stretch go into the top of your thigh.\\n\\nLAT STRETCH\\n\\nGrasp a sturdy upright object with your left hand, thumb facing up, and bend your hips back until your torso and arm are in line and you feel a stretch in your lat. Move gently from side to side so you stretch the entire muscle.\\n\\nPEC STRETCH\\n\\nPlace the meat of your right forearm against a sturdy upright object (a doorframe is perfect) and bend your elbow 90 degrees. Gently lean forward so you feel a stretch on your pec.\\n\\nPIRIFORMIS STRETCH\\n\\nSit on a bench and cross your left leg over your right knee, bending your left knee 90 degrees. Gently push your left knee down so you feel a stretch on the outside of your left glutes.\\n\\nCALF STRETCH\\n\\nPlace your hands against a wall and stagger your feet so one is close to the wall and your rear leg is straight. Both feet face forward and your rear leg should be aligned with your upper body. Lean forward until you feel your calf stretch on your trailing leg.\\n\\nOPTION 2 THE MEATHEAD’S WARMUP\\n\\nMost guys come into the gym and grasp the bar or a pair of dumbbells and do a light set of 15–20 reps. Then they go a little heavier and cut the reps down a bit. They’ll do one more set and, now that they’re sweating, figure they’re ready to go.\\n\\nWhile this is hardly the best way to prep your body, it does serve the purpose most of the time, assuming you’re not training too heavy. But take it a little slower and more deliberately, and you’ve got a more decent warmup routine for when you’re doing one of our lifting workouts and need to get done in a hurry.\\n\\nHere’s how to warm up for a heavy strength workout that begins with a barbell exercise. More accurately, this is called “working up” in powerlifting circles, because the goal is to gradually work your way up to using the heaviest weights possible. You start with the empty bar and perform 10–15 reps with perfect form and then add weight in moderate increments until you’re at the maximum load you plan to lift on the exercise.\\n\\nHere’s how it might look for a guy work ing up to a 275-pound squat\\n\\nfor fiv e reps:\\n\\nThere’s no exact formula for how to do this, so the weights and reps above aren’t mandatory, but the idea is to start very light, pump some blood into the working muscles and lubricate the joints, and then add weight steadily until you comfortably arrive at the heaviest load you can use for the target reps. The reps on these work-up sets are kept low (after the first set or two) because you need to conserve energy for the main effort, the work set. These sets also serve to reinforce good technique, so the form on the exercise is fresh in your mind and the body is in its groove to do it properly when you get to a challenging load.\\n\\nHow long should you rest between sets? Since work-up sets aren’t as taxing as your main work sets, you shouldn’t need to rest long. A minute or so will be fine for most until you get up to heavy weights, at which time you can rest longer.\\n\\nThere are a few tricks you can employ to make this process even more effective and make your top set even heavier, or at least feel easier. Try doing your last work-up set a little heavier than the main set, but only for one or two reps, so it’s not too strenuous. Then back down to the weight you intend to use for the work set.\\n\\nFor instance, if y ou’re going to perform a squat with 275 for fiv e, y our last four sets could look lik e this:\\n\\nIn other words, you gradually work up to an even heavier weight, reducing your reps to minimize fatigue, and then go back down to 275. The set with 300 might be way more than you can handle for five reps, but done for only one, it will feel relatively easy. By comparison, 275 will feel much easier when it’s done afterward. Obviously, this won’t work on super-heavy sets when your target reps are in the 1–3 range, but it’s great when they’re between 4 and 8.\\n\\nAnother trick, which we learned from Jason Ferruggia, a\\n\\nstrength coach in Los Angeles, CA, is to back the weight down for a set before you reach your target. This works well if you’re trying to hit a new max (one rep), which can be very intimidating. The weight tends to feel very heavy at around 90 percent of your max, and it can dissuade you from going any heavier. By going a bit lighter for a set and then working your way back up, you give your nervous system more time to adapt. The weight feels lighter, so you feel more confident, and the rest of the way up to your max weight goes smoother.\\n\\nSay y ou’re try ing to bench press 315 for the first time. Your last few sets could dev elop lik e this:\\n\\nTo be clear, working up is not optional. Because it can be time consuming, if you have time for only one kind of warmup, this should be it. But we strongly suggest that, whenever possible, you employ one of the other options we list here beforehand.\\n\\nIncidentally, working up applies to training with\\n\\nkettlebells/dumbbells, a suspension trainer, and bands as well. Start with light resistance, gradually tapering your reps as you up the intensity.\\n\\nOPTION 3 THE PRACTICAL WARMUP\\n\\nAs the name implies, this routine is for when you have time to warm up, but not enough to do everything listed in Option 1. In this case, you need to get a good sweat going and prepare your muscles and joints to move while doing the bare essentials.\\n\\nAccording to Ben Bruno, a celebrity trainer at Rise Movement in West Hollywood, CA, you should hit a cardio machine for five minutes followed by these stretches. “Do toe-touch squats and sumo squat holds (both of which are explained below) to improve mobility,” Bruno says.\\n\\nTOE-TOUCH SQUAT\\n\\nStand with feet shoulder width and toes turned slightly out. Reach down to touch your toes with legs extended and then bend your hips back to squat down, keeping your lower back in its natural arch. Now reach your hands overhead and come up.\\n\\nSUMO SQUAT HOLD\\n\\nStand with feet shoulder width and toes turned slightly out. Bend your hips back and squat down, keeping your lower back flat and reaching your hands to your toes in the bottom position. Hold the position for a few seconds and then use your elbows to push your knees farther apart so you can sink deeper into the squat.\\n\\nDID WE SAY THIS WOULD BE BRIEF?\\n\\nIn a nutshell, that’s all you need to know about warming up. Note that even if you’re doing a lower-body workout, it’s smart to include some upper-body warmup moves because the entire body is connected. Tightness or coldness in the upper torso can lead to injury when working the legs, and vice versa; so while you may abbreviate or recombine the warmup moves listed here, don’t ignore whole muscle areas just because you’re not training them that day. For the cardio routines beginning in chapter 26, you don’t need to do any more warming up than what is already built into the workouts.\\n\\n03 FULL GYM\\n\\nWe all love to bitch about our gyms. They don’t have enough benches, the machines are always broken, and so on. It’s only when we’re forced to train at home or in a hotel that we realize what a luxury even the most average commercial fitness center is.\\n\\nIf you’re lucky enough to have a membership to a training facility, this chapter is for you. Or, if you’ve put together a well-stocked home gym, this is where you should start as well. While it may not be the fitness paradise you crave, it almost certainly has all the tools you need to build a great body. The workouts that follow will show you how to take advantage of them.\\n\\nWe’re assuming your gym has barbells, dumbbells, a powerrack, adjustable benches, cables, Swiss balls, and pullup bars. With that much inventory, you can easily complete the various options of workouts we outline for you. These include three distinct routines for gaining muscle, two for losing fat, and two for body recomposition —workouts that hit the magical combination of both muscle gain and fat loss to reshape your physique with minimal change in body weight.\\n\\nTHE BEST BODY- RECOMPOSITION WORKOUT [option A] WORKOUT #1 BY JOE DOWDELL, C.S.C.S.\\n\\nWe can’t ov erstate the aw esomeness of G erman engineering. The\\n\\nland that brought us jet planes, the M ercedes, and H eidi Klum also\\n\\nintroduced perhaps the best method of body recomposition know n to the\\n\\nfitness industry —that is, a timeless strategy to gain muscle and lose body fat\\n\\nsimultaneously . A chtung!\\n\\nHOW IT WORKS\\n\\nH ala Rambie, a scientist w ho defected to West G ermany during the C old War,\\n\\nfound that fat loss could be accelerated by raising lev els of blood lactate—an\\n\\nenergy substrate. M ore lactate corresponds to greater release of grow th\\n\\nhormone, w hich tells y our body to grow muscle and burn flab.\\n\\nThe best way to raise lactate quickly is to pair upper- and lower-body exercises, or opposing movements, for reps in the 8–15 range. The sweet spot for sets is three, and rest periods are restricted to 30–60 seconds. This approach has since become known as German Body Comp.\\n\\nDIRECTIONS\\n\\nA lternate sets of “A ” and “B” exercises. S o y ou’ll do a set of A , rest, then a\\n\\nset of B, rest again, and so on for all the prescribed sets. The remaining\\n\\nexercises are done as straight sets.\\n\\nTo increase the intensity, decrease your rest between sets by 15 seconds every two weeks. Start by resting 60 seconds for the first two weeks. Then in Weeks 3 and 4, rest 45 seconds, and so on.\\n\\nTEMPO\\n\\nE ach exercise is assigned a tempo.\\n\\n(A “0” indicates no time—simply mov e on to the next digit.) F or example, a\\n\\nfront squat w ith a tempo of 3110 w ould be done like so: Take three seconds\\n\\nto low er y ourself into the squat. P ause for one second at the bottom. Take\\n\\none second to come back up to standing, and then go right back into the\\n\\ndescent.\\n\\n1A DEADLIFT\\n\\nSETS: 3 REPS: 8–10 TEMPO: 4010 REST: 60 SEC.\\n\\nStand with your feet hip width. Bend your hips back to reach down and grasp the bar, hands just outside your knees. Keeping your lower back in its natural arch, drive your heels into the floor and pull the bar up along your shins until you’re standing with hips fully extended and the bar is in front of your thighs.\\n\\n1B 1¼ NEUTRAL-GRIP DUMBBELL BENCH PRESS\\n\\nSETS: 3 REPS: 8–10 TEMPO: 3020 REST: 60 SEC.\\n\\nLie back on a flat bench with a dumbbell in each hand. Turn your wrists so your palms face each other. Press the weights over your chest and then lower back down. Come back up one quarter of the way, and then down again. Now press up to lockout once more. That’s one rep. Take three seconds to lower the weights down from the lockout position, and two seconds when pressing to lockout.\\n\\n2A BULGARIAN SPLIT SQUAT\\n\\nSETS: 3 REPS: 8–10 (EA CH SIDE) TEMPO: 3110 REST: 60 SEC.\\n\\nStand lunge-length in front of a bench. Hold a dumbbell in each hand and rest the top of your left foot on the bench behind you. Lower your body until your rear knee nearly touches the floor and your front thigh is parallel to the floor.\\n\\n2B INVERTED ROW\\n\\nSETS: 3 REPS: 10–12 TEMPO: 2011 REST: 60 SEC.\\n\\nSet a barbell in a power rack (or use a Smith machine) at about hip height. Lie underneath it and grasp it with hands about shoulder-width apart. Hang from the bar so your body forms a straight line. Squeeze your shoulder blades together and pull yourself up until your back is fully contracted.\\n\\n3A DIP\\n\\nSETS: 3 REPS: 10–12 TEMPO: 3110 REST: 60 SEC.\\n\\nSuspend yourself over the bars of a dip station and lower your body until your upper arms are parallel to the floor.\\n\\n3B SEATED INCLINE DUMBBELL CURL\\n\\nSETS: 3 REPS: 10–12 TEMPO: 4010 REST: 60 SEC.\\n\\nSet an adjustable bench between 45 and 60 degrees and sit back against it with a dumbbell in each hand. Curl the weights to shoulder height without allowing your elbows to drift in front of your shoulders.\\n\\n4 SWISS BALL ROLLOUT\\n\\nSETS: 3 REPS: 10–15 TEMPO: 2020 REST: 60 SEC.\\n\\nKneel on the floor and rest your forearms on a Swiss ball. Keeping your core braced, roll the ball forward so your arms are extended. Stop before your lower back begins to sag. Roll yourself back.\\n\\nTHE BEST BODY- RECOMPOSITION WORKOUT [option B] WORKOUT #2 BY JOE DOWDELL, C.S.C.S.\\n\\nU se this routine just as y ou did the prev ious one—Body -\\n\\nRecomposition O ption A .

Grasp the bar with hands at shoulder width and raise your elbows until your upper arms are parallel to the floor. Take the bar out of the rack and let it rest on your fingertips—as long as your elbows stay up, you’ll be able to balance the bar. Step back and set your feet at shoulder width with toes turned out slightly. Squat as low as you can without losing the arch in your lower back.\\n\\n1B NEUTRAL-GRIP CHINUP\\n\\nSETS: 3 REPS: 8–10 TEMPO: 4010 REST: 60 SEC.\\n\\nUse a chinup bar that has handles so you can grasp it with your palms facing each other (if you have only a straight bar, hook a V-grip cable handle over it, or use a suspension trainer as shown). Hang from the handles and then pull yourself up until your chin is over them.\\n\\n2A ROMANIAN DEADLIFT\\n\\nSETS: 3 REPS: 8–10 TEMPO: 3110 REST: 60 SEC.\\n\\nHold a barbell with a shoulder-width grip and stand with feet hip width.

Stand with feet shoulder width apart, perpendicular to the anchor point, and arms extended, far enough away from the machine so there’s tension on the cable. Twist away from the machine as if you were chopping into a tree. Keep your feet stationary.\\n\\n2A DEADLIFT\\n\\nSETS: 3–5 REPS: 6 REST: 0 SEC.\\n\\nStand with feet about hip-width apart. Bend your hips back to reach down and grasp the bar so your hands are just outside your knees. Keeping your lower back in its natural arch, drive your heels into the floor and pull the bar up along your shins until you’re standing with hips fully extended and the bar is in front of your thighs.\\n\\n2B BENTOVER ROW\\n\\nSETS: 3–5 REPS: 6 REST: 0 SEC.\\n\\nGrasp the bar overhand at shoulder width and let it hang in front of your thighs. Bend at the hips and lower your torso until it’s nearly parallel to the floor. Bend your knees a bit to take tension off your hamstrings. Squeeze your shoulder blades together and pull the bar to your belly.\\n\\n2C HANG CLEAN\\n\\nSETS: 3–5 REPS; 6 REST: 0 SEC.\\n\\nHold the bar at shoulder width in front of your thighs and bend your hips and knees so that the bar lowers to just above your knees. Now explosively extend your hips as if jumping while at the same time shrugging your shoulders and pulling the bar straight up in front of your torso. As the bar reaches chest level, bend your elbows so that your palms face the ceiling and catch the bar at shoulder level, upper arms parallel to the floor. Bend your hips and knees as you catch the bar to absorb the impact and then stand up straight.\\n\\n2D PUSH PRESS\\n\\nSETS: 3–5 REPS: 6 REST: 90 SEC.\\n\\nHold the bar at shoulder level.

Hang from the bar and then pull yourself up until your chin is over it.\\n\\n04 BARBELL\\n\\nBecause of its association with bench pressing, squatting, and deadlifting, the barbell tends to be thought of as a tool that’s good only for performing specific lifts or hitting one muscle group at a time. In later chapters we’ll show you how to get great workouts for any body part with a barbell alone, but here we’ve got routines that work your whole body.\\n\\nYou don’t necessarily need a bench, a rack, or even two matched plates to get a good workout with a barbell. A corner of a room in which you can wedge one end can be enough. And if you use the Olympic lifts—the exercises contested in Olympic weightlifting competitions—you can hit every major muscle of the body in minutes. These are just two of the approaches you’re about to discover.\\n\\nTHE BEST BARBELL-ONLY WORKOUT [option A] WORKOUT #8 BY JOE STANKOWSKI, C.P.T.\\n\\nIf y ou train at home or any w here else that prov ides only a barbell\\n\\nand a small amount of w eight, y ou can make the most of it by\\n\\nspeeding or slow ing y our reps and performing y our exercises circuit-sty le.\\n\\nHOW IT WORKS\\n\\nThe barbell w as inv ented to carry balanced loads but w orks just as w ell out\\n\\nof balance. The follow ing exercises can be performed w ith one end w edged\\n\\nbetw een tw o w alls w hile y ou lift the other end like a lev er.

If an exercise feels easy using the load y ou hav e av ailable, perform\\n\\ny our reps slow er and w ith more control. (O r, if y ou hav e extra w eight, load\\n\\nit.) A nother option is to choke dow n on the bar. G ripping it low er w ill decrease\\n\\ny our mechanical adv antage and make the exercise harder.\\n\\nAfter the last exercise, rest two minutes and then repeat the entire circuit. Continue for 20 minutes. You\\n\\ncan repeat the workout up to four times per week, resting a day between sessions.\\n\\n1 SPLIT SQUAT TO PRESS\\n\\nREPS: 10–12 (EA CH SIDE) REST: 0 SEC.\\n\\nWedge the end of the barbell into a corner of the room (to avoid damage to the walls, you may have to wrap a towel around it). Load the opposite end with a weight plate and grasp it toward the end. Get into a lunge position with your left leg in front, bent to where your thigh is parallel to the floor and your right knee nearly touches the floor. Stand up explosively and press the bar straight up.\\n\\n2 SINGLE-ARM ROW W/ PARTIAL LUNGE\\n\\nREPS: 10–12 (EA CH SIDE) REST: 0 SEC.\\n\\nHold the barbell behind the sleeve (where you load the weights) with your left hand. Get into a lunge position but not deep—keep both legs slightly extended so that the bar and plate don’t brush the floor. Draw your shoulder blade back and row the bar to your ribs.\\n\\n3 BARBELL RUSSIAN TWIST\\n\\nREPS: 10–12 (EA CH SIDE) REST: 0 SEC.\\n\\nGrasp the bar near the very end again—this time with both hands.

Lower yourself until your left thigh is parallel to the floor and your rear knee nearly touches the floor.\\n\\n05 DUMBBELLS & KETTLEBELLS\\n\\nEver since the reemergence of the kettlebell as a training staple about a decade ago, there’s been a debate over which is superior, dumbbells or kettlebells. While this argument is pretty much a stalemate, we’ll take kettlebells.\\n\\nFor one, kettlebells have thicker handles, so your grip and forearms are recruited more heavily. For another, the bell hangs at a distance from the handle, so the load is offset, which makes every move more difficult to stabilize and more demanding of your core to provide that stability. Furthermore, just about any exercise you can think to do with a dumbbell can be replicated with a kettlebell and will feel much harder.\\n\\nBut, hey, people have been getting ripped sans kettlebells for years, so if dumbbells are all you have, forget what you read above. Dumbbells tend to take up less space and are a little more convenient to store, and they’re certainly more common and easy to find, so you might as well learn how to make the most of them. This chapter explores your options when training\\n\\nconditions are most dire—when you have access only to embarrassingly light weights, mismatched weights, or even just one weight. All the workouts that follow can be performed with either dumbbells or kettlebells. Or, a single bell, as the case may be.\\n\\nTHE BEST TWO- DUMBBELL/KETTLEBELL WORKOUT [option A] WORKOUT #10 BY JOE STANKOWSKI, C.P.T.\\n\\nWhether y ou’re v isiting relativ es or in a hotel w ith an underw helming\\n\\n“fitness center,” there may come a time w hen all y ou hav e access to\\n\\nis a measly pair of dumbbells or kettlebells. N ot a problem, now that y ou\\n\\nhav e this routine.\\n\\nHOW IT WORKS\\n\\nIn this situation, the load y ou hav e w ill be more appropriate for some\\n\\nexercises than others. To see that y ou get the most out of the w orkout w e\\n\\nprescribe here, w hatev er the poundage y ou hav e to w ork w ith, y ou’ll need to\\n\\nadjust the speed of y our reps. A pair of 25-pound dumbbells, for example,\\n\\nprobably w on’t be challenging on exercises such as the stepup. In this case,\\n\\nperform y our reps more slow ly to test y our endurance and build muscle\\n\\ncontrol. O n other exercises, like the bentov er lateral raise, 25 pounds may be\\n\\njust right or a bit heav y , so perform y our reps explosiv ely .\\n\\nIf you should happen to have two unevenly weighted dumbbells, such as a 25-pounder and a 15-pounder, don’t be discouraged. Simply switch the weights in your hands each time you repeat the circuit. Asymmetrical loads force\\n\\nyour core to stabilize you even more on each exercise.\\n\\nDIRECTIONS\\n\\nP erform the exercises as a circuit, completing one set of each in turn w ithout\\n\\nrest. A fter the last exercise, rest tw o minutes and then repeat. C ontinue for 20\\n\\nminutes.

Hold the dumbbell in your right hand. Raise your hips up so that your body forms a straight line and brace your abs—your weight should be on your left forearm and the edge of your left foot. From this position, raise the weight in your right hand until your arm is parallel to the floor. If the dumbbell or kettlebell you have is too heavy to perform a lateral raise with in this position, you can use a weight plate from the dumbbell (if it’s the plate-loaded kind), or simply skip the lateral raise and use the weight to resist your side plank.\\n\\n2 SINGLE-LEG ROMANIAN DEADLIFT\\n\\nSETS: A S MA NY A S POSSIBLE REPS: 10–12 (EA CH SIDE) REST: 0 SEC.\\n\\nHold a dumbbell in one hand and stand on the opposite leg.

MURPHY, M.F.S.\\n\\nA s trendy as kettlebells hav e become, many chain gy ms don’t offer\\n\\nenough that y ou can be sure y ou’ll get a matching pair at a giv en time\\n\\n(especially if that time is during peak hours). Your best bet then is to do w hat\\n\\ny ou can w ith a single kettlebell.\\n\\nIncidentally, if you train at home and have just one\\n\\ndumbbell that you’ve been using as a paperweight up until now, this workout applies equally to you (kettlebells and dumbbells can be used interchangeably).\\n\\nHOW IT WORKS\\n\\nO ne bell offers a distinct set of benefits from a pair. Your body w ill hav e to\\n\\ncompensate for the imbalance by recruiting y our core muscles more intensely ,\\n\\nand w orking one side at a time w ill make for longer sets w ith a greater\\n\\ncardiov ascular demand. Done as a circuit, the exercises that follow raise y our\\n\\nheart rate ev en further, making this w orkout a great adjunct to a strict diet for\\n\\nfat loss.\\n\\nDIRECTIONS\\n\\nThe w orkout consists of tw o circuits. In C ircuit 1, y ou’ll perform the exercises\\n\\nin sequence for six reps each. C omplete as many rounds as possible in six\\n\\nminutes, and then rest one minute. Repeat tw ice more and then rest tw o\\n\\nminutes before beginning C ircuit 2.\\n\\nCIRCUIT 1\\n\\n1 ONE-ARM SNATCH\\n\\nREPS: 6 (EA CH SIDE) REST: 0 SEC.\\n\\nHold a kettlebell in front of your thighs with your right hand and stand with feet between hip and shoulder width. Keep your torso as upright as possible and bend your knees until the weight hangs at mid-shin level— maintain the arch in your lower back. Jump, extending your hips explosively, and raise the weight straight up your body. When it gets to your chest, flip your wrist and “catch” the bell overhead with arm extended.\\n\\n2 KETTLEBELL PRESS-OUT\\n\\nREPS: 6 REST: 0 SEC.\\n\\nHold the weight close to your chest at shoulder level with both hands on the handle and palms facing each other. Squat down as deeply as you can and then press the bell straight out in front of you with arms extended. Bring it back to your chest and repeat for reps while maintaining the squat position.\\n\\n3 HARD-STYLE KETTLEBELL SWING\\n\\nREPS: 6 REST: 0 SEC.\\n\\nStand with feet hip-width apart and the weight on the floor. Grasp the kettlebell with both hands (palms facing you) and, keeping your lower back flat, extend your hips to raise it off the floor. From there, take a deep breath and bend your hips back, allowing the weight to swing back between your legs. Explosively extend your hips and exhale—allowing the momentum to swing the weight up to shoulder level. Control the descent, but use the momentum to begin the next rep.\\n\\nCIRCUIT 2\\n\\nTURKISH GETUP\\n\\nLie on your back on the floor holding a kettlebell with your right hand over your chest, arm perpendicular to the floor. Bend your right knee 90 degrees and plant your foot on the floor. Brace your abs and raise your torso off the floor. Use your left hand for support. Now use your right foot to raise your hips off the floor. Sweep your left leg back and rest on your left knee. Come up to a standing position, and then reverse the motion to return to the floor. Note that the foot that rests on the floor changes with the hand that’s holding the weight (when you perform the getup with the left hand, your left foot will lie flat). Perform one rep with the weight in your right hand and then immediately switch hands and repeat. Switch back to your right hand and do two reps. Then do two on your left. Continue adding one extra rep in this fashion until you’re up to five on each side. Without rest, reverse the process and work back down to one rep.\\n\\n06 MACHINES\\n\\nWe’ve never been big fans of machines at Men’s Fitness. For most people, they represent taking the path of least resistance—literally. Machines determine your range of motion and the way your muscles move the weight, so you don’t train your body to do these things. If you’re just getting into lifting and want to gain weight and get stronger, machines aren’t the best way to go. But if you’re older and have nagging injuries, or you want to isolate one muscle at a time to bring it up, machines may be your best weapons.\\n\\nOf course, you may find yourself in a situation where it’s\\n\\nmachines or bust, as in the case of some hotel gyms and community fitness centers. In any event, you can get just as hard a workout with machinery as you can with iron. A note here: Whenever possible, we’d prefer you do your machine exercises on Hammer Strength equipment (lifefitness.com). This is a quality brand that offers a unique feature—isolateral movement. That means you can lift each limb independently. In this way, Hammer Strength equipment follows your unique biomechanics, letting your limbs work in their natural fashion, rather than having to conform to the narrower paths that most machines set.\\n\\nTHE BEST ALL-MACHINE WORKOUT WORKOUT #13 BY JASON FERRUGGIA\\n\\nThere are three likely reasons y ou w ould do a w orkout entirely w ith\\n\\nmachines. O ne is that y ou fear free w eights. A nother is that y ou’re in\\n\\na hotel gy m w ith machines as y our only w orkout options, and the third is that\\n\\ny ou’re a little beat up and need to protect ov erw orked joints or w ork around\\n\\nnagging injuries. Whatev er the case may be, machines are suitable muscle-\\n\\nbuilding equipment, and y ou can train y our w hole body w ith them.\\n\\nHOW IT WORKS\\n\\nThis w orkout uses a classic body building approach: py ramid sets. You start\\n\\nw ith higher reps and increase the w eight slightly each set w hile reducing reps\\n\\nto gradually w arm up the muscles and joints and recruit more and more\\n\\nmuscle fibers. N o matter how hard y ou train or how heav y y ou go, y ou’re\\n\\nunlikely to get injured, because the machines are stabilizing the load for y ou.\\n\\nThis isn’t alw ay s ideal, but it does allow y ou to push y ourself and focus y our\\n\\nmind solely on the muscles y ou w ant to w ork w ithout w orry ing about a freak\\n\\naccident keeping y ou out of the gy m for w eeks.\\n\\nDIRECTIONS\\n\\nP erform the exercise pairs (marked “A ” and “B”) as alternating sets. S o y ou’ll\\n\\ndo a set of A , rest, then a set of B, rest again, and continue for all the\\n\\nprescribed sets. The remaining exercises are done as conv entional straight\\n\\nsets.\\n\\n1A CHEST PRESS\\n\\nSETS: 3 REPS: 12, 10, 8 REST: 60 SEC.\\n\\nAdjust the height of the seat so that the handles are in line with the middle of your chest. When you grasp the handles, your elbows should be bent nearly 90 degrees. Press the handles until your elbows are locked out. Keep tension on your muscles at the bottom of each rep.\\n\\n1B CHEST-SUPPORTED ROW\\n\\nSETS: 3 REPS: 12, 10, 8 REST: 60 SEC.\\n\\nUsing a chest-supported row machine, row the weight to your belly, squeezing your shoulder blades together at the top of the movement.\\n\\n2A SHOULDER PRESS\\n\\nSETS: 3 REPS: 12, 10, 8 REST: 60 SEC.\\n\\nAdjust the seat of a shoulder press machine so that the handles are at shoulder level. If you have shoulder problems, and if your machine allows it, grasp the handles so your palms face each other. Otherwise, grasp them with palms facing forward as normal. Make sure your elbows track in a normal pressing path as you press the handles overhead.\\n\\n2B NEUTRAL-GRIP PULLDOWN\\n\\nSETS: 3 REPS: 15, 12, 10 REST: 60 SEC.\\n\\nAttach a close-grip V-handle to the pulley of a lat- pulldown machine, or use two single-grip handles as shown. Grasp the handle so your palms face each other and set your legs under the pad. Pull the handle to your collarbone, driving your elbows down and back.\\n\\n3 CALF RAISE ON LEG PRESS\\n\\nSETS: 3 REPS: 25, 20, 15 REST: 60 SEC.\\n\\nSet up in a leg press machine and place your feet at the bottom of the foot plate at shoulder width so that only the balls of your feet are on the plate. Remove the safeties and allow the weight to flex your ankles slowly until you feel a stretch in your calves. Extend your ankles to raise the weight back up.\\n\\n4 LEG PRESS\\n\\nSETS: 4 REPS: 25, 20, 15, 10 REST: 120 SEC.\\n\\nAdjust the seat of the machine so that you can sit comfortably with your hips beneath your knees and your knees in line with your feet. Remove the safeties and lower your knees toward your chest until they’re bent 90 degrees and then press back up. Be careful not to go too low or you risk your lower back coming off the seat (which can cause injury).\\n\\n07 BANDS\\n\\nThe elastic exercise band tends to get lumped in with the Body Bar, aerobics step, and Shake Weight as so-called “wussy” equipment, while the barbell and dumbbell are beyond reproach. But this isn’t a fair judgment, especially if you’re using high-quality bands.\\n\\nWe like the loop bands that Elitefts.net sells. They’re\\n\\ndurable and can be used for multiple purposes andnumerous exercises. If a cheap one is all you have, you can make do, but Elite’s bands are a good investment, especiallyif you plan on traveling a lot. Lightweight and compact, they allow you to take your workouts with you. What bands provide that no other equipment (except\\n\\ncables) can is accommodating resistance. Take the pushup, for example. The closer you get to locking out your elbows, the easier the exercise feels. The movement feels hardest when your chest is close to the floor. Adding resistance to the pushup with a band will intensify the last few inches of the move—as the band gets more stretched out—making you work harder, and there’s nothing wussy about that.\\n\\nTHE BEST FULL-BODY BAND WORKOUT WORKOUT #14 BY BEN BRUNO\\n\\nThis w orkout gets y our blood mov ing. In fact, it makes it run up and\\n\\ndow n y our body as y ou alternate betw een upper- and low er-body\\n\\nexercises, forcing y our heart to w ork extra hard, w hich in turn, stimulates\\n\\ncalorie burning. The result is increased strength and conditioning w hile\\n\\ntrimming fat.\\n\\nHOW IT WORKS\\n\\nThe exercises are grouped into “non-competing” mini-circuits. This means that\\n\\nthey w ork different areas of the body so muscle fatigue isn’t carried ov er from\\n\\none mov e to the next. F or instance, follow ing up a pushup w ith a good\\n\\nmorning w on’t make y our chest any more tired, so y ou can giv e each\\n\\nexercise y our full effort and strength. Your heart, how ev er, experiences the\\n\\nopposite effect. With blood racing back and forth to different muscles, y our\\n\\nheart rate is constantly elev ated. This leads to more calories burned during the\\n\\nw orkout and greater fat loss afterw ard.\\n\\nDIRECTIONS\\n\\nP erform the exercise groups in sequence. S o y ou’ll do one set of A , B, and C ,\\n\\nresting as prescribed betw een them, and then repeat until all the prescribed\\n\\nsets for that group are completed. N ote that the last group is just tw o\\n\\nexercises, though done in the same fashion. M ake sure y ou hav e a few\\n\\ndifferent band options so y ou can use the appropriate tension on each\\n\\nexercise.\\n\\n1A PUSHUP\\n\\nSETS: 4 REPS: 10–12 REST: 60 SEC.\\n\\nGrasp the end of a band in one hand and wrap it around your back. Get into pushup position with your hands shoulder width and your core braced. Pin both hands to the floor with the ends of the band in your palms and perform pushups.\\n\\n1B GOOD MORNING\\n\\nSETS: 4 REPS: 12 REST: 60 SEC.\\n\\nStand on the band and loop the other end over the back of your neck and stand tall. Keeping your lower back in its natural arch, bend your hips back and lower your torso until it’s nearly parallel to the floor. Think about keeping your chest up and pointing forward. Explosively extend your hips to come back up.\\n\\n1C PULL APART\\n\\nSETS: 4 REPS: 10 REST: 60 SEC.\\n\\nStand on and grasp a band loop, or a single tube as shown, hands shoulder width. Keeping your arms straight, raise your arms in front of your body to shoulder level. Now, without letting your arms drop, draw your arms out 90 degrees to your sides as if you were pulling the tube apart. Squeeze your shoulder blades together.\\n\\n2A SQUAT\\n\\nSETS: 4 REPS: 20 REST: 60 SEC.\\n\\nStand on the band or tube with feet shoulder width and toes turned slightly out. Grasp the ends of the band in each hand and hold them at shoulder level with palms facing you. Bend your hips back and squat down as low as you can without losing the arch in your lower back. Explosively extend your hips to come back up.\\n\\n2B BAND ROW\\n\\nSETS: 4 REPS: 15 REST: 60 SEC.\\n\\nAttach the band to a doorknob or other sturdy object of similar height. Hold the opposite end in both hands and stand back from the door so you feel tension on the band. Row the band to your belly.\\n\\n2C PALLOF PRESS\\n\\nSETS: 4 REPS: 10 (EA CH SIDE) REST: 60 SEC.\\n\\nAttach the band to a sturdy object at stomach level. Hold the other end with both hands and step away from the attachment point, turning your body perpendicular to it to put tension on the band. Pull the band in front of your chest and then press it out with arms straight. Bend your arms and draw your hands back toward you, resisting the band from twisting your torso. That’s one rep.\\n\\n3A TRICEPS PUSHDOWN\\n\\nSETS: 4 REPS: 20 REST: 60 SEC.\\n\\nAttach the band to a sturdy overhead object and grasp the free end with both hands. Tuck your elbows to your sides and extend your elbows to lock them out.\\n\\n3B BICEPS CURL\\n\\nSETS: 4 REPS: 15 REST: 60 SEC.\\n\\nAnchor the band under your feet, holding an end in each hand. Curl it without letting your upper arms drift forward.\\n\\n08 SUSPENSION TRAINER\\n\\nThe suspension trainer boom began about a decade ago, and what was once a piece of novel equipment is now hanging in gyms everywhere. The most popular brand, of course, is the TRX (trx.com), but competitors like the Jungle Gym XT (lifelineusa.com)—which we use to show the exercises that follow—are fine, too, so long as they offer foot cradles for performing lower-body exercises. With a suspension trainer’s incredible versatility, the number of exercises you can perform with it is about aslimitless as your imagination. It allows you to train the whole body using exercises that would be nearly impossible with free weights, machines, or any other equipment. And unlike those other tools, the suspension trainer can travel anywhere you do, and takes up about as much space in your suitcase as a pair of pants.\\n\\nWe suggest you don’t leave home without either one.\\n\\nTHE BEST SUSPENSION- TRAINER WORKOUT WORKOUT #15 BY JAY CARDIELLO\\n\\nA suspension trainer, such as the TRX or Jungle G y m XT, can mean\\n\\nthe difference betw een sticking w ith y our training w hile on the road\\n\\nand returning from y our trav els feeling slobbish. S o long as y our suspension\\n\\ntrainer is fully adjustable and offers foot cradles y ou’ll hav e a total-body gy m\\n\\nthat y ou can unpack from y our suitcase w henev er, w herev er.\\n\\nHOW IT WORKS\\n\\nThe kind of instability a suspension trainer prov ides is ideal for core\\n\\nstrengthening. To increase the instability , w e’v e designed this w orkout using\\n\\nunilateral exercises, meaning that y ou’ll be training each side of y our body\\n\\nindiv idually . If y ou need to reduce the intensity of an exercise, simply\\n\\nincrease the angle of y our body to the floor (shorten the length of the\\n\\nhandles/straps).\\n\\nThe workout at right lets you customize your training,\\n\\ngiving you a specific period of time in which to do your reps, rather than a concrete number of reps to hit every set.\\n\\nDIRECTIONS\\n\\nP erform the exercises as a circuit, completing one set of each in sequence. Do\\n\\nas many reps as y ou can in 30 seconds, resting only as long as it takes to set\\n\\nup the next exercise. P erform tw o to four circuits.\\n\\n1 SINGLE-LEG ROW\\n\\nREPS: A S MA NY A S POSSIBLE IN 30 SEC. (EA CH SIDE) REST: 0 SEC.\\n\\nAttach a suspension trainer to a doorframe or other sturdy object and stand on your left leg.

Row your body to the handles while driving your right knee up in front of you.\\n\\n2 SINGLE-LEG WOBBLE LUNGE\\n\\nREPS: A S MA NY A S POSSIBLE IN 30 SEC. (EA CH SIDE) REST: 0 SEC.\\n\\nSet the foot cradle of the suspension trainer to about a foot and a half above the floor and turn around. Raise your right foot and rest it inside the cradle. Bend your left knee so you descend into a lunge position.\\n\\n3 UNI-BRIDGE PRESS\\n\\nREPS: A S MA NY A S POSSIBLE IN 30 SEC. (EA CH SIDE) REST: 0 SEC.\\n\\nFace the suspension trainer’s attachment point and hold one handle in your left hand. Pick up a water bottle (or some other source of light resistance) in your right hand as if you were going to press. Lean back so your body is in a straight line at an angle, suspended by the handle. Row your body up until the handle touches your ribs while pressing the right hand over your chest.\\n\\n4 TAP OUT\\n\\nREPS: A S MA NY A S POSSIBLE IN 30 SEC. (EA CH SIDE) REST: 0 SEC.\\n\\nSet your feet in the cradles of the trainer and get into pushup position.

Continue for 30 seconds.\\n\\n5 PUSHUP ROCKET\\n\\nREPS: A S MA NY A S POSSIBLE IN 30 SEC. REST: 0 SEC.\\n\\nGet into pushup position with your feet in the cradles of the trainer and perform explosive pushups so that your hands leave the floor and you can clap in midair.\\n\\n09 MEDICINE BALL\\n\\nThe first medicine balls, used by athletes in ancient Persia, were bladders filled with sand. While medicine ball construction has come a long way since then, the science of how to use one hasn’t really had to evolve.\\n\\nMed balls can be thrown, caught, rested on, or lifted\\n\\nlike other weights, to apply a variety of stimuli to the muscles. Whether you want to experiment with one as a fun way to change up your workouts, or you find yourself someplace where the med ball (or a similar-sized volleyball or soccer ball) is the only implement you have to work with, we can show you how to use it like the sophisticated tool that it is.\\n\\nTHE BEST MEDICINE- BALL WORKOUT WORKOUT #16 BY ZACH EVEN-ESH\\n\\nThe medicine ball has been around forev er, but most guy s don’t know\\n\\nw hat to do w ith it, besides holding it against their chests during situps.\\n\\nE v en a light ball can deliv er an intense w orkout that burns fat and builds\\n\\nathletic pow er.\\n\\nHOW IT WORKS\\n\\nThe med ball can be used to replicate v arious O ly mpic w eightlifting exercises,\\n\\nand it makes performing them much simpler. These burn calories and build\\n\\nspeed, w hich is helpful if y ou’re interested in being competitiv e in backy ard\\n\\npickup games. In fact, the med ball is probably the most useful tool for\\n\\ndev eloping explosiv e strength because it’s meant to be throw n as hard as\\n\\npossible. When y ou toss it, y ou teach y our body to accelerate w ithout braking\\n\\nitself for safety .\\n\\nImagine a bench press done explosively—your shoulders\\n\\nmust slow it down at the end of the range of motion or they risk getting torn out of their sockets by the speed. The ball allows your body to “let go” safely because, well, you actually let go.\\n\\nA med ball can also be used to create an unstable\\n\\nsurface, such as by doing pushups on it. The dome shape\\n\\nforces you to stabilize your body more or risk taking a spill, and that means more activation of the abs.\\n\\nDIRECTIONS\\n\\nP erform the exercise pairs (marked “A ” and “B”) as supersets, so y ou’ll\\n\\ncomplete one set of A and then B before resting. Repeat until all sets are\\n\\ncomplete and then go on to the next superset.\\n\\n1A CLEAN AND PRESS\\n\\nSETS: 3 REPS: 10 REST: 0 SEC.\\n\\nHold the ball and stand with feet shoulder width. Bend your hips and knees and lower your body with arms extended until the ball is just above knee level. Explosively extend your hips and knees as if jumping, shrug your shoulders, and raise the ball to shoulder level. Squat down as you “catch” the momentum of the ball. Stand up and press it overhead. That’s one rep.\\n\\n1B SITUP AND THROW\\n\\nSETS: 3 REPS: 10 REST: 60 SEC.\\n\\nHold the ball with both hands in front of your chest and sit on the floor. Anchor your feet under something sturdy for support, and lie back on the floor a few feet away from a brick or concrete wall. Explosively sit up and throw the ball into the wall and then catch it on the rebound. If you have a partner, you can throw the ball to him instead and let him throw it back.\\n\\n2A MOUNTAIN CLIMBER\\n\\nSETS: 2 REPS: 20 (EA CH LEG) REST: 0 SEC.\\n\\nHold the ball with both hands and get into pushup position on the floor. Drive one knee up to your chest and then quickly drive it back while you raise the opposite knee.\\n\\n2B CLOSE-GRIP PUSHUP\\n\\nSETS: 2 REPS: 15 REST: 60 SEC.\\n\\nGet into pushup position on the floor, resting your hands on the ball. Keeping your body straight and your core braced, perform a pushup on the ball.\\n\\n3A BULGARIAN SPLIT SQUAT\\n\\nSETS: 2 REPS: 10 (EA CH SIDE) REST: 0 SEC.\\n\\nStand lunge length in front of a bench holding the ball with both hands at arm’s length overhead. Bend your left knee and rest the top of your left foot on the bench behind you. Lower your body until your front thigh is parallel to the floor.\\n\\n3B SEATED KNEE TUCK\\n\\nSETS: 2 REPS: 10 REST: 60 SEC.\\n\\nSit on a bench and squeeze the ball between your feet. Extend and elevate your legs out in front of you and extend your torso so that your body forms a straight line. Hold on to the bench for support. Crunch your torso forward and bring your knees to your chest.\\n\\n10 SWISS BALL\\n\\nSwiss balls were created as a tool for rehab, but their value in working the core and a host of stabilizer muscles is now universally known. If you’re a man of average height (about 5′9″), a ball with a 65-centimeter diameter will work best for you. Always make sure the ball is fully inflated and, for heaven’s sake, don’t try to stand on it. Wacky parlor tricks have given the Swiss ball a bad name, but used properly, it can improve your balance and strength rather than deprive you of them.\\n\\nTHE BEST SWISS-BALL WORKOUT WORKOUT #17 BY JIM SMITH, C.S.C.S.\\n\\nIt may be hard to imagine w orking y our entire body w ith just a S w iss\\n\\nball. A fter all, y ou can’t curl it, press it, or squat it. But the ball can let\\n\\ny ou get into positions to w ork y our muscles that y ou w ouldn’t normally think\\n\\nof, and the stability those positions require w orks more muscle than y ou\\n\\nrealize.\\n\\nHOW IT WORKS\\n\\nM any of the exercises flow into each other or consist of combinations of\\n\\nmov ements that flow together to equal one rep. C ontrolling these mov ements\\n\\non an unstable ball makes ev ery mov e a core exercise, ev en w hile y ou’re\\n\\ntargeting the chest, shoulders, legs, and back.\\n\\nDIRECTIONS\\n\\nP erform the exercises as a circuit, completing one set of each in turn w ithout\\n\\nrest. A fter the last exercise, rest tw o to three minutes and then repeat the\\n\\nentire circuit for three total sets.\\n\\n1 PUSHUP W/ FEET ON BALL\\n\\nSETS: 3 REPS: 20 REST: 0 SEC.\\n\\nGet into pushup position on the floor with hands shoulder width and rest your feet on the ball. Brace your abs and lower your body until your chest is just above the floor. Push back up. Do not let your hips dip or sway side to side at any point.\\n\\n2 T ON BALL\\n\\nSETS: 3 REPS: 20 REST: 0 SEC.\\n\\nLie chest-down on the ball and raise your arms out in front of you with palms facing up. Now move them out 90 degrees to form a T shape. Hold for one or two seconds with your shoulder blades squeezed together.\\n\\n3 BODY-WEIGHT SQUAT\\n\\nSETS: 3 REPS: 20 REST: 0 SEC.\\n\\nStand with feet shoulder width and toes turned out slightly. Sit back with your hips and lower your body as far as you can without rounding your lower back. Push your knees out as you descend and keep your chest up.\\n\\n4 LEG CURL\\n\\nSETS: 3 REPS: 20 REST: 0 SEC.\\n\\nLie on your back on the floor and rest your heels on a Swiss ball. Brace your abs and drive your heels into the ball to raise your hips off the floor. Bend your knees and roll the ball toward you. Keep your hips elevated the entire set.\\n\\n5 PIKE-UP TO SUPERMAN\\n\\nSETS: 3 REPS: 20 REST: 120–180 SEC.\\n\\nGet into pushup position with your toes on the ball. Bend your hips and roll the ball toward you so your torso becomes vertical. Roll back so your body is straight again and extend your spine, then roll the ball up your legs so your body forms a straight line with arms extended overhead but hands still on the floor. You should look like Superman flying downward. That’s one rep. Pull with your lats to return to the pushup position and begin the next rep.\\n\\n11 BODY WEIGHT\\n\\nThe most obvious advantage of body-weight workouts is that you can do them without equipment and in almost any location. But if that means absolutely no equipment— as in, not even a pullup bar—you’ll need to get pretty creative to be able to work your back.\\n\\nWe got that creative. When it’s warm, you may want to take your workouts\\n\\noutdoors and make use of equipment at your local playground, but you may not know how best to make a workout with it.\\n\\nWe know how to make a workout with it. If you thought body-weight training was just pushups\\n\\nand situps, these routines will open your eyes to the multitude of ways you can get ripped at those times when you feel as if you have no options at all.\\n\\nTHE BEST BODY-WEIGHT WORKOUT [option A] WORKOUT #18 BY ZACH EVEN-ESH\\n\\nIf y ou’v e ev er w ondered how guy s w ho w ork out exclusiv ely on\\n\\nmonkey bars in the park get so ripped, this w orkout is the answ er.

N ot only w ill y ou burn fat and build muscle w ith just\\n\\nthree exercises—y ou’ll learn one of the secrets street gy mnasts use to bang\\n\\nout dozens of reps of pullups and dips at a clip: the 10 to 1 method.\\n\\nHOW IT WORKS\\n\\nThe circuit w e’v e designed here doesn’t let up. When y ou train any squat\\n\\nv ariation, plus the pullup and the dip, y ou w ork nearly ev ery muscle in y our\\n\\nbody , and y our heart w ill race to supply them w ith blood and oxy gen.\\n\\nP erforming a decreasing number of reps—10 to 1—helps y ou keep the\\n\\nw orkout going despite being fatigued and builds the endurance that ultimately\\n\\nleads to being able to rattle off a high number of reps in one shot. In addition\\n\\nto getting y ou leaner, feel free to use this w orkout to w in bar bets about how\\n\\nmany pullups y ou can do.\\n\\nDIRECTIONS\\n\\nP erform the exercises as a circuit, completing a set of each in turn and resting\\n\\nas little as possible betw een sets. Repeat for 10 circuits (until y ou’re doing\\n\\nonly one rep per exercise).\\n\\n1 JUMP SQUAT\\n\\nREPS: 10 TO 1 REST: 0 SEC.\\n\\nStand with feet shoulder-width apart and squat down about halfway. Jump as high as you can. Land with soft knees and begin the next rep. Perform 10 reps. Each time you repeat the circuit, perform one less rep. So the next round you’ll do 9 reps, then 8, and so on down to 1 rep.\\n\\n2 PULLUP\\n\\nREPS: 10 TO 1 REST: 0 SEC.\\n\\nHang from a pullup bar, jungle gym, or tree limb and pull yourself up until your chin is higher than your hands. Perform 10 reps down to 1 as described at left.\\n\\n3 DIP\\n\\nREPS: 10 TO 1 REST: 0 SEC.\\n\\nSuspend yourself over parallel bars and then lower your body until your upper arms are parallel to the floor.

This w orkout is outside the box\\n\\n—so much so, in fact, that y ou’ll hav e to go outdoors to do it.\\n\\nHOW IT WORKS\\n\\nThis routine requires a park or play ground area w ith monkey bars and plenty\\n\\nof open space. You’ll use classic, though under-prescribed, body -w eight\\n\\nexercises like the bear craw l and crab w alk, w hich y ou probably hav en’t tried\\n\\nsince y our day s in summer camp. A s y ou’ll come to remember, they ’re not\\n\\neasy —especially for a grow n man w ell north of 100 pounds. They require a\\n\\nlot of w ork from y our heart, lungs, and core. Later, the parallel bar hand w alk\\n\\nw ill blow up y our grip and forearms; the sprints w ill fry y our legs.\\n\\nDIRECTIONS\\n\\nP erform the exercise pairs (marked “A ” and “B”) as supersets, so y ou’ll\\n\\ncomplete one set of A and then one set of B before resting. Repeat until all\\n\\nsets are complete. N ote that the parallel bar hand w alk is done as straight sets\\n\\n—do a set, rest, and repeat.\\n\\nThis workout combines well with Body-Weight option A,\\n\\nso if you want to integrate them both into a training week, perform A first, rest a day, and then perform B. (You can also add in option C, coming up next.)\\n\\n1A BEAR CRAWL\\n\\nSETS: 3 REPS: CRA WL FOR 50 FEET REST: 0 SEC.\\n\\nBend down and plant your hands on the ground.

By getting the lats involved, you incorporate strong stabilizing muscles that will let you go a little heavier on the triceps extensions—even if all the weight you have left to add is a couple of 2.5-pound plates.\\n\\nDIRECTIONS\\n\\nP erform all the sets for the first exercise before mov ing on to the second.\\n\\n1 POUNDSTONE CURL\\n\\nSETS: A S MA NY A S NEEDED REPS: 100 TOTA L REST: A S NEEDED\\n\\nGrasp the barbell at shoulder width.

But down the line, one muscle always seems to develop ahead of the other and you end up needing to give the weaker one greater attention.

MURPHY, M.F.S.\\n\\nIt w as once thought that the pump w as just a cosmetic side effect of\\n\\nlifting w eights, but it’s actually an integral part of the muscle-building\\n\\nprocess. P erforming reps creates tension in the muscles that, to some degree,\\n\\npinches off the v eins that take blood out of them w hile the arteries that\\n\\ndeliv er blood to the muscles continue unobstructed. S o the muscles fill up w ith\\n\\nblood faster than they can be cleared of it.

You should look like you’re praying. Squeeze the plates together, focusing on your chest, and press them out in front of you until your arms are extended. Flare your lats and pull the weights back to your chest. Complete your reps and then, on the second set, press the weights downward from your chest at a 45-degree angle. On the third set, press them upward at a 45-degree angle.\\n\\nTHE BEST SUSPENSION- TRAINER CHEST WORKOUT WORKOUT #43 BY BEN BRUNO\\n\\nWhen a guy w ants to get a big chest, he tends to make the classic\\n\\nmistake of training only his chest—or training it tw ice as often and as\\n\\nhard as any other body part. E v en if shirt-popping pecs is all y ou’re interested\\n\\nin, y ou’ll get faster results if y ou train the rest of the body , too, particularly\\n\\nthe upper back and shoulders. The routine at right addresses all three.\\n\\nH O W IT WO RKS The more muscle y ou add to one side of y our body , the\\n\\nmore y ou need to add to the opposite side in order to keep the balance. If\\n\\ny ou don’t, the body w ill ev entually forbid muscle grow th to the area that has\\n\\ngrow n out of w hack, because it doesn’t w ant to risk the injury . This is one of\\n\\nthe most common and easily prev entable w ay s to plateau.\\n\\nYou’ll target your chest very specifically in this routine\\n\\nwith moves like the three-way flye, which is borrowed from gymnastics training. The pec activation is like nothing you’ve tried before, so prepare to be sore. However, to keep your upper back and shoulders growing in conjunction with your pecs, we’ve thrown in some rows, reverse flyes, external rotations, and face pulls. Think of it\\n\\nas a way to build your chest without breaking it.\\n\\nDIRE C TIO N S P erform the exercise pairs (marked “A ” and “B”) as alternating\\n\\nsets.

Grasp the handles and get into pushup position with hands under your shoulders. Your entire body should be straight and your core braced. Bring your arms out to your sides as if you were giving someone a bear hug. Lower your body until you feel a stretch in your chest and then bring your arms together again. That’s one rep of the flye. Perform three reps. Now, from the starting position, open your arms but keep your elbows bent so that the move looks like a combination of a pushup and a flye. Press yourself back up. That’s one rep of the bent-arm flye. Perform three reps. From there, return to the starting position and perform pushups on the handles. Perform three reps. All of the above equals one set.\\n\\n1B INVERTED ROW\\n\\nSETS: 2 REPS: 12 REST: 90 SEC.\\n\\nHold the handles and lean back with arms extended so that your body is supported by the trainer and only your feet are on the floor. Brace your core and hold your body in a straight line. (The lower you set the handles, the harder the exercise; you can elevate your feet on something to make it even harder.) Row your body up until your chest is by your hands and your back is fully contracted. Rotate your wrists as you row your palms up in the end position.\\n\\n2A PUSHUP\\n\\nSETS: 3 REPS: 12–15 REST: 90 SEC.\\n\\nGrasp the handles and get into pushup position with hands under your shoulders. Your entire body should be straight and your core braced. Lower your body until your chest is between the handles.\\n\\n2B 3-WAY FINISHER\\n\\nSETS: 2 REPS: 5 REST: 120 SEC.\\n\\nGrasp the handles and lean back away from the trainer’s attachment point so that your weight is on your heels and your body is 45–50 degrees to the floor. Allow your arms to extend in front of you. Squeeze your shoulder blades together and draw your arms back until they’re 90 degrees out to your sides. (Keep a slight bend in your elbows.) That’s one rep of the reverse flye. Perform five reps. Now, from the start position of the reverse flye, draw your upper arms back with your elbows bent 90 degrees and knuckles facing the ceiling. Your upper body should make a W shape. That’s one rep of the external rotation. Perform five reps. From there, return to the starting position with arms extended and pull your hands to your forehead, twisting your palms to face in front of you as you pull. That’s one face pull. Perform five reps. All of the above equals one set.\\n\\nTHE BEST MEDICINE- BALL CHEST WORKOUT WORKOUT #44 BY NICK TUMMINELLO\\n\\nThis w orkout takes only 10 minutes and w orks the triceps hard in\\n\\naddition to the chest.

This is an exercise popular among strongman competitors, whose shoulders are the size of pumpkins. Finally, the workout ends with seated dumbbell cleans. If you’ve ever done power cleans, you know what exploding a weight up from the floor to shoulder level can do for your shoulders, and this variation isolates them\\n\\nmore. It’s as simple to do as it sounds: heave the weights up.

Allow the momentum to flip your wrists so you catch the weights at shoulder level.\\n\\n18 BACK\\n\\nGetting your mind into back training isn’t as easy as it is with the chest and arms. Because you can’t see your back, it is tougher to visualize how it is working, and so you must learn to focus on the feeling of your muscles contracting with each rep. Finding the right training implements for your needs can help with this. If dumbbells don’t work for you, bands might, because their accommodating resistance makes reps feel different than with free weights. It’s possible that simple pullups do the trick, because you’re able to imagine your hands as hooks designed to allow your lats to move your body up and down. Whatever may work best for you, we’ve got it covered here, so you can build your back with the same intensity you do your arms.\\n\\nTHE BEST FULL-GYM BACK WORKOUT WORKOUT #53 BY JIM SMITH, C.S.C.S.\\n\\nDeadlifts are one of our fav orite exercises at M en’s F itness.

(If you don’t know how much you can lift for one rep on the deadlift, estimate it conservatively.) Rest 90 seconds between these warmups. When you’re done, perform one set with 70–75% of your max for five reps and then rest 15 seconds. Perform three more sets of as many reps as possible, resting 15 seconds between sets.

Grasp the handles with palms facing you and hang. Now pull yourself up until your chin is over your hands. Begin to lower yourself, moving your elbows away from your body and rotating your palms to face forward. Do it slowly (it should take three to five seconds to come back down).

That’s one rep of the reverse flye. Perform five reps. Now, from the start position of the reverse flye, draw your upper arms back with your elbows bent 90 degrees and knuckles facing the ceiling. Your upper body should make a W shape. That’s one rep of the external rotation. Perform five reps.

The trick is to keep the circuit going, switching to exercises that are just easy enough to let you continue doing reps.

Eventually, every guy has to work his calves, even if it’s only during the few months leading up to summer. We don’t blame you for skipping them—even great trainers fail to program calf work into workouts because they don’t contribute to overall size, strength, and athleticism like the other muscles do. But that doesn’t mean they can’t bring your whole physique down if they’re stringy.\\n\\nThese routines bring the calves up fast. So if you have the patience to work them only in the late spring, that’s all you’ll need.\\n\\nTHE BEST FULL-GYM CALF WORKOUT WORKOUT #63 BY SEAN HYSON, C.S.C.S.\\n\\nDon’t ov erlook y our calv es—they ’re key to a complete phy sique.\\n\\nP lus, w hile today ’s shorts and bathing suits do a good job hiding y our\\n\\nthighs, y our calv es w ill alw ay s be on display during w armer months (that is,\\n\\nunless y ou refuse to w ear shorts because of y our calv es).\\n\\nThis routine is grounded in progressive overload, the\\n\\nfirst rule of weight training, which means gradually increasing the reps, sets, or weights you use and thereby forcing your muscles to continually adapt by growing bigger and stronger.

Give some of these\\n\\nworkouts a go and see if all your lifts don’t improve as a result.

Instead, we split up our body into parts that we train on different days; hence the term “split routine.” Yet there exists another way—to train the entire upper body one day and the lower half another—and there are several advantages to it.\\n\\nWorking the whole upper body one day allows you to\\n\\ncome back a few days later and work it again. Say you normally train your chest once every five days. You could hit it twice in three days, doubling the muscle-building stimulus simply by switching from body-part workouts to an upper-body split.\\n\\nUpper-body splits are also ideal for strength building,\\n\\nallowing you to focus workouts around a main lift and then working all the muscles that play a part in making that lift stronger.\\n\\nThe upper-body workouts we’ve included here pair up\\n\\nwell with the lower-body routines that follow them, something to consider if you’re looking for a complete program.\\n\\nTHE BEST UPPER-BODY WORKOUT [option A] WORKOUT #80 BY C.J.

It’s also v ery simple to do: Keep adding w eight to the bar\\n\\nuntil y ou reach the heav iest load y ou can handle for a giv en number of reps. After you max out your bench press, you’ll train the rest\\n\\nof the body heavy using exercises that help you to keep driving up your bench press and overall upper-body strength. As your strength increases, so will your muscle gains.\\n\\nAnd then we’ll revisit those forced reps.\\n\\nDIRE C TIO N S P erform the paired exercises (marked “A ” and “B”) as\\n\\nsupersets.

Pull the bar out of the rack and lower it to your sternum, tucking your elbows about 45 degrees to your sides. When the bar touches your body, drive your feet hard into the floor and press the bar back up. Perform several warmup sets, keeping your reps to five or fewer. Gradually work up to the heaviest weight that you can perform three reps with (this should take at least five sets). Refer back to chapter 2 for instructions on how to work up appropriately. Be sure to use a spotter or perform your sets in a power rack with spotter bars in place.\\n\\n2 NEUTRAL-GRIP FLOOR PRESS\\n\\nSETS: 4 REPS: 8, 8, 6, 5 REST: 180 SEC.\\n\\nGrasp a dumbbell in each hand and lie back on the floor. Rest your triceps on the floor with elbows close to your sides and palms facing each other. Press the weights over your chest and then lower your triceps back to the floor, but do not rest them. Pause for a moment under tension and begin the next rep.\\n\\n3 DUMBBELL ROW\\n\\nSETS: 2 REPS: 8, 20–25 (EA CH SIDE) REST: 120 SEC.\\n\\nRest your left knee and hand on a bench and grasp a dumbbell with your right hand.

If you choose to repeat the workout, perform six sets of four reps. In the next session, do eight sets of three. Do not perform this workout more than twice a week, and allow at least three days before repeating.\\n\\nWhen you use the 25-rep rule on the squat, spend the\\n\\nfirst three or four sets warming up so that only the last two are done with the heaviest weights possible.\\n\\nFor the remaining exercises, choose a weight that allows\\n\\nyou 10–12 reps in your first set and perform three sets with it, getting as many reps as possible. Rest 60 seconds between sets. Set a timer before you begin. Afterward,\\n\\ncount up all your reps and note the time. The next time you repeat the workout, try to beat that number of reps or your time. Do not add weight to an exercise until you can beat your last performance.\\n\\n1 SQUAT\\n\\nSETS: 5 REPS: 5 REST: 90–120 SEC.\\n\\nSet up in a squat rack or cage.

Step back and stand with your feet shoulder width and your toes turned slightly outward. Take a deep breath and bend your hips back and then bend your knees to lower your body until you’re on the box. Pause for a moment but don’t relax, and then extend your hips to come back up. Perform several warmup sets, keeping your reps to five or fewer. Gradually work up to the heaviest weight that you can perform three reps with (this should take at least five sets).

Your\\n\\nw ork interv al (WI) w ill be 85% of that number, and y our rest interv al (RI)\\n\\nw ill be 55% .\\n\\nFor example, a 30-year-old man will keep his heart rate at 160 beats per minute during the work interval and then reduce his effort to around 100 beats per minute for the rest interval. Note that the rest interval does not mean\\n\\ncomplete rest, but a very easy pace. If you don’t have a heart rate monitor, you can estimate your heart rate by putting your index and middle fingers to your carotid artery (to the left of your throat) and counting the beats in your pulse for six seconds.

Jason F erruggia, designer of this w orkout\\n\\nand a longtime training adv iser to M en’s F itness, is a huge fan of legendary\\n\\nN F L running back Walter P ay ton. H e likes to point out that P ay ton, w ho w as\\n\\nperpetually ripped and know n for his durability , made hill sprints a cornerstone\\n\\nof his w orkouts throughout his career.\\n\\nDo the same, and your pick-up game buddies may be\\n\\ncalling you “Sweetness,” or, at least, not “Slowness.”\\n\\nH O W IT WO RKS S printing is intense exercise and can beat up y our low er\\n\\nbody if y ou don’t ease into it.

Run at slightly less than your absolute top speed for safety. Rest as needed between sets, but keep your heart rate elevated. Allow yourself enough recovery that you can go fast. If you’re new to sprinting or haven’t done it in a while, do your sprints on a hill. Start with five and run only at a moderate pace and build up from there. Land on the balls of your feet as you sprint, not your heels. Your front foot should land directly beneath you (unless the hill is especially steep). Your arms should pump vigorously forward and backward as you run. Let your hands come up to face level and then back to your pockets, but no further. Keep your shoulders and hips level so there’s no side-to-side rotation in your torso.\\n\\n29 BOXING & MMA\\n\\nEvery guy wants to look like a fighter, before a fight, that is.

Izumi Tabata, P h.D.,\\n\\na researcher at the N ational Institute of F itness and S ports in Toky o, Japan,\\n\\nfound that brutally intense interv al w orkouts lasting just four minutes\\n\\nimprov ed endurance better than more conv entional interv al training—and\\n\\nincreased fat burning. We know y ou’v e got the time for this w orkout, and to\\n\\ngiv e y ou one less excuse to skip it, w e’ll giv e y ou only one exercise to do.\\n\\nH O W IT WO RKS Tabata w orkouts are designed according to a w ork-to-rest\\n\\nratio of 2:1. You go as hard as y ou can for, say , 20 seconds, rest 10, and then\\n\\nrepeat. You can choose one or sev eral exercises to use for Tabatas. We’v e\\n\\nprescribed just the burpee. A total-body exercise equally fav ored and dreaded\\n\\nby martial artists and soldiers, the burpee tires y ou out faster than probably\\n\\nany other body -w eight mov ement. It w ill make the ensuing four minutes the\\n\\nslow est of y our life.\\n\\nDIRE C TIO N S P erform burpees for 20 seconds. Don’t w orry about counting\\n\\nreps—just set a timer and do as many as y ou can. Then rest 10 seconds, and\\n\\nrepeat for four minutes. O v er time, y ou can add time to the w ork interv al,\\n\\nbut keep the ratio of w ork to rest at 2:1 (so if y ou build up to doing burpees\\n\\nfor 30 seconds, rest 15 seconds betw een sets).\\n\\nBURPEE\\n\\nStand with feet shoulder width and bend down and place your hands on the floor.

We’re busy ladies, so if we can get more bang for our buck with quick workouts, sign us up!\\n\\nHere, we share a four-minute thigh routine you can do daily. But don’t be fooled — just because it’s short doesn’t mean it should be easy. Quality is better than quantity, so focus on form, add a dumbbell if bodyweight is a bit too easy, and get to work.\\n\\n1. Side squats\\n\\nSquats are a girl’s best friend — they work your legs and your booty. Add in the side step and you’ll feel an extra burn in your thighs and hips.\\n\\nEquipment needed: a small dumbbell or weight if you need a challenge\\n\\nStand up straight with your legs shoulder-width apart and arms at your side (or holding a weight to your chest).\\n\\nStep to the right, and as you do so, sit back into a squat, raising your arms to a comfortable position in front of you if just using your bodyweight.\\n\\nRise and return to standing in center. Repeat on the left side.\\n\\nComplete 1 round for 1 minute.\\n\\n2. Plié leg lift\\n\\nIf you’ve ever done ballet, you know it’s killer on the thighs — that’s why we stole this dance-inspired move from a barre workout!\\n\\nEquipment needed: none\\n\\nStart in a plié squat position, hands on your sides. Toes should be pointed out, feet wider than shoulder-width apart and knees slightly bent.\\n\\nSquat down, pushing you hips back, and on your way up, lift the right leg up into the air at your side. Go as high as is comfortable. Safely return to the starting position.\\n\\nRepeat the same steps, raising the left leg.\\n\\nComplete 1 round for 1 minute.\\n\\n3. Single-leg bridge\\n\\nNo thigh-toning routine is complete without a bridge, which strengthens your hamstrings, glutes, and core. To get the most out of this exercise, squeeze your cheeks when you reach the top, really forming a mind-body connection.\\n\\nEquipment needed: a mat, plus a small dumbbell or weight if you need a challenge\\n\\nStart lying face up on a mat, knees bent with feet on the floor and palms facing down at your sides.\\n\\nLift your right leg up off the ground and straighten it out in front of you while your left leg stays bent.\\n\\nPressing your left heel into the floor, lift your pelvis up toward the ceiling, squeezing at the top when you reach a stiff bridge position.\\n\\nSlowly lower back down to the ground and repeat for 30 seconds. Switch legs, and complete 30 seconds with the left leg up to round out this exercise.\\n\\n4. Scissor planks\\n\\nBy this point you should be getting a little tired, but the scissor plank will challenge you until the end!\\n\\nEquipment needed: hardwood floor, towel or slider for each foot\\n\\nStart in a plank position with towels or sliders positioned under each toe.\\n\\nBracing your core and upper body, slowly drag your feet apart as wide as they’ll go. Pause, then pull them back to center using your thigh muscles. Keep your hips square to the ground and your core tight.\\n\\nComplete 2 rounds of 30 seconds each.\\n\\nTakeaway\\n\\nFind a way to work this routine into your daily schedule and commit to push harder each time.

This is a great exercise to use as a warmup.\\n\\nDirections:\\n\\nLie on your back with your knees bent, feet flat on the floor, and your arms extended by your sides.\\n\\nPushing through your feet and bracing your core, raise your bottom off the ground until your hips are fully extended, squeezing your glutes at the top.\\n\\nSlowly return to the starting position and repeat.\\n\\nChair squat\\n\\nShare on Pinterest\\n\\nSquat to strengthen your legs and core, which will make everyday movements easier. Starting with a chair underneath you will help you master proper form.\\n\\nDirections:\\n\\nStand in front of the chair with your feet shoulder-width apart, toes pointed slightly out.\\n\\nHinging at your hips and bending your knees, lower back and down until your bottom touches the chair, allowing your arms to extend out in front of you.\\n\\nPush up through your heels and return to the starting position.\\n\\nKnee pushup\\n\\nShare on Pinterest\\n\\nA beginner-style pushup, this move will help you build strength before attempting a standard pushup.\\n\\nDirections:\\n\\nGet into a high plank position from your knees.\\n\\nMaintaining a straight line from your head to your knees, bend your elbows to lower yourself down to the ground. Keep your elbows at a 45-degree angle.\\n\\nPush back up to start.\\n\\nStationary lunge\\n\\nShare on Pinterest\\n\\nHit your quads, hamstrings, and glutes with a stationary lunge.\\n\\nDirections:\\n\\nSplit your stance with your right leg in front. Your right foot should be flat on the ground, and your left foot should be up on its toes.\\n\\nBend your knees and lunge, stopping when your right thigh is parallel to the ground.\\n\\nPush up through your right foot to return to the starting position. Repeat for desired number of reps, then switch legs.\\n\\nPlank to Downward Dog\\n\\nShare on Pinterest\\n\\nThis move will test your upper body, especially your shoulders. Who says you need weights for a shoulder workout?\\n\\nDirections:\\n\\nGet into a high plank position, with your hands stacked underneath your shoulders and your feet close together.\\n\\nKeeping your core engaged and your hands and feet stationary, pike your hips up and back into the Downward Dog pose. Your body should form a triangle with the ground. Keep your neck neutral. Your gaze should be directed toward your feet.\\n\\nHold here for a second, then return to the plank. Repeat.\\n\\nStraight-leg donkey kick\\n\\nShare on Pinterest\\n\\nBuild those glutes with donkey kicks.\\n\\nDirections:\\n\\nGet on all fours, with your hands aligned with your shoulders and your knees aligned with your hips.\\n\\nKeeping your back straight, push your right foot out to the imaginary wall behind you while keeping your leg straight.\\n\\nYour foot should remain flexed (toes pointing down to the floor) throughout. Take care to keep your hips square to the ground. Squeeze your buttocks at the top.\\n\\nReturn to the starting position. Repeat for the desired number of reps. Repeat on the other leg.\\n\\nBird Dog\\n\\nShare on Pinterest\\n\\nA full-body move that requires balance and stability, the Bird Dog pose is easily scalable to your ability level. Start with this version if you’re a beginner.\\n\\nDirections:\\n\\nGet on all fours, ensuring your hands are directly underneath your shoulders and your knees are underneath your hips.\\n\\nKeeping your neck neutral, simultaneously extend your left arm and right leg, keeping your hips square to the ground. Pause here for 2 seconds.\\n\\nReturn to the start position. Repeat with your right arm and left leg.\\n\\nForearm plank\\n\\nShare on Pinterest\\n\\nA full-body exercise that requires strength and balance, planks put the core into overdrive.\\n\\nDirections:\\n\\nAssume a plank position on your forearms. Your body should form a straight line from head to feet.\\n\\nEnsure your lower back and hips don’t sag. Hold the position for 30 seconds to 1 minute.\\n\\nSide-lying hip abduction\\n\\nShare on Pinterest\\n\\nYou may not think about strengthening your hip muscles until they start to bother you, but please reconsider!\\n\\nThis is especially the case if you sit all day. Counteracting that with hip-targeting movements will be very beneficial.\\n\\nDirections:\\n\\nLie on your left side, with your left leg straight, right leg straight, and right foot resting on the ground.\\n\\nLift your right leg up, maintaining the position of your body. Make sure your hips don’t open up.\\n\\nReturn to the start position. Repeat for the desired number of reps, then do the other side.\\n\\nBicycle crunch\\n\\nShare on Pinterest\\n\\nAlthough you’ll work your core with almost all of these strength exercises, a targeted ab move doesn’t hurt.\\n\\nDirections:\\n\\nLie on your back and bring your legs to a tabletop position. Bend your elbows, and put your hands behind your head.\\n\\nCrunch up and bring your right elbow to your left knee, straightening your right leg.\\n\\nRelease the crunch slightly. Bend your right leg and straighten your left leg, then bring your left elbow to your right knee.\\n\\nRepeat for the desired number of reps.\\n\\nIntermediate routine\\n\\nIf you’ve mastered the beginner routine, you’re ready to take on these intermediate moves.\\n\\nComplete 2 sets of 10 to 15 reps of each exercise below, then move on to the next after 1 minute of rest.\\n\\nAn alternative, more advanced approach is to complete timed rounds. For instance, complete 1 minute of each exercise and repeat the circuit twice.\\n\\nCompete against yourself to get just 1 or 2 more reps each time you complete the routine.\\n\\nSingle-leg bridge\\n\\nAny time you take an exercise to a single leg, you’ll automatically make it harder.\\n\\nHere, follow the steps for a bridge, but lift one foot off the ground while keeping your leg bent for an intermediate challenge.\\n\\nComplete the same number of reps on each side.\\n\\nSquat\\n\\nTaking out the chair allows you to master the form of a regular bodyweight squat.\\n\\nThe same motion is still applicable here, though. Imagine you’re sitting down in a chair by hinging at the hips and pushing your bottom back.\\n\\nPushup\\n\\nA standard pushup is the more challenging version of a knee pushup. Assume a high plank position and complete the pushup in the same way, allowing your elbows to flare out at a 45-degree angle.\\n\\nWalking lunge\\n\\nBy traveling instead of staying stationary in a lunge, you’ll add aspects of stability, mobility, and balance.\\n\\nStart with your feet together and step forward, lunging with your right leg. Stand up, then repeat with your left leg.\\n\\nPike pushups\\n\\nAdding a pushup to your pike will target those shoulders even more. The movement here is all in the arms, so keep the rest of your body stable.\\n\\nTo perform, assume a pike position and bend at the elbows — allowing them to flare out to the sides — directing the top of your head toward the ground.\\n\\nGet-up squat\\n\\nGet-up squats are great for time under tension, or keeping your legs and glutes under continuous work, which adds to the burn.\\n\\nDirections:\\n\\nDrop down into a squat position. You won’t stand at all during this move.\\n\\nDrop your knees down to the ground one at a time so you’re kneeling.\\n\\nStep your feet back to the ground one at a time, maintaining that squat position.\\n\\nRepeat as quickly as you can while maintaining good form.\\n\\nSuperman\\n\\nWork your lower back — and the whole backside of your body — with a superman. Go as slowly as you can here to really reap the benefits of this move.\\n\\nDirections:\\n\\nLie on your stomach, arms and legs extended.\\n\\nKeeping your neck neutral, recruit your core and the back of your body to simultaneously raise your arms and legs up and off the ground as high as they’ll go.\\n\\nPause for 1 second at the top, and slowly lower back to the start position.\\n\\nPlank with alternating leg lift\\n\\nAdding a leg lift to a regular plank makes you unstable, requiring your core to work in overdrive and your three limbs to support more weight.\\n\\nLift one leg up, hold for 5 seconds, and return it to the ground. Repeat with the other leg.\\n\\nKneeling side plank with hip abduction\\n\\nHolding your body up with your knee and your extended arm during a hip abduction makes this move an upper body exercise, too. Plus, it recruits the core even more.\\n\\nTo perform, assume a kneeling side plank, then lift the free leg up, pause, and lower it back down. Repeat on both sides.\\n\\nDead bug\\n\\nActivate those deep core muscles with a dead bug.\\n\\nDirections:\\n\\nStart lying on your back, legs at tabletop, and arms extended in front of you.\\n\\nIn a coordinated motion, extend your left leg and drop your right arm above your head, taking care that your lower back stays flat to the ground.\\n\\nBring your leg back to tabletop and your arm in front of you, then repeat with the opposite arm and leg.\\n\\nAdvanced routine\\n\\nWhen the intermediate routine becomes a breeze, take a stab at these advanced moves.\\n\\nBridge with leg extended\\n\\nLifting the foot then extending the leg straight out will make a single-leg bridge even more difficult.\\n\\nKeep your foot flexed throughout the movement. Complete the same number of reps on both legs.\\n\\nOverhead squat\\n\\nExtending your arms overhead will challenge your mobility and range of motion in your upper body, as well as give your lower body the benefits of a squat.\\n\\nTo perform, complete a squat with your arms extended overhead throughout.\\n\\nOne-legged pushup\\n\\nLifting one leg will again put more weight into your other three limbs, thus creating more of a challenge.\\n\\nTo get it done, assume a pushup position and lift one leg off the ground, then complete the pushup.\\n\\nJumping lunges\\n\\nJumping exercises — often known as plyometrics — require you to give it your max effort for a short interval of time.\\n\\nBecause of the power and strength they require, you’ll feel the burn quickly.\\n\\nAdd a jump to your lunge, really exploding up in each rep, to challenge yourself.\\n\\nElevated pike pushups\\n\\nElevating your feet in a pike pushup will make this version the hardest.\\n\\nPut your feet on an elevated surface, like a bench or a step, and complete an elevated pike pushup.\\n\\nThe higher the surface, the more challenging it will be.\\n\\nGet-up squat with jump\\n\\nInstead of stepping your feet back up from kneeling, jump them. You’ll need lots of power and strength for this move.\\n\\nAdvanced Bird Dog\\n\\nGet into a high plank position, then complete a Bird Dog, lifting one arm and the opposite leg simultaneously.\\n\\nAs with all advanced exercises, maintaining a straight spine is key here.\\n\\nOne-leg or one-arm plank\\n\\nLifting one arm or one leg — and holding it there — will take a plank up a notch. Hold for as many seconds as you can, then switch sides.\\n\\nOne leg will be more challenging than one arm, so choose the right version for you.\\n\\nSide plank with hip abduction\\n\\nPlank off your foot instead of your knee for a full-body challenge in this hip abduction.\\n\\nTo perform, assume a side plank, then perform a leg lift. Repeat on both sides.\\n\\nHollow hold to jackknife\\n\\nThis move requires you to contract your abs throughout.\\n\\nDirections:\\n\\nGet into a hollow hold position: Lie on your back and extend your arms above your head. Engage your core, lift your legs and upper body off the floor, and hold them there.\\n\\nAdd in a jackknife: Crunch up, bringing your arms overhead toward your toes and your legs toward the center of your body.\\n\\nSlowly release back to the jackknife position and repeat.\\n\\nThe bottom line\\n\\nBodyweight exercises will make your at-home workout challenging no matter your fitness level. Start with our beginner routine, and in just a matter of months, you could be well on your way to mastering the advanced routine.

But if you know what you’re looking for, you can purchase adjustable dumbbells online.\\n\\nRest intervals: 60–90 seconds\\n\\nDay 1: Legs, shoulders, and abs\\n\\nLegs: dumbbell squats — 3 sets of 6–8 reps\\n\\nShoulders: standing shoulder press — 3 sets of 6–8 reps\\n\\nLegs: dumbbell lunge — 2 sets of 8–10 reps per leg\\n\\nShoulders: dumbbell upright rows — 2 sets of 8–10 reps\\n\\nHamstrings: Romanian dumbbell deadlift — 2 sets of 6–8 reps\\n\\nShoulders: lateral raises — 3 sets of 8–10 reps\\n\\nCalves: seated calf raises — 4 sets of 10–12 reps\\n\\nAbs: crunches with legs elevated — 3 sets of 10–12 reps\\n\\nDay 2: Chest and back\\n\\nChest: dumbbell bench press or floor press — 3 sets of 6–8 reps\\n\\nBack: dumbbell bent-over rows — 3 sets of 6–8 reps\\n\\nChest: dumbbell fly — 3 sets of 8–10 reps\\n\\nBack: one-arm dumbbell rows — 3 sets of 6–8 reps\\n\\nChest: pushups — 3 sets of 10–12 reps\\n\\nBack/chest: dumbbell pullovers — 3 sets of 10–12 reps\\n\\nDay 3: Arms and abs\\n\\nBiceps: alternating biceps curls — 3 sets of 8–10 reps per arm\\n\\nTriceps: overhead triceps extensions — 3 sets of 8–10 reps\\n\\nBiceps: seated dumbbell curls — 2 sets of 10–12 reps per arm\\n\\nTriceps: bench dips — 2 sets of 10–12 reps\\n\\nBiceps: concentration curls — 3 sets of 10–12 reps\\n\\nTriceps: dumbbell kickbacks — 3 sets of 8–10 reps per arm\\n\\nAbs: planks — 3 sets of 30-second holds\\n\\nThis home workout routine includes all the exercises you need to make sizable muscle and strength gains with minimal equipment.\\n\\nBeginner’s workout routine for men\\n\\nStarting out in the gym can seem intimidating, but with proper guidance, the process becomes more approachable — and even invigorating.\\n\\nAs a beginner, you can progress very quickly because almost any exercise promotes muscle and strength gains. Still, it’s important to avoid overexertion, which can lead to injuries or decreased performance.\\n\\nThis workout routine has you in the gym 3 days per week (such as Monday, Wednesday, and Friday), with full-body sessions completed each day. This allows you to get used to new movements, focus on proper form, and take time to recover.\\n\\nYou can add reps and sets as needed as you progress.\\n\\nThe beginner phase should last as long as you continue to improve. Some people may plateau at around 6 months, whereas others may continue to see results for more than a year.\\n\\nEquipment required: fully equipped gym\\n\\nRest periods: 90–180 seconds for main movements, 60–90 seconds for accessories\\n\\nIntensity: Select a weight that allows you to complete the prescribed reps while leaving about 2 solid reps in the tank.\\n\\nDay 1: Full body\\n\\nLegs: barbell back squats — 3 sets of 5 reps\\n\\nChest: flat barbell bench press — 3 set of 5 reps\\n\\nBack: seated cable rows — 3 sets of 6–8 reps\\n\\nShoulders: seated dumbbell shoulder press — 3 sets of 6–8 reps\\n\\nTriceps: cable rope triceps pushdowns — 3 sets of 8–10 reps\\n\\nShoulders: lateral raises — 3 sets of 10–12 reps\\n\\nCalves: seated calf raises — 3 sets of 10–12 reps\\n\\nAbs: planks — 3 sets of 30-second holds\\n\\nDay 2: Full body\\n\\nBack/hamstrings: barbell or trap bar deadlifts — 3 sets of 5 reps\\n\\nBack: pullups or lat pulldowns — 3 sets of 6–8 reps\\n\\nChest: barbell or dumbbell incline press — 3 sets of 6–8 reps\\n\\nShoulders: machine shoulder press — 3 sets of 6–8 reps\\n\\nBiceps: barbell or dumbbell biceps curls — 3 sets of 8–10 reps\\n\\nShoulders: reverse machine fly — 3 sets of 10–12 reps\\n\\nCalves: standing calf raises — 3 sets of 10–12 reps\\n\\nDay 3: Full body\\n\\nLegs: leg press — 3 sets of 5 reps\\n\\nBack: T-bar rows — 3 sets of 6–8 reps\\n\\nChest: machine or dumbbell chest fly — 3 sets of 6–8 reps\\n\\nShoulders: one-arm dumbbell shoulder press — 3 sets of 6–8 reps\\n\\nTriceps: dumbbell or machine triceps extensions — 3 sets of 8–10 reps\\n\\nShoulders: cable or dumbbell front raises — 3 sets of 10–12 reps\\n\\nCalves: seated calf raises — 3 sets of 10–12 reps\\n\\nAbs: decline crunches — 3 sets of 10–12 reps\\n\\nThis 3-day beginner program provides the full-body stimulus you need to gain muscle while allowing adequate recovery between sessions.\\n\\nIntermediate workout routine for men\\n\\nAfter working hard in the gym for several months, it’s time to step your training up a notch to keep your gains coming.\\n\\nAt this point, you should have good exercise technique and be able to handle more weight on the bar.\\n\\nThis 4-day-per-week intermediate program increases reps and sets to stimulate new muscle growth. When they become too easy, you can gradually add more weight or more reps/sets.\\n\\nIf you do it correctly, you can follow this routine for several years until you reach an advanced level. It may be helpful to switch up your exercises on occasion to keep yourself engaged and prevent burnout.\\n\\nRemember that soreness is not always an indicator of muscle growth. Now that you have some training experience, you may not get sore after every workout.\\n\\nEquipment required: fully equipped gym\\n\\nRest intervals: 90–180 seconds for main movements, 60–90 seconds for accessories\\n\\nIntensity: Select a weight that allows you to complete the prescribed reps while leaving about 2 solid reps in the tank.

Keep in mind that you should not attempt this routine unless you’ve been training consistently for 2 or more years.\\n\\nWhile the muscle gains won’t come as fast as they did when you were a beginner, there’s still room for significant progress at this stage.\\n\\nThis grueling workout routine has you in the gym 6 days per week with 1 rest day in between. It follows a pull-push-legs pattern, hitting each muscle group twice per week, with supersets incorporated for maximum hypertrophy (muscle growth).\\n\\nAgain, you can increase weight on the bar, as well as sets and reps, from week to week to ensure continued progress while following this program.\\n\\nEquipment required: fully equipped gym\\n\\nRest periods: 90–180 seconds for main movements, 60–90 seconds for accessories\\n\\nIntensity: Select a weight that allows you to complete the prescribed reps while leaving about 2 solid reps in the tank. To increase intensity, go to failure on the last set.\\n\\nSupersets: Complete the initial set of the first movement immediately followed by the second movement. Repeat until all designated reps and sets are complete.\\n\\nPull A\\n\\nBack/hamstrings: barbell deadlift — 5 sets of 5 reps\\n\\nBack: pullups or lat pulldowns — 3 sets of 10–12 reps\\n\\nBack: T-bar rows or seated cable rows — 3 sets of 10–12 reps\\n\\nRear deltoids/traps: face pulls — 4 sets of 12–15 reps\\n\\nBiceps: hammer curls — 4 sets of 10-12 reps supersetted with dumbbell shrugs 4 sets of 10–12 reps\\n\\nBiceps: standing cable curls — 4 sets of 10–12 reps\\n\\nPush A\\n\\nChest: flat barbell bench press — 5 set of 5 reps\\n\\nShoulders: seated dumbbell press — 3 sets of 6–8 reps\\n\\nChest: incline dumbbell bench press — 3 sets of 10–12 reps\\n\\nTriceps/shoulders: triceps pushdowns — 4 sets of 10–12 reps supersetted with lateral raises — 4 sets of 10–12 reps\\n\\nChest: cable crossovers — 4 sets of 10–12 reps\\n\\nLegs A\\n\\nLegs: barbell back squats — 5 sets of 5 reps\\n\\nHamstrings: Romanian dumbbell deadlifts — 3 sets of 6–8 reps\\n\\nLegs: leg press — 3 sets of 8–10 reps\\n\\nHamstrings: lying leg curls — 4 sets of 10–12 reps\\n\\nCalves: seated calf raises — 4 sets of 12–15 reps\\n\\nAbs: decline crunches — 4 sets of 12–15 reps\\n\\nPull B\\n\\nBack: bent-over barbell rows — 3 sets of 6–8 reps\\n\\nBack: pull-ups (weighted if needed) — 3 sets of 8–10 reps\\n\\nBack: one-arm rows — 3 sets of 8–10 reps\\n\\nLower back: hyperextensions — 4 sets of 10–12 reps supersetted with machine preacher curls — 4 sets of 10–12 reps\\n\\nTraps: barbell shrugs — 4 sets of 10–12 reps\\n\\nBiceps: standing dumbbell curls — 4 sets of 10–12 reps\\n\\nPush B\\n\\nShoulders: overhead press — 5 sets of 5 reps\\n\\nChest: dumbbell bench press (incline or flat) — 3 sets of 8–10 reps\\n\\nChest/triceps: dips (weighted if needed) — 4 sets of 10–12 reps\\n\\nShoulders: single-arm cable lateral raises — 4 sets of 10–12 reps\\n\\nChest: machine fly — 4 sets of 10–12 reps\\n\\nTriceps: overhead extensions with rope — 4 sets of 10–12 reps\\n\\nLegs B\\n\\nLegs: barbell front squats — 5 sets of 5 reps\\n\\nHamstrings: glute ham raises — 3 sets of 8–10 reps\\n\\nLegs: walking dumbbell lunges — 3 sets of 10–12 reps per leg\\n\\nQuadriceps: seated leg extensions — 4 sets of 10–12 reps supersetted with standing calf raises — 4 sets of 12–15 reps\\n\\nAbs: hanging leg raises — 4 sets of 12–15 reps\\n\\nThis advanced program is incredibly intense and follows a push-pull-legs pattern for 6 days per week. Attempt this program only if you have several years of training under your belt.\\n\\nConsiderations for lifters over 40\\n\\nAs you age, muscle and bone mass gradually decrease. Nonetheless, you can counteract this loss by following a resistance training program to stimulate muscle and bone growth (1Trusted Source, 2Trusted Source).\\n\\nThe exercise routines outlined above still apply to people ages 40 and older, though you may to replace some exercises with more joint-friendly options — especially if you have any preexisting injuries.\\n\\nFor example, you can do goblet squats instead of back squats or triceps pushdowns instead of dips.\\n\\nRegardless of your age, it’s best to start with the beginner program and work your way up.\\n\\nIt’s also important not to work out too strenuously, because there’s an increased risk of injury as you age. You may likewise need to extend recovery times to 2 days between workouts instead of 1 day, because your body takes more time to recuperate (3Trusted Source).\\n\\nWhile exercise presents some obstacles for those over 40, maintaining a proper resistance training program can provide endless benefits and keep you consistently in shape.\\n\\nTrainees over age 40 may have to adjust their workout routine to account for injuries or slower recovery times. While muscle and bone mass decline as you age, you can combat this with proper exercise.\\n\\nDon’t forget nutrition\\n\\nWhile working out in the gym provides the stimulus for muscle and strength gains, nutrition plays a major role in recovery and exercise optimization.\\n\\nThus, it’s important to ensure that your food intake is adequate to meet the demands of your training.\\n\\nYou can do this by ensuring sufficient calorie, protein, carb, and fat intake based on your training intensity and physique goals. You can use a calorie counter to calculate your needs.\\n\\nIn order to gain muscle, it’s best to be in a calorie surplus, or eat more than your body needs to sustain itself. A surplus of 10–20% over your baseline calorie needs should be sufficient to promote muscle gains (4Trusted Source).\\n\\nIf you’re trying to lose body fat instead, maintaining your baseline or adopting a slight calorie deficit is generally recommended (4Trusted Source).\\n\\nNutrient timing, which involves eating at specific times to yield results, may also be vital to maximize muscle gains. For example, many experts recommend eating a well-balanced meal or snack within 2 hours of a workout, ideally both before and after (5Trusted Source, 6Trusted Source).\\n\\nIf you want to ensure proper dietary intake or create an individualized plan to help you meet your goals, consider consulting a registered dietitian.\\n\\nProper nutrition is vital to exercise because it provides your body with the necessary building blocks for gaining muscle and strength.\\n\\nRelated Videos\\n\\nWatch More\\n\\nTips\\n\\nWhen starting a new strength training program, it’s important to take precautions to avoid getting injured or overexerting yourself.\\n\\nFirst, you’ll want to accurately assess your level of experience as outlined above and select the appropriate workout program for you.\\n\\nIt’s always best to start with a program that may be slightly too easy rather than an advanced program that is too difficult.\\n\\nThe workout routines above are broken down into specific muscle groups for each session to provide enough stimulus to achieve results without overtaxing your body.\\n\\nWhat is your goal?\\n\\nDepending on your individual goal, you may want to consider adjusting your reps and sets.\\n\\nFor instance, if strength is your goal (your power against resistance), the National Sports and Conditioning Association recommends 3 or more sets of up to 6 reps. You should lift heavier loads if strength is your goal (7, 8).\\n\\nIf hypertrophy, or an increase in muscle size and definition, is your goal, focus on sets of 6–12 reps with 1 minute of rest in between. You should lift about 65–85% of your 1-rep maximum for hypertrophy (9).\\n\\nIf muscular endurance is your goal, you’ll want to focus on lighter weight and higher reps (8).\\n\\nWas this helpful?\\n\\nIn addition, performing a proper warmup is key to avoiding injury because it primes your muscles and cardiovascular system for the exercises to come.\\n\\nWear comfortable, close-fitting clothing that makes it easy to move, along with sneakers or other appropriate footwear.\\n\\nIf you’re increasing the weight you’re lifting or are unsure about a movement, it’s a good idea to have a spotter keep a close eye on the weight while you move it.\\n\\nLastly, allowing sufficient recovery time between workouts is another factor that will greatly reduce your risk of injury.\\n\\nTo avoid getting injured or overexerting yourself, it’s important to choose an appropriate workout routine for your level of experience, perform a proper warmup before exercising, and allow enough recovery time between workout sessions.\\n\\nThe bottom line\\n\\nWhether you’re a new or seasoned gym-goer, workout routines catered to your experience level can help you progress toward your muscle and strength goals.\\n\\nOver time, you may find that your body responds better to certain movements than to others and choose to adapt your training accordingly.\\n\\nA proper exercise regimen and good nutrition habits are the first steps to getting in the best shape of your life, no matter your level of experience.\\n\\nIf you have an underlying health condition, it’s always best to check with a healthcare professional before starting any exercise program.\\n\\nLast medically reviewed on  February 16, 2022\\n\\nHow we reviewed this article:\\n\\nHistory\\n\\nOur experts continually monitor the health and wellness space, and we update our articles when new information becomes available.\\n\\nCurrent Version\\n\\nFeb 24, 2023\\n\\nWritten By\\n\\nDaniel Preiato\\n\\nEdited By\\n\\nSaralyn Ward\\n\\nFeb 16, 2022\\n\\nWritten By\\n\\nDaniel Preiato\\n\\nEdited By\\n\\nSaralyn Ward\\n\\nMedically Reviewed By\\n\\nMicky Lal, MA, CSCS,RYT\\n\\nCopy Edited By\\n\\nJill Campbell\\n\\nVIEW ALL HISTORY\\n\\nShare this article\\n\\nMedically reviewed by Micky Lal, MA, CSCS,RYT —\\n\\nBy Daniel Preiato, RD, CSCS —\\n\\nUpdated on February 24, 2023\\n\\nRead this next\\n\\nBodyweight Exercise Routines for Beginners and More AdvancedIf you’re trying to target arms, chest, back, core, and legs, here are 12 bodyweight exercises you can do.

You do. It\\'s the intensity of your workout that\\'s key. A short–burst, high–intensity workout boosts your metabolism and tones muscles. Get moving with this 30–minute \"quickie\" routine that includes cardio and resistance training.\\n\\nIf you\\'re new to exercise, a man over age 45 or a woman over age 55, or have a health problem, check with your doctor before starting a fitness program.\\n\\nBeginner Squats: For Thighs\\n\\n2/16\\n\\nIf you\\'re new at this, get started with a beginner version of squats using an exercise ball. Stand against a wall with the ball at your lower back, feet hip–width apart and out in front. Keeping your body upright, slowly lower your body by bending at the hips and knees, dropping glutes toward the floor; slowly move back to the starting position. Do 10 times.\\n\\nSquats: For Thighs\\n\\n3/16\\n\\nOnce you\\'re ready, try squats without an exercise ball. For good form: Keep your feet shoulder-width apart and your back straight. Bend your knees and lower your rear as if you were sitting down, keeping your knees over your ankles. In the \"wrong\" picture, notice how the knees are too far forward. To target more muscle groups in less time, add an overhead press at the same time. With a dumbbell in each hand, rise from the squat position and push weights overhead, palms out. Do 10 times.\\n\\nForward Lunge: For Thighs\\n\\n4/16\\n\\nStanding with feet hip–width apart, take a big step forward with one leg, then lower your body toward the floor, front knee aligned with ankle, back knee pointing to the floor. Return to the starting position, and repeat by stepping forward with the other leg. For more challenge, hold a free weight in both hands and complete the lunge with a rotation in the torso, twisting the body toward the forward leg. Do 10 times on each side.\\n\\nDeadlift: For Hamstrings\\n\\n5/16\\n\\nTo do a deadlift holding a bar or free weights, stand up straight with feet hip–width apart. Bend at your hips, moving the hips backward as you lower your upper body parallel to the floor. Keep your legs straight without locking the knees, and keep the back level and the spine in neutral. Lower the weight to just below your knees, then slowly return to the starting position. Do 10 times.\\n\\nRELATED:\\n\\n\\n\\nBridge: For Glutes\\n\\n6/16\\n\\nThe bridge works the glutes (butt), hamstrings, and core. Lying on your back with knees bent and feet hip-width apart, peel your spine off the floor, starting at the tailbone, forming a diagonal line from knees down to shoulders. Slowly return to the starting position. For an extra challenge: Target your triceps by holding light weights, lifting your arms toward the ceiling as you raise your hips. Bend your elbows to lower the weights towards the floor. Do 10 times.\\n\\nPush-Ups: For Chest and Core\\n\\n7/16\\n\\nLet\\'s move to the upper body. Push-ups strengthen the chest, shoulders, triceps, and core muscles. Starting on all fours, place hands a bit wider than your shoulders. Place toes on the floor, creating a smooth line from shoulders to feet. Keeping core muscles engaged, lower and lift your body by bending and straightening your elbows. Too hard? Place knees on the floor instead of toes. To boost the workout, add an exercise ball under the hips, knees, or feet. Do 10 times.\\n\\nChest Press: For the Chest\\n\\n8/16\\n\\nFor a less demanding exercise than push-ups to help build and tone your chest muscles,\\xa0you can try the chest press with weights. Lie face-up on a bench, with knees bent and\\xa0feet on the floor, spine relaxed. Press a bar or dumbbells from your chest toward the ceiling. Extend your arms but don’t lock the elbows, and move slowly in both directions, keeping shoulder blades on the bench. For an extra challenge, do the chest press with your head and upper back on an exercise ball. Do 10 times.\\n\\nBent-Over Row: For Back and Biceps\\n\\n9/16\\n\\nThe bent-over row works all the major muscles of the upper back as well as the biceps. Begin the exercise in a bent-over position with your back flat, one knee and one hand on the same side of the body braced on a bench. Hold a free weight in the other hand with arm extended. Lift the weight toward the hip until the upper arm is just beyond horizontal, see right. Then slowly lower weight to the starting position. Do 10 times.\\n\\nShoulder Press: For Shoulders\\n\\n10/16\\n\\nA shoulder press works the shoulder muscles and can be performed standing or seated. For extra back support, use a bench with a back rest. Begin with elbows bent and weights at shoulders. Slowly reach toward the ceiling, keeping the elbows under the hands and the shoulders away from the ears; slowly lower back to the starting position. Do 10 times.\\n\\nRELATED:\\n\\n\\n\\nCable Pull Down: For Upper Back\\n\\n11/16\\n\\nFor the last upper body exercise, do the cable pull down, which works the upper back. Using a cable machine, sitting straight with a neutral spine, grasp the bar with arms extended. Slowly pull the bar down past the face and toward the chest. Only go as far as you can without leaning back, and control the weight on the way back up. Do 10 times.\\n\\nBicycle Crunch: For Core & Abdominals\\n\\n12/16\\n\\nLying on your back on the floor, fold knees toward the chest and curl the upper body off the floor. With hands behind head, slowly rotate upper body to the right while drawing the right knee in and reaching the left leg out. Then rotate left and pull the left knee in and extend right leg out. Focus on bringing the shoulder toward the hip (rather than the elbow to the knee), and keep the opposite shoulder off the floor. Do 10 times.\\n\\nSide Plank: For Core or Abdominals\\n\\n13/16\\n\\nFor another abdominal alternative, lie on your side with a bent elbow directly under your shoulder, and use your torso muscles to lift the body up into a side plank. Then lift the hips higher, then back to the plank, then lower. Do as many as you can with proper form, then repeat on the other side. If this exercise hurts your shoulder or neck, lift only your legs, keeping the hips stacked. Your head will rest on your bent arm.\\n\\nGo For 20 Minutes\\n\\n14/16\\n\\nBefore moving on to the cardio portion of the workout, be sure you\\'ve completed 20 minutes of resistance training. If you have, now\\'s a good time for a water break to keep your body well-hydrated. If you haven\\'t, go back and start the circuit over again until you reach the 20 minute goal.\\n\\nCardiovascular Training\\n\\n15/16\\n\\nVary the intensity during your cardio workout. Use intervals, taking about a minute to get from moderate speed to intense. Whether you\\'re on the stair-stepper, the elliptical trainer, or the treadmill, do:\\n\\n30 seconds of the highest speed you can tolerate, then 30 seconds of normal speed.\\n\\nThen 30 seconds of the stiffest resistance you can handle, then 30 seconds of normal.\\n\\nKeep moving back and forth between speed and resistance until you\\'ve completed 10 minutes.\\n\\nRELATED:\\n\\n\\n\\nHow Often?\\n\\n16/16\\n\\nDo this 30-minute workout routine every other day, or do it two days in a row if that\\'s better for your schedule. These are not hard-core exercises where you need more rest to recover.\\n\\nShow Sources\\n\\nIMAGES PROVIDED BY:\\n\\n(1) George Doyle / Stockbyte / Getty Images\\n\\n(2-13) Brayden Knell / WebMD\\n\\n(14)\\xa0 Stockbyte / Getty Images\\n\\n(15) Brayden Knell / WebMD\\n\\n(16) amana productions inc. / Getty Images\\n\\nREFERENCES:\\n\\nJonathan Ross, personal trainer; owner, Aion Fitness, Bowie, Md.\\n\\nPetra Kolber, spokeswoman, the IDEA Health and Fitness Association; contributing editor, Health magazine.\\n\\nAmerican College of Sports Medicine: \"Physical Acitvity and Public Health Guidelines.\"\\n\\nKathleen M.

The best workout schedule for you will depend on various factors like your age, fitness level, goals, and any physical restrictions you may have.\\n\\nHaving a properly planned workout schedule will provide structure to your workouts and ensure you incorporate strategies that help you see the results you want. Workout plans also help you know exactly what to do so you aren\\'t left guessing.\\n\\nDepending on your goals, a workout schedule will likely include resistance training, cardiovascular exercise, active rest, and flexibility or mobility work. Some of these workouts can be combined or done on separate days. Active rest is essential on the days you are not completing more intense training.\\n\\nTypes of Exercise You Need\\n\\nWhether your goal is to lose weight, improve your health, get in better shape, or all of the above, there are three main components to a good exercise program:\\n\\nCardio exercise:\\xa0Cardio can be any activity that gets your heart rate up, from walking or jogging to cycling or taking a fitness class. Regardless of the exercise, it is always smart to warm up with 5 to 10 minutes of light cardio.\\n\\nWeight training: You don\\'t have to lift heavy weights or even spend a lot of time on weight training at first, but you do need to lift. Your muscles will get stronger, helping with daily functioning, and more muscle mass will boost your metabolism.1\\n\\nFlexibility training:\\xa0You also need to have the flexibility to go through a full range of motion for each exercise you do. Stretching increases your flexibility and helps your body recover after exercise.2 While some people like to set aside a day to focus on flexibility, you don\\'t need a separate workout for this—stretching should be included in every workout.\\n\\nSome people prefer to set a schedule with days devoted to just cardio or strength training. However, these exercises can be done on the same day or even combined with high-intensity interval training (HIIT) so long as you are physically fit enough and leave time for recovery.\\n\\nSet a weekly schedule in advance to ensure you get the right amount of each of these types of exercise throughout the week.\\n\\nWhy You Need Both Cardio and Strength Training\\n\\nWhere to Start\\n\\nNo one workout program is going to fit everyone, but it may help to see a sample workout schedule that includes all the workouts you need, whether you\\'re a beginning\\xa0exerciser or more advanced or experienced.\\n\\nThese sample workouts give you a place to start, but they\\'re only suggestions. First, determine your fitness level\\xa0so you know whether to use beginner, intermediate or advanced schedules.\\n\\nA Guide to Exercise for Beginners\\n\\nBeginner Workout Schedule\\n\\nIf you\\'re new to exercise, remember these basics and give yourself time to get used to regular workouts.\\n\\nEase into exercise. Start with a simple cardio program and a full-body strength training routine. If that\\'s too much, start with strength training and let that be enough. Most strength training workouts will also increase your heart rate, working your cardiovascular system.\\n\\nBe sure to rest and recover. You may need extra recovery days to allow your body to rest and heal. It\\'s normal to be sore when you try new activities, but if you can\\'t move the next day, that means you overdid it and may need to back off your next workout.3\\n\\nMake it work for you. A typical beginner program will include two to three\\xa0days of cardio and two days of strength training. You can also combine these workouts if you do not have five days to devote to exercise.\\n\\nLearn how to monitor your intensity.\\xa0Most beginners will start working out at a moderate intensity. That means you\\'re at about a Level 5 on the perceived exertion scale. Or you can use the talk test: If you can carry on a\\xa0somewhat breathy conversation while you\\'re working out, that\\'s usually a moderate intensity.\\n\\nSample Weekly Workout Plan\\n\\nThis sample program is appropriate for someone just getting started with—or getting back to—exercise. Remember that it is just a suggestion and you may find that different workouts work better for you (for example, swimming instead of cycling).\\n\\nRemember to start every workout with 5 to 10 minutes of light cardio and stretching, and to cool down with flexibility exercises.\\n\\nAim to include multiple planes of motion in your workout. Add lateral moves by doing side lunges or shuffles in your warm-up, for example, and incorporate rotation by throwing cross-body punches while walking.\\n\\nMonday\\n\\nBeginner Stationary Bike Workout\\n\\nBeginner Walking Workout\\n\\nBeginner Elliptical Workout\\n\\nTuesday\\n\\nBeginner Total Body Strength\\n\\nBeginner Total Body Strength Level 2\\n\\nBeginner Total Body Strength Level 3\\n\\nWednesday\\n\\nRest or gentle yoga/stretching\\n\\nThursday\\n\\nCardio: 10 to 30 minutes; do the same workout you did on Monday or a new one\\n\\nFriday\\n\\nTotal body strength and core training; repeat Tuesday\\'s workout to practice the exercises and build the strength and endurance to do more\\n\\nSaturday\\n\\nRest or optional cardio: Do something less structured, like taking a walk or a leisurely bike ride\\n\\nSunday\\n\\nRest\\n\\nIntermediate Workout Schedule\\n\\nIf you\\'ve been exercising for at least three months consistently, you typically fall into this category. If your goal is to lose weight, you want to work your way up to 20 to 60 minutes of cardio about five or more times a week.4\\n\\nThis is a great time to try interval training once or twice a week, which will give you more bang for your workout buck.\\n\\nDon\\'t skimp on strength training. It builds muscle and boosts metabolism.1 Your strength training schedule will depend on what type of workouts you\\'re doing (e.g., total-body training or a split routine). And, when possible, be sure to use a mirror to check and adjust your form.\\n\\nYou can do cardio and weight training on the same day. It is best to do the workout that best matches your goals first. If your goal is to improve muscular strength or size, perform your strength training routine first. If your goal is to work on cardiovascular health, do cardio first. If you will be doing an intense or demanding weight training session, always perform it first so reduce the risks of injury from fatigue leading to form mistakes.5\\n\\nThe following schedule includes a split routine for your upper and lower body, allowing you to focus more attention on each muscle group.\\n\\nIt is not necessary to do split routines, and other types of weight lifting routines may be better for you, such as full-body, body part splits, push-pull-leg workouts, and more.\\n\\nWeekly Split Workout Plan\\n\\nMonday\\n\\n30-Minute Cardio Medley Workout + Upper Body Training + Stretch\\n\\nTuesday\\n\\n30-Minute Treadmill Interval Workout + Core Training + Stretch\\n\\nWednesday\\n\\nLow Impact Cardio Blast Workout (two circuits) + Lower body strength + Lower body stretch\\n\\nThursday\\n\\nRest or gentle yoga/stretching\\n\\nFriday\\n\\nTotal Body Strength or Circuit Training\\n\\nSaturday\\n\\nCardio Endurance Workout\\n\\nSunday\\n\\nRest\\n\\nBenefits of a 5x5 Workout\\n\\nAdvanced Workout Schedule\\n\\nIf you\\'ve been exercising regularly for several months and do a variety of activities, you fall into this category. To continue making progress and beat plateaus, you\\'ll need to add intensity and variety.\\n\\nMix up your workouts to keep things interesting. As an advanced exerciser, you have lots of options for scheduling your workouts. If you want to focus on strength and muscle, you can split your strength routine even further, doing push exercises one day and pull exercises the next.\\n\\nYou can also make your cardio more intense. You can do this by incorporating high-intensity interval training, high-intensity circuit training, or other advanced techniques to burn calories and build endurance.\\n\\nRest and recovery are critical. The real focus should be on allowing your body to rest between high-intensity workouts. Too much intensity can cause injury, overtraining, and burnout.3\\n\\nWeekly Split Workout Plan\\n\\nMonday\\n\\nChest Shoulders, and Triceps + HIIT Cardio\\n\\nTuesday\\n\\nLower Body and Core\\n\\nWednesday\\n\\nBack and Biceps + Boredom Buster Cardio\\n\\nThursday\\n\\nRest or gentle yoga/stretching\\n\\nFriday\\n\\nTotal Body Blast\\n\\nSaturday\\n\\nHIIT Tabata Cardio Workout\\n\\nSunday\\n\\nRest\\n\\nA Word From Verywell\\n\\nThese are just examples and won\\'t fit every exerciser. The most important thing to keep in mind is to start where you are, not where you want to be. It often takes weeks, even months, of experimenting with different types of exercise and schedules to find something that fits your goals, schedule, and fitness level.\\n\\nKeep in mind that you don\\'t have to follow the same schedule every week. In fact, most people have to change each week depending on how they are feeling or what\\'s going on in their lives. The best thing you can do for yourself is to stay flexible and remember there\\'s no perfect workout program for everyone.\\n\\nFrequently Asked Questions\\n\\nHow many days per week should you work out?\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nHow many days per week you work out is a personal choice, but it is wise to get in some activity every day. Strength training should be performed two to three days per week. You can also perform cardio on those days or alternate days. Active recovery work such as walking, swimming, cycling, etc., can be performed every day.6\\n\\nWhich is the best way to split your workout?\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nThere is no optimal way to split your workout. You can perform full-body routines, or split them between upper and lower body. There are other types of splits such as push-pull-legs or specific small body part splits as well. Choose what works best for you and your schedule. Monitor your progress and change your routine if you aren\\'t seeing results.\\n\\nWhat body parts should you work out each day?\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nYou do not have to work out particular body parts each day, but it is wise to work each muscle group at least two times per week. This could mean full body workouts two days per week, or upper and lower body splits four days per week, for instance.\\n\\n6 Sources\\n\\n\\nVerywell Fit uses only high-quality sources, including peer-reviewed studies, to support the facts within our articles.

Maybe you can find the hotel gym, but I bet it’s terrible! It probably has 2 machines, a broken treadmill, and no free weights.\\n\\nUgh.\\n\\nInstead, how about a 20-min workout you can do in the room itself! Utilize the furniture to its full potential.\\n\\nHotel Workout Level 1:\\n\\nBodyweight squats: 20 reps\\n\\nIncline push-ups: 15 reps (feet on floor, hands on edge of bed or desk)\\n\\nOne-arm luggage rows: 10 reps (each arm, use your suitcase as your weight)\\n\\nReverse crunches: 10 reps\\n\\nHotel Workout Level 2:\\n\\nOverhead Squats: 25 reps\\n\\nPush-Ups: 20 reps\\n\\nInverted Rows using the desk in your hotel room: 10 reps\\n\\nReverse Crunches: 15 reps\\n\\nSet the alarm clock to 15 minutes from now and see how many circuits you can do!\\n\\nCheck out our full post on hotel circuits if you want Level 3!\\n\\nWe have a LOT of business travelers throughout the Rebellion!

You can do a complete routine right in your own home!\\n\\nHIIT is just following a specific regimen where you vary your speeds and intensity throughout a shorter run, swim, bike, or row.\\n\\nUnless you have a giant backyard, running at home might be tough.\\n\\nBut you know what doesn’t require a lot of room?\\n\\nBurpees!\\n\\nTo complete a burpee:\\n\\nStart standing up, then squat down and kick your legs out.\\n\\nDo a push-up, bring your legs back in, and explode up into a jump.\\n\\nFor a HIIT workout, try to do 20 repetitions, then rest for two minutes.\\n\\nRepeat until you hate yourself.\\n\\nCheck out our full guide on How to Start Interval Training for some more ideas on HIIT workouts.\\n\\nYou can also check out our post “The 20-Min HIIT Workout for Home” for another living-room-friendly interval routine!\\n\\nHome Workout #5: Attack of the Angry Birds\\n\\nThe Angry Birds Workout is designed to be done when you have 5 or 10 minutes to kill.\\n\\nSort of like playing Angry Birds…\\n\\nHere’s how The Angry Birds Workout Plan works: it’s deceptively simple – only four major movements.\\n\\nBodyweight squats\\n\\nPush-ups\\n\\nPull-ups (or inverted rows)\\n\\nPlanks\\n\\nIf you don’t have time to run through the whole sequence, no problem!\\n\\nDepending on how much time you have during the day, you can do your whole workout at once, or break up your training into four different sessions throughout the day (with each session being ONE of the exercises).\\n\\nHere’s a sample day for your No-Equipment Workout:\\n\\nWake up, do 40 jumping jacks to warm up, and then do bodyweight squats.\\n\\nAt lunch, you grab your suitcase (if you’re at work, milk jug if you’re at home) and do inverted rows.\\n\\nAfter work, you do another 50 jumping jacks and then do your push-ups.\\n\\nAfter dinner, you do your planks while watching TV.\\n\\nYou could even split it up over two days if needed, but the goal would be to do it the whole sequence at once.\\n\\nThe main Angry Birds Workout article describes in detail Levels 1-6, but here’s Level 3 for you:\\n\\nBodyweight squats: 50 reps\\n\\nPush-ups: 50 reps\\n\\nPull-ups: 10 reps\\n\\nPlanks: 3-minute hold\\n\\nOnce you’ve done the complete routine, you have my permission to whip out your phone and play the actual game!\\n\\nHome Workout #6: Train like Batman\\n\\nWe love the Caped Crusader here at Nerd Fitness, so naturally we have The Batman Bodyweight Workout for you to try!\\n\\nBonus points if you somehow do this no-equipment workout in a cave, as that’s how Bruce Wayne would roll.[1]\\n\\nThis workout is separated into two days for you.\\n\\nHere’s a video for the first day:\\n\\nBatman No-Equipment Workout Day 1:\\n\\nRolling squat tuck-up jumps: 5 reps\\n\\nSide to side push-ups: 5 reps\\n\\nModified headstand push-ups: 5 reps\\n\\nJump pull-up with tuck / Pull-up with Tuck-up: 5 reps\\n\\nHandstands against wall: 8 seconds\\n\\nHere’s a video for the second day:\\n\\nBatman No-Equipment Workout Day 2:\\n\\n‘180 Degree’ jump turns: 5 reps\\n\\nTuck front lever hold: 8 seconds\\n\\nTuck back lever hold: 8 seconds\\n\\nLow frog hold: 8 seconds\\n\\nThis is a relatively advanced workout already, but if you want to progress to the next level, check out the main Batman Bodyweight Workout for tips on how to do just that.\\n\\nJoin our free weekly newsletter! It would make Alfred Pennyworth proud.\\n\\nHome Workout #7: The PLP Progression\\n\\nThe PLP is a progressive program in which you complete one additional rep of three exercises – Pull-Ups, Lunges, and Push-Ups – every day, for two months.\\n\\nNOTE: This is NOT a beginner program, and should not be attempted unless you have been training consistently and can do multiple repetitions of pull-ups and push-ups with great form.\\n\\nLike this perfect push-up:\\n\\nAnd this perfect pull-up:\\n\\nHere’s how the PLP Progression works:\\n\\nDay 1:\\n\\nPull-ups: 10 reps\\n\\nPush-ups: 10 reps\\n\\nLunges: 10 reps (each leg)\\n\\nDay 2:\\n\\nPull-ups: 11 reps\\n\\nPush-ups: 11 reps\\n\\nLunges: 11 reps (each leg)\\n\\nDay 3:\\n\\nPull-ups: 12 reps\\n\\nPush-ups: 12 reps\\n\\nLunges: 12 reps (each leg)\\n\\nHow long do you keep doing this?\\n\\nAs originally envisioned by Chad Waterbury, the PLP Workout lasts 60 days.[3]\\n\\nYeah…by the end of it you’ll be doing more than 50 pull-ups.\\n\\nThere are two versions:\\n\\nIf you can do 10 straight pull-ups: Start day 1 with 10 reps of each.\\n\\nIf you cannot do 10 straight pull-ups: Start day 1 with 1 rep of each.\\n\\nComplete your required reps each day in as many sets as you need, whenever you need to. The goal is to do it in as few sets as possible, but enough so that you can complete each rep with proper form.\\n\\nWant to learn more?
