Crowder from the United States\\n\\nMilitary Academy (USMA) Department of Physical Education for his work in assisting us in this project. He graciously allowed us to edit his work on cardio-respiratory training in order to tailor it towards ROTC cadets who have varying fitness needs at over 270 schools. Cadet Command would not have been successful in writing this Fitness Handbook without his help and the help of other fitness experts at the USMA and from the United States Army Physical Fitness School.\\n\\nBefore You Begin\\n\\nIt is imperative that cadets learn an easy way to reduce the likelihood of injury while\\n\\nusing this Fitness Handbook. Cadets need to recognize that they have an increased risk of lower body injuries than upper body injuries during summer training events. The leading causes of this are improperly sized or poorly broken-in boots and inadequate running shoes. Boots that hurt or uncomfortable to you at school will cause significantly more discomfort and increase the chance of injury during rigorous summer training events like the National Advanced Leadership Camp, Airborne School or Air Assault School. A broken in pair of boots should feel as comfortable as your most comfortable pair of shoes. To put it simply, you should be able to walk or run in them comfortably.\\n\\nSimilarly running shoes should fit comfortably and not show significant tread wear.\\n\\nRunning places different wear on your shoes than walking does. Using shoes you walk in for running can place undo stress on your lower body. This stress can increase the risk of injury. Field Manual 21-20 divides running shoes into three categories. Select an impact control shoe if you have high arches or notice that your running shoes tend to wear unevenly on the outside edge. Select a motion control shoe if you have flat feet or notice that excessive wear on both the extreme outside and inside of the sole of the running shoe. Select a balanced shoe if you have normal arches or only see wear on the outside sole beneath the ankle.\\n\\nOther factors that reduce the likelihood of injuries include adequate warm-ups prior to high intensity exercise, proper nutrition and hydration, maintaining recovery periods following exercise, and cool-down periods concluding the exercise.\\n\\nEditors Ms. Sheila Visconti\\n\\nMajor Paul Baker CPT Ellis Goins\\n\\n3\\n\\nPhysical Fitness\\n\\nTRAINING VARIABLES\\n\\nBefore explaining what a physical fitness program should look like, there are some basic\\n\\nterms that must be discussed. These principals apply to all programs in general and must be addressed in the development of any fitness program.\\n\\nINTENSITY – The amount of effort put into each workout, usually measured by heartbeats per minute. For the maximum benefit in each workout, plan on exercising at a minimum of 70 percent of the heart rate reserve. There are several scientific ways to your heart rate reserve. The simplest way is to begin with you maximum heart rate (220-Age). Next, measure your resting heart rate. The heart rate reserve is found by Max heart rate - resting heart rate. To train at 70% of the heart rate reserve you would multiply 70% by the heart rate reserve and then add your resting heart rate. For a 20 year old with a resting heart rate of 60 to dDetermineing your training heart rate in beats per minute would be 70% x Heart Rate Reserve =.70 x (200-60) + 60 (Resting Heart Rate) = a training heart rate of 158 beats per min.\\n\\nDURATION – The length each exercise period should last. There has been a great deal of research on this topic. Most experts believe that when working on your cardiovascular endurance a minimum of 20 to 30 minutes is needed to obtain maximum benefit. This holds true for the majority of the population. The only notable exception occurs for long distance or endurance athletes (e.g. marathon runners or triathletes).\\n\\nFREQUENCY – The number of workouts one should have per week. Once again experts\\n\\nagree that the average person requires a minimum of three workouts per week to improve their current level of fitness. Working out less frequently will only maintain a level of fitness; it will not improve the level of fitness. When exercising only three times a week, each period should be medium to high intensity. Exercising with consistent frequency can also be referred to as REGULARITY. Exercise must be done regularly to produce a training effect. Sporadic exercise may cause more harm in the form of injury than benefit from exercise. The same is true for extremely intense workouts. They may create injuries.\\n\\nRECOVERY – Do not work the same muscle groups hard day after day. Muscles\\n\\nneed recovery time. People frequently misunderstand this point. Providing inadequate recovery can explain the reason why most people see little or no gain from excessive exercise. You can work the same muscle groups each day, however, you should work hard one day and easy the next. This is a critical point because this fitness program is based on a six days a week exercise program.\\n\\nGENERAL ADAPTATION PRINCIPAL (GAP) – Muscles as well as your cardiovascular system in the body will adapt to the increasing stress placed upon it through exercise. To see gains in a fitness program one must stress the existing muscular and cardiovascular systems. This can also be called the OVERLOAD principal. For a muscle to increase in strength, the workload during exercise must be larger than what it normally experiences.\\n\\n4\\n\\nSPECIFICITY – There are several different exercises and events that can develop your\\n\\nmuscular strength as well as cardiovascular fitness. To increase the number of push-ups you can do, simply increase upper body strength through a number of strength exercises and weights. However, the best way to improve push-ups requires doing push-ups. Similarly one can improve cardiovascular fitness by biking swimming, or walking. However, if the goal remains an improved ability to run, the best exercise will be running.\\n\\nMAJOR COMPONENTS OF PHYSICAL FITNESS – There are several components of\\n\\nany fitness program. The three major components of most programs are flexibility, strength, muscular endurance, and cardiovascular endurance. These components are the essential elements of the Army Physical Fitness Program.\\n\\nHow to Use These Workout Programs\\n\\nThese programs are designed as four week plans. Each program has a workout A & B.\\n\\nAlternate workouts daily for 6 days, then rest. For example, perform workout A on Monday, Wednesday, and Friday; perform workout B on Tuesday, Thursday, and Saturday. Different muscles are trained in workouts A & B, which means you are training each muscle group 3 days per week. Rest Sunday. Work cardiovascular exercises into your workouts at least 3 times per week. You may attempt to eventually work up to doing cardio 6 days a week using the hard/easy technique mentioned under the recovery principle.\\n\\nFitness Assessment\\n\\nBefore starting any new fitness program it is important to assess ones abilities. This\\n\\nincludes knowing strengths as well as weaknesses. Ideally, a fitness program would improve weak areas and maintain or improve strength areas. However, before explaining the diagnostic test there are other important factors and preferences that should be identified. These factors and preferences may include the time of day to workout, how much time is available each day to workout, individual or team sports, and finally the goal of the fitness program.\\n\\nThe questionnaire attached (FORM 1-1) is intended to give a fitness trainer the basics\\n\\nthey need to personalize a fitness program that will works.\\n\\n5\\n\\nFitness Assessment Questionnaire\\n\\nNAME__________________________________ AGE___________ DATE________________\\n\\nACADEMIC SCHEDULE: Monday________________________________________________ (this Semester) Tuesday________________________________________________ Wednesday_____________________________________________ Thursday_______________________________________________ Friday__________________________________________________ Saturday________________________________________________\\n\\nEXERCISE HABITS/ PREFERENCES (Select One) I ____________________________ to exercise and ________________access to a gym (like, sometimes like, never want ) I like to workout _________________________________ (alone, in a small group, in a large group) I have ___________________discipline to stick to a fitness program ( a little, some, a lot of) I need ___________________________to stick to my fitness program (no help, some help, a lot of help) I ____________________________ to lift weights (like, have tried, have never tried) I prefer to ________________________ for my cardiovascular endurance training (run, walk, bike, swim, skate)\\n\\n(have, do not have)\\n\\nGOALS I want to:\\n\\nA.

This diagnostic test is composed of 6 events. The six events are as follows and will be performed in order. A brief warm-up period will precede the administration of the test. The warm up should consist of a combination of stretching exercises and jogging in place for 3 to 5 minutes.. The warm-up may consists of jogging in place for 3 minutes, starting slowly and increasing intensity to warm the body’s muscles and ligaments. Light stretching should follow the warm-up.\\n\\n1. First event: Bench Press. Cadets will perform a 1-rep maximum of this exercise to determine chest, shoulders, and triceps strength. A cadet should begin with a weight which they are confident they can press. Allow at least 1 minute rest between attempts. The weight will be increased at the cadet’s request and he will perform the exercise again. Allow no more than 5 attempts to reach the 1-rep maximum. Any failed attempt terminates the exercise. The last correct repetition will count as the 1-rep maximum.\\n\\nFigure 1\\n\\n(1) Equipment. Flat weight bench. At least 1, preferably 2 spotters. Lifting gloves are authorized. Bench press shirts are not authorized. (2) Performance. Lie in a supine position on a flat bench with your legs positioned at the sides of the bench and your feet flat on the floor. Using a handgrip that is about 6 inches wider than your shoulder width, bring the barbell to arms length above the chest but in line with the shoulders (see fig 1). If two spotters are available they will position themselves on each side of the bar. The spotters may assist in the liftoff. If only one spotter is available, he/she will be at the lifter’s head to assist. Once the bar is at the start position the spotter will release the bar. Lower the barbell to the chest and make a definite pause. As soon as momentum has ceased the grader will yell press. Press the barbell to the start position to complete the repetition. The spotter will not touch the barbell during the repetition\\n\\n7\\n\\nunless absolutely necessary. If the spotter has to assist the lifter during the repetition the event is terminated.\\n\\nUpper Body Strength = 1 rep max in pounds divided by body weight in pounds\\n\\n5 4 3 2 1\\n\\nMales greater than 1.26 1.17 - 1.25 .97 - 1.16 .88 - .96 less than .87\\n\\n5 4 3 2 1\\n\\nFemales greater than .78 .72 - .77 .59 - .71 .53 - .58 less than .52\\n\\n2. Second Event: Push-up. Cadets will perform as many push-ups as they can to determine the muscular endurance of the chest shoulder, and triceps muscles.\\n\\n(1) Equipment. Flat area.\\n\\n(2) Performance. On the command \\'get set,\\' assume the front-leaning rest position by placing your hands where they are comfortable for you. Your feet may be together or up to 12 inches apart. When viewed from the side, your body should form a generally straight line from your shoulders to your ankles. On the command \\'go,\\' begin the push-up by bending your elbows and lowering your entire body as a single unit until your upper arms are at least parallel to the ground. Then, return to the starting position by raising your entire body until your arms are fully extended. Your body must remain rigid in a generally straight line and move as a unit while performing each repetition. At the end of each repetition, the scorer will state the number of repetitions you have completed correctly. If you fail to keep your body generally straight, to lower your whole body until your upper arms are at least parallel to the ground, or to extend your arms completely, that repetition will not count, and the scorer will repeat the number of the last correctly performed repetition. An altered, front-leaning rest position is the only authorized rest position. That is, you may sag in the middle or flex your back. When flexing your back, you may bend your knees, but not to such an extent that you are supporting most of your body weight with your legs. If this occurs, your performance will be terminated. You must return to, and pause in, the correct starting position before continuing. If you rest on the ground or raise either hand or foot from the ground, your performance will be terminated. You may reposition your hands and/or feet during the event as long as they remain in contact with the ground at all times. Correct performance is important. You will do as many push-ups as you can; there is no time limit.\\n\\n3. Third Event: Curl-up. Cadets will perform the curl-up exercise to assess abdominal strength and endurance.\\n\\n(1) Equipment. Mat, Ruler, metronome, stop watch\\n\\n(2) Performance. Start with your back on the floor with your knees bent at a 90 degree angle (feet 12 to 18 inches away from the buttocks). Place your arms by your sides with palms down on the floor, elbows locked, and fingers straight. The grader will place a ruler or draw a line 12 cm away from the longest finger tip and set metronome to a cadence of 50 beats per\\n\\n8\\n\\nminute. Curl your head and upper back upward, keeping arms stiff, reaching forward along the floor to touch the line. Your fingers, feet and buttocks must stay on the floor during the entire curl-up. Slide the palms of the hands (extended arms) along the mat until the fingertips of both hands just touch the 12 cm line. Keep the arms straight. Lower your body until the back is flat against the ground. Perform the movement following the cadence of the metronome (25 curl-ups per minute). Take the same amount of time to perform the raising and lowering phases. The test score is the number of complete touches on the line until the rhythm cannot be followed. If you do not have a Metronome, conduct standard bent knee sit-ups with your hands crossed over your chest. Do as many as you can in a 2 minute period.\\n\\nAGE\\n\\nMale 15-19\\n\\n20-29\\n\\n30-39\\n\\nExcellent\\n\\n>74\\n\\n>74\\n\\n>74\\n\\nAbove Average\\n\\n35 - 74\\n\\n31 - 74\\n\\n36 - 74\\n\\nAverage\\n\\n24 - 34\\n\\n24 - 30\\n\\n26 - 35\\n\\nBelow Average\\n\\n8 - 23\\n\\n4 - 23\\n\\n0 - 23\\n\\nAGE\\n\\nFemale 15-19\\n\\n20-29\\n\\n30-39\\n\\nExcellent\\n\\n>74\\n\\n>69\\n\\n>54\\n\\nAbove Average\\n\\n30 - 74\\n\\n30 - 69\\n\\n28 - 54\\n\\nAverage\\n\\n24 - 29\\n\\n21 - 29\\n\\n15 - 27\\n\\nBelow Average\\n\\n10 - 23\\n\\n5 - 20\\n\\n0 - 14\\n\\nFourth Event: Step Test. Cadets will perform the 3-minute step test to determine cardiovascular endurance. (1) Equipment. Metronome, 12 inch step, stopwatch. (2) Performance. Cadets will step up (1-2) and down (3-4) in cadence with the metronome which is set at 96 beats per minute (4 clicks = one step cycle) for a stepping rate of 24 steps per minute. Cadets will step up and down on the 12-inch bench for 3 minutes. Immediately after the 3-minute stepping exercise, the cadet is to sit down and within 5 seconds, the tester is to take the subject\\'s heart rate for one minute. The total one-minute post-exercise heart rate is the subject\\'s score for the test. Compare to YMCA Norms below. In the event you do not have a Metronome, the tester will count one step-two step-three step-four step in an attempt to come close to 96 beats per minute. Needless to say, this will result in a less accurate evaluation. Example: A 18- year old female performs the step test with a final heart rate of 95.

Professors of Military Science & Leadership (PMS) should administer the diagnostic test in the assessment phase of the fitness program development. Use the Diagnostic Test Score Card provided. The next diagnostic test should occur no later than week six. Subsequent diagnostic tests should be given every six weeks. After the initial diagnostic it is acceptable to substitute the APFT as a diagnostic tool. PMSs or their designated fitness expert should regularly monitor the fitness logs of cadets and provide guidance as needed.\\n\\nDiagnostic Test Score Card\\n\\nLast Name\\n\\nFirst Name\\n\\nMI\\n\\nGender M or F\\n\\nAge\\n\\nHeight _____inches\\n\\nWeight ______lbs\\n\\nBody Fat ______%\\n\\nBench Press\\n\\nLift 1_____ 2_____ 3_____ 4_____ 5_____\\n\\n1-RM = lbs\\n\\n1 Rep Maximum Divided by Bodyweight =\\n\\nPush-up\\n\\nRepetitions_______\\n\\nCurl-up\\n\\nRepetitions_______\\n\\nStep Test\\n\\n1-minute post-exercise heart rate _______beats\\n\\nSit & Reach\\n\\nDistance from toes (+ or -) ________cm\\n\\nIllinois Agility Run Test\\n\\nTime____________\\n\\n13\\n\\nFlexibility\\n\\nFlexibility is an important component of your fitness program. Many activity- related\\n\\ninjuries have their root in lack of flexibility. Think of your muscles as rubber bands. When they are cold they are rigid and brittle. When warm they stretch and retract more easily. Conducting a good warm-up prior to exercising and a good cool-down upon completion will help prevent injury and reduce muscle soreness.\\n\\nNo matter what your current fitness level, you should always begin your exercise sessions\\n\\nwith a warm-up. A good warm-up sequence is as follows. Jog in place or a specified location for one to two minutes. This causes a gradual increase in the heart rate, blood pressure, circulation, and increases the temperature of the active muscles. Next, perform slow joint rotation exercises (for example, arm circles, knee/ankle rotations) to gradually increase the joint\\'s range of motion. Work each major joint for 5 to 10 seconds. Finally, stretch the muscles to be used during the upcoming activity slowly. This will \"loosen up\" muscles and tendons so they can achieve greater ranges of motion with less risk of injury. Hold each stretch position for 10 to 15 seconds, and do not bounce or bob.\\n\\nImmediately following your exercise session stretch as part of your cool-down. After\\n\\nexercising, when your muscles are their warmest is the best time to improve your flexibility. Do not limit flexibility exercises to warm-up and cool-down only. Take the time to dedicate sessions to flexibility. Stretching throughout the day is also a great idea. Stretching is one form of exercise that takes very little time relative to the benefits gained. Some of the more common flexibility exercises are listed under the flexibility exercises. Assume all stretching positions slowly until you feel tension or slight discomfort. Hold each position for at least 10 to 15 seconds during the warm-up and cool-down. Developmental stretching to improve flexibility requires holding each stretch for 30 seconds or longer.\\n\\n14\\n\\nPROGRAM DESCRIPTION\\n\\nThese Fitness Work-out sheets are designed to be implemented on a workout plan A\\n\\nfollowed the next day by a workout plan B. Workout A will focus on lower body strength and endurance while workout plan B will focus on upper body strength and endurance. Both days incorporate some abdominal work. Remember it is important to maintain a period of recovery for the abdominal muscles. Trying to overachieve early in a workout program can lead to injury. The reason there is a range within the abdominal exercises is to promote recovery. If you are providing yourself adequate time to recover, over time you should see your abilities increasing.\\n\\nThe cardiorespiratory workouts need to be included into the program. If the program\\n\\nselected is exclusively running (e.g. group run, fartlek, or interval) it should replace the A workout plan. However, if you choose a guerrilla or grass drill workout plan it could substitute for either the A or the B Workout plan. The minimum frequency of cardiorespiratory workouts is two to three per week. For borderline runners the number of workouts may be as high as three to five per week and may consist of a combination of intervals, grass, and guerrilla drills. The determining factor for the intensity and frequency of cardiorespiratory training will depend on the ability and fitness level of the cadet and the intensity of the workout.\\n\\nFor some reason if you miss A workout then the next workout would be the A workout.\\n\\nIn a week you should expect to do a total of six workouts per week.\\n\\n15\\n\\nThe Road to Fitness\\n\\nWORKOUT A\\n\\nEXERCISE\\n\\nSQUAT Set 1 12-15 reps Set 2 12-15 reps Set 3 12-15 reps LEG CURLS Set 1 12-15 reps Set 2 12-15 reps Set 3 12-15 reps Deadlifts Set 1 12-15 reps Set 2 12-15 reps Set 3 12-15 reps LEG EXTENSION Set 1 12-15 reps Set 2 12-15 reps Set 3 12-15 reps CALF RAISES Set 1 12-15 reps Set 2 12-15 reps Set 3 12-15 reps\\n\\nWEEK 1 WEEK 2 WEEK 3 WEEK 4 Weight/Reps Weight/Reps\\n\\nWeight/Reps\\n\\nWeight/Reps\\n\\nWeight/Reps\\n\\n/ / /\\n\\n/ / /\\n\\n/ / /\\n\\nWeight/Reps / / / Weight/Reps / / / Weight/Reps / / / Weight/Reps\\n\\nWeight/Reps / / / Weight/Reps / / / Weight/Reps / / / Weight/Reps\\n\\nWeight/Reps\\n\\nWeight/Reps\\n\\nWeight/Reps\\n\\n/ / /\\n\\n/ / /\\n\\n/ / /\\n\\n/ / / ABDOMINAL\\n\\nWeight/Reps\\n\\n/ / /\\n\\n/ / / Weight/Reps / / /\\n\\n/ / / Weight/Reps / / /\\n\\n/ / /\\n\\nWeight/Reps\\n\\n/ / /\\n\\nSIT-UP 1 minute SWISS-BALL CRUNCH 1 minute REVERSE CRUNCH 1 minute\\n\\nBeginner Routine: Do one set of 12-15 reps of each exercise. Use a weight that you can lift at least 12 times. When you complete 15 reps, increase the weight at your next workout. Move quickly from exercise to exercise, resting at most 30 seconds between exercises unless you are exceeding your training heart rate. If you are, increase the rest period between exercises. As you progress, you should be able to decrease the rest between exercises while maintaining your training heart rate.\\n\\nSPEED: Perform each rep deliberately slower than what seems like your natural speed. This keeps your muscles under tension longer and helps build them faster.\\n\\n16\\n\\nEXERCISE\\n\\nThe Road to Fitness WORKOUT B WEEK 1\\n\\nWEEK 2\\n\\nWEEK 3\\n\\nWEEK 4\\n\\nBENCH PRESS Set 1 12-15 reps Set 2 12-15 reps Set 3 12-15 reps\\n\\nINCLINE BENCH PRESS Set 1 12-15 reps Set 2 12-15 reps Set 3 12-15 reps DUMBELL SHOULDER PRESS\\n\\nWeight/Reps\\n\\n/ / /\\n\\nWeight/Reps\\n\\n/ / /\\n\\nWeight/Reps\\n\\nWeight/Reps\\n\\n/ / / Weight/Reps\\n\\n/ / / Weight/Reps\\n\\nWeight/Reps\\n\\n/ / / Weight/Reps\\n\\n/ / / Weight/Reps\\n\\nWeight/Reps\\n\\n/ / / Weight/Reps\\n\\n/ / / Weight/Reps\\n\\nSet 1 12-15 reps Set 2 12-15 reps Set 3 12-15 reps\\n\\nLATERAL RAISES\\n\\n/ / /\\n\\nWeight/Reps\\n\\n/ / / Weight/Reps\\n\\n/ / / Weight/Reps\\n\\n/ / / Weight/Reps\\n\\nSet 1 12-15 reps Set 2 12-15 reps Set 3 12-15 reps\\n\\nDIPS Set 1 12-15 reps Set 2 12-15 reps Set 3 12-15 reps\\n\\n/ / /\\n\\nWeight/Reps\\n\\n/ / /\\n\\n/ / / Weight/Reps\\n\\n/ / /\\n\\n/ / / Weight/Reps\\n\\n/ / /\\n\\n/ / / Weight/Reps\\n\\n/ / /\\n\\nWEIGHTED SIT-UP REVERSE CRUNCH BODY TWIST\\n\\nABDOMINAL 15-25 15-25 15-25\\n\\nBeginner Goals: Exercise consistently with short focused workouts.

Americans are getting unhealthier each year. Health-related disease such as diabetes, hypertension, cardiovascular disorders, and various forms of cancer are at an all-time high. We must consider the effect of excess weight on our joints and backs, not to mention the psychological effects on our self-esteem and confidence!\\n\\nHave you ever noticed that people who are active or play sports always seem to be able to do more things – they just appear to enjoy life more than their sedentary, unfit counterparts. Of course, fit people generally do not smoke, so they are less likely to get cancer than smokers. They generally don\\'t carry a lot of excess body fat so they suffer fewer heart attacks than those unfit. Fit people have stronger lungs, muscles, joints, bones, immune system, and healthier hearts. Their cholesterol levels and blood pressure measurements are better. With these facts in mind, you can see why we are so passionate about the benefits of exercise and a healthy lifestyle.\\n\\nMost people recognize the benefits of exercise and eating well. Many have good intentions and decide to make some changes. In fact, Americans have no problem initiating the process. We have done it numerous times. We tend to lose the same fat over and over again. Our struggle lies in the challenge of keeping the weight off. Most people who undertake an exercise and nutrition program have not really taken the time to fully understand the complexity of the process. If you are going to be successful at initiating these major changes in your life and, more importantly, maintaining the changes, you are going to have to establish a very strong foundation for success.\\n\\nThere are literally hundreds of exercises, nutrition, fat loss and health books on the shelves at book stores; with most of these books, you read them and then they go back on the bookshelf. By the time you start to initiate any of the changes, you have forgotten what those changes were in the first place and you have probably lost the motivation anyway. This manual is an interactive tool. You will regularly be asked to take action towards your goals. You will be asked to answer questions and complete homework drills. This will force you to implement the information immediately and keep your goals at the top of your priorities.\\n\\nResearch demonstrates that the safest and most effective program for optimal health and ideal weight management is a program that combines exercise and a healthy diet. This workbook will focus on that combination. You will learn the most effective exercise and nutrition tips for improving your overall health, fitness and energy levels. Research also shows that you must be involved in the process to enhance success. You know your body and life better than anyone. It’s never successful if we just blindly tell a client what to do without considering their individual scenario. So we need you to help us help you! We are firm believers that there is no quick-fix solution. If you want something enough, expect to put forth a bit of effort. You know what they say - if anything is worth getting, it is worth working for! So, it will not be a ‘walk in the park’, but we can guarantee that it is probably not going to be as difficult as you would imagine. Every drill in this book will take you closer to success. Every homework assignment you complete will give you the confidence and self-esteem to know you can accomplish the next goal. It is all about \"Results Momentum\". If we ask you to do something – even a very small task – when you complete it, you have succeeded. This will give you momentum so the next goal becomes that much easier. If you do not do the task – no matter how insignificant, it makes it easier to skip out on other tasks – perhaps those that are much more important to your success. Think of this process as a series of very small baby steps and each one takes you closer and closer to your PERSONAL BEST!\\n\\nLet\\'s get started right away. Remember, we have full confidence that you can do this because we know \"If you think you can, you can!\" Plus we are here to support you throughout the entire process.\\n\\n9\\n\\nFitness & Training Makeover Commitment\\n\\nThe purpose of this agreement is to serve as a reminder of the commitment that you have made to yourself and to provide a list of the health behaviors that we will help you to adopt over the next few weeks and for the rest of your life. This page is an overview of the program expectations. In the rest of this manual we will explain details and help you to understand why each of these areas are important to your overall health and success. Consider this a sneak peak. We welcome you to begin tackling any of these areas immediately. You have made one of the best decisions of your life!\\n\\nAn Optimal Health and Fitness Program includes:\\n\\n\\uf0a9\\uf020 Exercising aerobically 3-6 days each week for 20-60 minutes each session at various levels of intensity. Using a Heart rate monitor will keep you honest. Activities like walking, jogging, cycling, swimming, rowing, hiking, stair-climbing, or Group classes will do the trick.\\n\\n\\uf0a9\\uf020 Conditioning your muscles with resistance training workouts for a minimum of two times per week. One set of 8-12 reps of a variety of exercises for 20-60 minutes is perfect! Or just workout with your trainer and they’ll make sure you meet this requirement. Our Group Muscle Conditioning programs will help you achieve this goal also.\\n\\n\\uf0a9\\uf020 Eating a balanced diet that is high in fiber content.\\n\\n\\uf0a9\\uf020 Eating 5 vegetable servings and 3 fruit servings each day.\\n\\n\\uf0a9\\uf020 Drinking 10—8ounce glasses of water each day. Drink water before and with each meal and snack.\\n\\nPurchasing a Jumbo size water bottle will help you adhere to this tip.\\n\\n\\uf0a9\\uf020 Planning your meals so that you eat 3 small meals and 2 small snacks each day. Try to eat every 3 hours.\\n\\n\\uf0a9\\uf020 Avoiding eating anything high in fat or calories 3 hours before bedtime.\\n\\n\\uf0a9\\uf020 Controlling portion sizes. If you need more assistance regarding exact caloric requirements, visit our website at www.nwwomensfitness.com Click on the “Member Zone”. Then click on “Cool Fitness Tools”. There is a calculator that you can use to more accurately estimate your calorie and protein needs. You will also find various articles that will help you on your journey.\\n\\n\\uf0a9\\uf020 Eliminating any unhealthy temptations from your environment (work, home, car) and replacing with healthy\\n\\nalternatives.\\n\\n\\uf0a9\\uf020 Grocery shopping at least once per week to stock up on healthy choices and fresh fruits and veggies.\\n\\n\\uf0a9\\uf020 Maintaining a more active daily lifestyle. Move your body as much as you can in addition to your exercise\\n\\nprogram. The International Journal of Obesity released a statistic that reported we expend an average of 500- 800 fewer calories than we did a few decades ago because of our more sedentary lifestyle. At NW Women’s Fitness Club, we believe that all you have to do is start moving more in your life and then you won\\'t have to spend hours in the gym every week!\\n\\n\\uf0a9\\uf020 Getting enough sleep (7-8 hours per night). Sleep is when your body recovers and repairs.

These are not good odds! It\\'s now widely accepted that the problem has nothing to do with the person but rather with the process. You see, most people who want to start exercising just start. Imagine if you wanted to build a house. You\\'d start out with an architectural plan first to know exactly what you wanted your house to look like. Or what if you wanted to start a business? The banks would require a business plan first, right? They\\'d want to ensure that you\\'ve really thought it through carefully and you\\'ve got a good plan to enhance success. Well, these same guidelines apply to exercise. You\\'ve got to have a plan for success. This is why the first few months of your fitness experience are so important. This is when most people drop out. So at NW Women’s Fitness Club we focus on getting you past this stage to the point where you’re experiencing great results – and that alone, will help to motivate you to keep going. The problem is most people stop exercising before they even had the chance to see the changes to their body. We just won’t let that happen to you!\\n\\nAfter working with various clients for a number of years, we\\'ve noticed a number of characteristics that separate those who succeed with their fitness program from those who do not. Those who succeed buy into the \"Four Laws of Success\". You must be ready to accept these laws without exception.\\n\\nFirst Law – THE LAW OF POSSESSION. You need to understand that if you are going to achieve results, it is going to be up to you. The phrases \"If it’s going to be, it’s up to me\" or \"If I think I can or think I can\\'t, I\\'m right,\" ring very true. You have to take ultimate responsibility for success or failure. Sometimes clients believe their trainer is going to be the one who makes it happen for them. At Northwest Personal Training, we set them straight right away. All we can do is educate and guide. Our clients must be willing to make and stick to the changes. You cannot completely rely on someone else (like a personal trainer or workout partner) to make it happen for you and likewise, you cannot blame the kids or your partner for any failures.\\n\\nSecond Law – THE LAW OF EFFORT. Anything worth achieving is worth working for. Exercise and healthy eating takes discipline, will power, character, persistence, and a commitment to delayed gratification.\\n\\nThird Law – THE LAW OF CONSISTENCY. A month-long effort is not going to get you where you want. In order to achieve any goal, you must stick to your game plan for the long-term. Getting off track for a week is no big deal if you are consistent in your efforts, but if you are regularly tempted away from your program, you will not succeed. Consistency and persistency are the keys to manifesting any goal. Remember that if you want to be 10 pounds thinner 10 years from now, it is not what you do over the next eight weeks that matters. It is what you do over the next 10 years! All the changes we will suggest must be followed for the rest of your life - so of course, we are going to make room for indulgences. The program has got to be realistic if you\\'re going to stick to it. There are no short-term, quick fix solutions. Researchers have found only one characteristic common to those who succeed with exercise. All such people move toward their goal one step at a time. They are committed to constant, never- ending improvement. In practical terms, it means that regardless of anything else – busy work schedules, lack of energy, lack of time, feeling old, feeling lazy, hating exercise – they make no excuses! They keep exercising, taking their long-term goals and splitting them up into smaller goals. They take it one day at a time.\\n\\nFourth Law – THE LAW OF SELF-EFFICACY. If you are already questioning whether or not you can actually make the required changes, you are going to have a difficult time with your program. You must believe you can do it! Think of self-esteem as a bank. Each time you keep a promise to yourself, the store of self-esteem gets bigger, making it easier to keep the next promise to yourself. It\\'s all about \"Results Momentum\" - achieving one result gives you the confidence to achieve the next goal. Each time a promise is broken, however, your self-esteem goes down, making it easier to break the next promise. Reinforce this belief in yourself by surrounding yourself with others who are doing or have accomplished what you\\'re attempting. After all, if they can do it, so can you! We’ve got plenty of success stories at NW Women’s Fitness Club to inspire you to Reach for your Best!\\n\\n13\\n\\nReadiness\\n\\nWe supply the following questionnaires to new clients to help us determine where they are on the readiness scale. If you score low, this may not be the best time for you to initiate major changes to your lifestyle. It does not mean, however, that you cannot begin the process. You can still start the program and work on developing healthy patterns, but you should have lower expectations of yourself. If you score moderately, expect a few struggles on route towards your goals. If you score high, this is the perfect time for you to begin taking action towards your goals. Note: If you have been adhering to a consistent exercise and nutrition program for six or more months, you can skip this assignment.\\n\\nReadiness questionnaire I\\n\\nYes No\\n\\nDo you feel you are at some sort of health risk because of your current behaviors/\\n\\nlifestyle?\\n\\nDo you feel that making lifestyle changes will improve your quality of life and\\n\\ndecrease your risk of health-related disorders?\\n\\nDo you view your health and fitness program as a lifetime goal rather than a short-\\n\\nterm temporary goal?\\n\\nAre you willing to get personally involved in planning a health and fitness\\n\\nprogram?\\n\\nAre you willing to try different approaches?\\n\\nDo you have the patience to accept success in small increments and deal with\\n\\npossible setbacks?\\n\\nAre you willing to set realistic goals?\\n\\nAre you willing to make lifestyle changes?\\n\\nIf you answered yes to all these questions, you are ready for action! If you said no to one or more of the questions, you might experience resistance as you begin to initiate many of the actions required to achieve your goals. It may be helpful for you to review what is really important to you and learn more about the negative effects of your current behavior and the benefits of change.\\n\\nReadiness questionnaire II\\n\\n1\\n\\n2\\n\\n3\\n\\n4\\n\\n5\\n\\n1. Compared to previous attempts, how motivated are you this time to adhere to your exercise program? 2. How certain are you that you will stay committed to an exercise program for the time it will take to reach your goal? 3. Considering all outside factors in your life - work, stress, family obligations, etc. - to what extent can you tolerate the effort required to stick to a lifetime exercise and nutrition plan? 4. Think honestly about your goals. How realistic are they?\\n\\n5. How confident are you that you will be able to make changes to your current eating behaviors? 6. How confident are you that you can work regular exercise into your daily schedule starting tomorrow?\\n\\nNot at all motivated\\n\\nNot at all certain\\n\\nCannot tolerate\\n\\nVery unrealistic Not at all confident\\n\\nNot at all confident\\n\\nExtremely motivated\\n\\nExtremely certain\\n\\nCan toler- ate easily\\n\\nVery realistic Extremely confident\\n\\nExtremely confident\\n\\nScore: 6-12: Low motivation 13-25: Moderate motivation\\n\\n25+: High motivation\\n\\n14\\n\\nInternal Motivation\\n\\nIf you want to change something (your weight, your nutrition habits), you have got to change something! Makes sense, doesn\\'t it? But change is difficult. Most people attempt major changes in their life without setting up a framework for success. How can you get anywhere without a map or a game plan?\\n\\nFinding the motivation and inspiration to adhere to the changes in your life day-in, day-out, is challenging. Many people have very good intentions and start an exercise or healthy nutrition program, but within a few months 70 percent of them have dropped out. When people quit, it’s because they can’t find a reason to keep going. Motivation boils down to being sick and tired of the situation you’re in now and associating pleasure with the situation you will be in once you achieve your goal. If you can associate enough displeasure with your present scenario and enough excitement towards achieving your goals, you’ll pinpoint your personal motivation for exercise and healthy eating and find it much easier to stick with the program.\\n\\nNote: If you have been adhering to a consistent exercise and nutrition program for six or more months, you can skip this assignment.\\n\\nWrite down all the reasons you’re not satisfied with your present situation. Write down what will happen if you don’t make some changes to your lifestyle. For example, none of your clothes fit, you have no energy, your blood pressure has risen, you can’t sit comfortably in chairs, you feel embarrassed to wear a bathing suit, you keep gaining more and more weight every year, your cholesterol is getting out of control, you could actually die…\\n\\nWrite down all the reasons you want to achieve your goals. Write down how your life will be better. For example, you’ll be able to wear whatever you want, your energy will improve, your blood pressure will drop, you’ll feel comfortable in any environment, you’ll be more productive at work, you’ll feel more self-confident, you’ll lower your risk for developing heart disease, cancer, osteoporosis, you’ll have enough energy to go hiking, play with your kids/grandkids….\\n\\n15\\n\\nFitness Wish List\\n\\nIn the following space, write down all the fitness goals you would like to achieve. This is your personal fitness wish list. Write down anything you have ever thought of achieving with regards to your own individual health and fitness. Which goal, if you achieved it, would make this year unbelievable? Have you ever wanted to hike the Grand Canyon, complete a marathon or triathlon, cycle through Italy, learn to Scuba Dive or inline skate or rock-climb, cycle the Oregon coast, or would you just be happy with working out 4x/week consistently? What are you health and fitness wishes? The only rule with this wish list is that none of your goals can be related to your body size, shape or weight. Stay away from listing a goal such as losing 10 pounds or 4 inches off your hips. Let\\'s keep this list positive, action- oriented, and focused away from body image.\\n\\nMany people take this approach – ‘As soon as I get fit, then I’ll start doing the things I’ve always wanted to do.” We take the opposite approach. Let’s set the goal and in the process of training for the event or activity you’ve always wanted to do, then you will get in great shape! It puts purpose to your workouts. And it’s such a positive, motivating focus. For example, let’s say a client sets a goal of finishing a 10km fun run. Setting this kind of goal, because it has a deadline, provides a compelling reason to stick to the program and not miss workouts. In contrast, if the goal is to lose 10 pounds in 2 months, if the client gets off track, they can negotiate with themselves and say, “Well, I guess I can wait an additional week or two to achieve my goals.” But if they get off track with their training program while preparing for an event, they can’t call the event organizer and ask them to postpone the event because they aren’t going to be ready. A client knows that every workout or skipped workout will either positively or negatively affect their performance and their ability to achieve their goal. In addition, once he/she crosses the finish line, that’s something no one can ever take away from them. They will always have their medal, t-shirt, and photos crossing the finish line. Whereas, with weight loss, someone could lose the weight and then gain it all back next month and feel like a failure. Plus there is a lot of status associated with conquering a tough challenge or finishing a event, so a person’s self esteem receives a huge boost providing them with the belief that they can achieve the next goal. We have also found when someone succeeds at a goal such as this, they then inherently look towards the next goal – it’s just human nature. So they decide to attempt a half marathon, full marathon, a challenging hike, triathlon, etc. It’s a positive spiral. Whereas, with weight loss, it’s often a negative spiral. They lose the 10 pounds but they are still not happy. They then desire to lose another 5 pounds and get rid of this fat and so on. Some people who have the most ‘perfect’ bodies are those that struggle with their body image the most! For all these reasons, we try to keep the focus away from Body Image and instead focus on behaviors, events and actions.\\n\\n16\\n\\nSMART Goal Setting\\n\\nSetting realistic goals is the key to success. It is not enough to say, \"I want to get into shape\". Effective and realistic goals are Specific, Measurable, Attainable, Reward-based and have a Time frame. All your goals must be clear, easy to measure, and have a deadline. But don\\'t stop there. Successful goal setting requires two more things. Be prepared to reassess and reevaluate your goals on a regular basis and reward yourself once you have achieved a goal. For example, treat yourself to a massage, a new outfit or a trip. Then set your sights on the next goal.\\n\\nSometimes, when starting an exercise or nutrition program, we can get overzealous and decide to change a million things all at once. It soon becomes clear that you have taken on too much and it becomes almost impossible to succeed at anything. To avoid this, you need to determine what is most important to you and focus on these areas first.\\n\\nFinally, if you are undertaking a major lifestyle change, the big picture may be a bit overwhelming. Take the big goal and split it into small, easily achievable goals. This is realistic. It will help you succeed on a regular basis and that will give you the momentum you need to reach the ultimate goal.\\n\\nRecord your top one to two goals and break them down into smaller goals and action steps.\\n\\nSMART Goal #1 =\\n\\nAction Step #1\\n\\nAction Step #2\\n\\nAction Step #3\\n\\nAction Step #4\\n\\nAction Step #5\\n\\nSMART Goal #2 =\\n\\nAction Step #1\\n\\nAction Step #2\\n\\nAction Step #3\\n\\nAction Step #4\\n\\nAction Step #5\\n\\n17\\n\\nObstacles and Strategies\\n\\nWhat went wrong last time? You have most likely tried to stick to an exercise program before. Most people have. They try over and over again. Something like a New Year\\'s resolution, summer, a wedding or a reunion motivates them to try again. Eventually, they fail because they basically mimic exactly what they did last time. This represents the definition for insanity – doing the same thing over and over again but expecting a different result. Whatever forced you off track last time will more than likely surface again.\\n\\nThis time, things are going to be different. This time you are going to be prepared. We are going to develop a strategy for overcoming roadblocks posed by work, kids, fatigue, or lack of time. We are going to determine how you are going to balance it all.\\n\\nOutline any obstacles that have surfaced in the past or that you expect will surface in the future. Once you have outlined the potential obstacles, then you can determine your strategies for overcoming them. You will be prepared - no surprises! Plus, we here to help you get past those obstacles!\\n\\nNote: If you have been adhering to a consistent exercise and nutrition program for six or more months, you can skip this assignment (unless you need to strategize for any upcoming obstacles).\\n\\nObstacle\\n\\nStrategy (you may find it necessary to outline numerous strategies for any potential obstacle)\\n\\n1.\\n\\n2.\\n\\n3.\\n\\n4.\\n\\n5.\\n\\n6.\\n\\n18\\n\\nMissing a Workout is much more than just Missing a Workout\\n\\nConsider how much discipline it takes to workout three to five days a week. Think about how hard it is to keep stretching beyond our comfort zones and how challenging it is to exercise at high intensities. Consider the self-resolve required to eat healthy foods and drink lots of water every day when temptations surround us everywhere we go. But if you have the courage to respect your body – the temple that houses your mind and spirit – personal mastery will not be far away. It says a lot about who you are as a person when you invest the time to take care of yourself. It says you respect and love yourself enough to do the things necessary for you to be at your personal best. Each time you get into the gym for a workout on a day when you just don’t feel like exercising, you grow a little stronger as a human being. Each time you go for a run or walk on a cold winter’s day when you just feel like staying under the warm, cozy covers, you strengthen your character. When you endure a tough workout, it enables you to persevere through any other challenge in your life. Working on improving your physical conditioning will not only enrich your life and make you a better person, you’ll also become a better parent, a better spouse, a better and more productive worker, and a better friend.\\n\\nExercising regularly, eating well and taking the time to relax and nourish your body will make you feel happier. It will provide you with more energy than you have ever known. It will give you greater stamina and mental toughness and make you a clearer, stronger thinker. It will make you more patient and loving. There are 168 hours in a week. Surely each and every one of us, regardless of our hectic schedules, can carve out three to five of them to care for our bodies and work on mastering our physical state.\\n\\nYou must remember that a missed workout is much more than just a missed workout! When you miss a workout, you don’t just stay at the same level you were at – you actually take a few steps back. Every time you miss a workout, you have done something to strengthen the habit of not working out. When you’ve made the promise to yourself to exercise so many times per week and then you break that promise, you start to lose trust in yourself. With each missed workout, you start to lose self-confidence and begin to question whether you can actually stick with it at all. A missed workout fuels self-doubt and makes that negative habit stronger. Miss enough workouts, and eventually that negative habit of not working out will replace the positive habit of exercising that you have worked so hard to cultivate. Every time you fail to do the right thing, you fuel the habit of doing the wrong thing. So the next time you’re trying to justify pressing the snooze button and skipping your workout, or working through lunch instead of taking a walk break or heading right home after work instead of stopping at the gym, just don’t do it. Don’t even think about it. Don’t even allow yourself the opportunity to talk yourself out of doing what you know you need to do to be at your best. Just remember that you’ll feel like a million bucks once you’re done. The real challenge for most people is not the workout itself, but actually overcoming the negative thoughts that try to sabotage very good intentions.\\n\\n“The greatest irony of our physical life is that when we are young, we are willing to sacrifice every bit of our health for wealth, and when we grow old, we are willing to sacrifice so much of our wealth for just one day of health.” Don’t let this happen to you. The little things in life are actually the big things and the quality of success that you will experience in your life ultimately depends upon the tiny choices you make every minute of every hour of every day. It’s the small daily acts and habits that define how big we end up living.\\n\\nLooking Good, Feeling Great & Living Life to the Fullest!\\n\\nAdapted from Robin Sharma’s ‘Family Wisdom’ plus a little bit of our own wisdom.\\n\\n19\\n\\nOvercoming Excuses\\n\\nStarting and sticking to an exercise or nutrition program takes a lot of discipline. Here are the most common stumbling blocks to exercise and healthy eating that you may experience and healthy ways to overcome them. Sometimes, even when we have good intensions and want to do the right thing, it can slip us up if we have the wrong attitude about it. Do you see yourself in any of the following scenarios?\\n\\nNote: If you have been adhering to a consistent exercise and nutrition program for six or more months, feel free to skip to the next section.\\n\\nI don\\'t have enough time. If you have trouble finding time to exercise, you are not alone. A perceived lack of time is one of the most common excuses for not starting or for quitting an exercise program. But it really does not wash. We have clients who manage large businesses, clients with 6-8 children and clients who seem to do it all. How do they do it? They make health and fitness a priority in their life. When life gets rough, exercise is usually the first thing to go when, in fact, it should be the last. Exercise is the glue to mental sanity when life becomes chaotic.\\n\\nSomehow, when others need you, your needs tend to end up on the back burner. Someone at work asks you to complete a project, your spouse needs your attention, the kids need some quality time, your friends are asking you why you have not called, and you have a to-do list that extends well into the next 6 months. You can see how easy it is to convince yourself that the morning workout can wait until lunch and then until after dinner. Or maybe tomorrow and finally, \"I\\'ll get back on track next month!\" Commitments, responsibilities and the demands of work, family, and social life are always going to be there. When you allow yourself to put your own needs second to everything and everyone else, you will end up the loser.\\n\\nResearch, in fact, shows that people who exercise are more productive at whatever they are doing. Translation: You will be able to do more when you are in good shape. As for believing exercise is a huge time commitment, even 10-30 minutes a day, if done consistently, can result in health benefits.\\n\\nMake an appointment with yourself, just as you would for your doctor or dentist or a meeting with your boss. That way, when someone asks if you can meet at 5 o\\'clock, you can honestly say, \"Sorry, I\\'ve got an appointment. How about at 4:00?\" Scheduling fitness into your life is why personal trainers have become so popular. Now you are accountable to your trainer as well as yourself.\\n\\nStop putting it off! \"I\\'ll start exercising right after New Year\\'s…in the spring…right after I\\'m finished with this huge project…once the kids get older…once the kids leave home…after I\\'ve retired…Now is the time to start because there will always be things competing for your time. You can choose to make exercise a priority in your life now or wait until you\\'re forced to make it a priority. People who cannot find the time to exercise are often forced to find the time for illness. We take our health for granted until we get sick. People who swear they do not have a minute to exercise, then find themselves hospitalized for bypass surgery and out of commission for weeks, soon recognize that the extra time taken to exercise would haven been well worth it! The message is clear. Unless you take care of yourself now, one day you may find yourself unable to take care of your business, family, or any of your other interests.\\n\\nAnother helpful strategy for overcoming the time obstacle is to sit down and record how you spend your time in a typical day. Then go through the list and identify any time wasters. It could be the television or computer or perhaps there are constant interruptions at work. Now determine how you could eliminate some of these time wasters. For example, at work, make it known that from 10:00 until noon you are not to be interrupted so you can focus on some important projects. You will find that you do have time to exercise – you just need to restructure your schedule to make sure you have time for the\\n\\n20\\n\\nI have no energy: Those who exercise regularly know from experience that exercise actually leaves you with more energy! Some helpful strategies for overcoming this obstacle are to schedule exercise when you are less likely to feel exhausted from a long day at work or with the kids. Get up 45 minutes earlier than everyone else and go for a walk. It will start your day off on a positive note. Keep your fitness gear in the car so that on the way home you can stop at the gym for your workout. If you go home first, the couch and TV may be too tempting after a long day at work. Or if you do find yourself skipping out on your workouts because you\\'ve got no energy, schedule in with a trainer or a friend. Whether you are tired or not, you still have to be there because they are waiting for you.\\n\\nI\\'m too old to start exercising: No, you are too old not to exercise! A 30 year-old sedentary individual will suffer from a 10 percent decrease in muscle mass and aerobic capacity and a reduction in flexibility each decade. Bone density deterioration starts at age 35. By the time you are 68, you will have experienced an 80 percent decrease in strength. By age 80, an individual will have lost half of their muscle mass. The good news is that if you exercise, these statistics will improve dramatically. Even people as old as 90 have experienced the positive benefits of exercise, so it is never too late to get started. It doesn\\'t have to be intense, but you do need to start doing something!\\n\\nI hate exercise: In the beginning, exercise may feel like a chore, but eventually it will become a physical and mental health need. It is important to find activities you enjoy doing so that you will participate in them regularly, see the results, and get hooked. Use music, try hiking or walking, and add variety to your program to make it more fun. Exercise with friends. Studies show you tend to achieve better results that way because it will become more difficult to skip workouts. There is also no evidence to suggest that exercise needs to be painful. If it hurts that much, you may be doing too much, too soon. While exercising, you may feel some discomfort, muscular fatigue, or a burning sensation near the end of a set or an exercise bout. These feelings are normal. However, while performing an exercise, you should not feel sharp pain. This is not normal and you should stop the exercise immediately and consult a sports physician or physiotherapist. All of us have experienced muscle soreness after a new activity or highly intense workout. Remember the feeling after your first day of skiing, first aerobics class, or the first run of the summer? This sensation is referred to as delayed onset muscle soreness because it usually takes one to three days after the workout for the stiffness to surface. Many participants rate the effectiveness of a workout by how sore they are afterwards, but it you are training appropriately, there is no need to be that sore. It is okay to think \"Hey, my muscles feel like they had a great workout yesterday.\" However, if you have a problem getting out of a chair, walking, or even just moving, you are training too hard - and not very sensibly. To reduce the likelihood of extreme muscle soreness from training sessions, always warm up, cool down, stretch, and progress slowly. Once you have established a consistent exercise routine, there are no extra health benefits from pushing yourself to be extremely sore. Remember – pain is a warning signal that your body has done too much too soon. When you experience extreme muscle soreness or pain, back off on the intensity of your program and progress more slowly. \"No pain, no gain\" is a myth. Pain is not necessary to improve your fitness and get results.\\n\\nI\\'m too out of shape to exercise: One survey found the top reason why people choose not to join a gym is because they want to get into better shape or lose weight first. This backwards approach may never get you to your goals! At NW Women’s Fitness Club, we have worked hard to create an environment that is friendly, non-intimidating and comfortable. We’ll get you through these initial awkward feelings.\\n\\nThe gym scene is not my thing: Sorry, this will not wash. There are literally hundreds of things you can do at home to get in shape. We can come to your house and design a customized program for you.\\n\\n21\\n\\nMy knees hurt so I can\\'t exercise: The health benefits of exercise often outweigh the risks. Certain conditions may make exercise more difficult but you can work around most problems. We will work with your physician, physical therapist or health practitioner to design a program to strengthen your weaknesses. Plus, if you do have knee problems, there is no reason why you can\\'t work on your upper body and abdominals while you rehabilitate your knees.\\n\\nI can\\'t see any results: One of the biggest hurdles new exercisers face is that the effort often does not match the result. They have been exercising religiously for five weeks and jump up on the scale. Ugh, no change! They feel the program must not be working and give up. Unrealistic expectations can be a real downer. Avoid measuring your success just by the scale. Instead measure the improvement to your energy levels, monitor how many more reps you can do of a particular exercise or keep track of how many more minutes you can do of a given activity. You may be making more progress than you think.\\n\\nAll or Nothing: You are scheduled for a 90 minute workout but something comes up and you cannot get to the gym for the allocated time. You scrap the workout and decide you will try to fit it in tomorrow. You have decided to eat healthier but one day you slip a bit at lunch and have a chocolate bar. You decide that since you have already failed for the day, you might as well throw in the towel and indulge in a few cookies, a bowl of ice cream, and a bag of chips. Tomorrow is another day. Can you see how this \"all or nothing\" approach works against you? Wouldn\\'t a 30 minute workout have been better than no exercise as all? Wouldn\\'t a single chocolate bar have been better than an all-out binge? Sometimes, striving for perfection is what leads to failure. The trick in trying to stick to a long-term plan is to learn to compromise. When it comes to nutrition, for example, focus on the 80/20 rule – 80 percent of the time you eat really well and 20 percent of the time you indulge a little. No going overboard, though. When it comes to exercise, remember that any activity is better than nothing.\\n\\nLet\\'s Go Back Home: Imagine this scenario. You have scheduled a two-week vacation and have decided to drive to your favorite holiday destination. You get half way there, get a flat tire and turn around and go back home. Sounds ridiculous, doesn\\'t it? But this is exactly what happens when most people start exercise or nutrition programs. They are on their way to their goals and they slip up. Instead of \"fixing the flat\" and continuing on toward their goal, they give up and return to old habits and patterns. We know that 70 percent of people who start an exercise program drop out within a matter of months, and most people who lose 10 pounds gain them back. So how do you avoid these set-backs? It is important to accept that there are going to be obstacles, challenges or perceived failures along the way to any goal. No one is perfect! Those who succeed learn from the challenge and get right back on track.\\n\\nThe Here and Now: So many of us fall prey to the lure of immediate gratification. The chocolate cake staring us in the face is too great a temptation compared to future weight loss. We would rather experience the pleasure now and worry about the consequences later. A binge today simply means tomorrow we will eat better or we will work out twice as long or hard. There is always a way to justify a lack of discipline. Discipline and will-power are perceived as deprivation - we are sacrificing or losing something. But if you can imagine that each time you work out, stick to a nutritional plan or decide not to indulge in a less-healthy choice, you are actually giving yourself something – spiritually, emotionally, and physically. Sticking to an exercise or nutrition plan is the same as practicing discipline when your kids are misbehaving. As parents, they would like to scream, shout and lose it but instead we count to 10 and choose our words more carefully. There is no doubt that practicing this type of discipline makes you feel better about yourself. It is the same with exercise. Your body deserves to be treated well. You deserve to eat well and exercise regularly. Many athletes think of their body as a temple and so should you. Think of that the next time you notice yourself grabbing for a piece of cake a little too often. Push it away and think of it as actually giving something to yourself rather than taking something away.\\n\\n22\\n\\nSECTION THREE\\n\\nCARDIOVASCULAR EXERCISE\\n\\n“High on the wall,\\n\\nin the castle of your dreams of success,\\n\\nhangs the picture of what you want to be.\\n\\nAlways keep that picture hanging there.\\n\\nSee yourself where you intend to be.\\n\\nNight and day dream of what you intend to do\\n\\nand what you intend to be,\\n\\nfor your dreams interpret your intentions always.\\n\\nAll successes are, at first, dreams.”\\n\\n23\\n\\n24\\n\\nBenefits of Cardiovascular Exercise:\\n\\n\\uf020 \\uf0b7\\uf020 \\uf0b7\\uf020 Burns fat and calories directly Improves body composition \\uf0b7\\uf020 Increases bone density \\uf0b7\\uf020 \\uf0b7\\uf020 Reduces risk for coronary artery disease \\uf0b7\\uf020 Enhances sleep quality Improves posture \\uf0b7\\uf020 Improves functional ability \\uf0b7\\uf020 \\uf0b7\\uf020 Enhances self-esteem \\uf0b7\\uf020 Reduces episodes of depression\\n\\nIncreases aerobic capacity Improves energy levels and provides a natural high\\n\\nHere are some definitions that you should be aware of:\\n\\nCardiovascular Exercise: This refers to exercise that conditions your heart and respiratory systems. It typically includes Aerobic and Anaerobic exercise.\\n\\nAerobic exercise is exercise that demands a level of oxygen intake that your body is able to supply (for extended periods). It involves activities such as going out for a walk, jog, cycle, swim, or taking a fitness class. It is exercise that is within your comfort zone and at an intensity that you could hold for 20 minutes plus. This type of exercise will condition your heart and achieve the benefits listed above.\\n\\nAnaerobic exercise is exercise that demands a level of oxygen intake that your body is unable to adequately supply (for extended periods). It is a more challenging form of exercise. It involves the same activities as above but at a much harder intensity. For example, it would involve going for a jog and then for 30 seconds picking up the pace and sprinting. Then you would return back to an easier intensity at the end of the 30 second sprint. You could do this at regular intervals during a running, cycling, swimming, or walking workout. This kind of workout will help you get fit fast. It raises what is called your \"anaerobic threshold\". This threshold point is the feeling you\\'ll experience during an activity session when you\\'re pushing hard, perhaps a bit too hard, and you start to breathe really heavy and your heart is pounding fast and if you maintain this intensity for too long, you might start to feel nauseous and dizzy. This is one of the side effects of lactic acid - a toxic by-product of high intensity exercise. When you perform anaerobic intervals as listed above, you only hold this pace for 30 seconds to two minutes, and just before you\\'re about to start experiencing some of those nasty side effects of high intensity exercise, you drop the pace again and allow your body to recover. By doing these brief, high- intensity intervals your body starts to get used to the intensity and is better able to handle the lactic acid, flush it out of the tissues and actually use the lactic acid for energy. So by doing these anaerobic intervals, you will get fit fast and you\\'ll start to notice that intensities that used to get you huffing and puffing aren\\'t that challenging anymore. This form of interval conditioning will also expend more calories per minute and help you achieve any fat loss goals you may have.\\n\\nJust a note - Wait a few months before graduating to high-intensity exercise if you are a beginner. Of course, the faster you walk, step, dance, cycle, or run, the more calories you use per minute. However, if you have been sedentary, high-intensity exercise compromises the ability to sustain exercise for a long time. For that reason, lower-intensity exercise is more effective in the initial stages of training and is a prerequisite to higher calorie burning, higher intensity exercise. In fact, you will experience great results by just getting started on a program. You do not want to start your program by dreading each exercise session because you know it is going to hurt --that will make it difficult to stay motivated.\\n\\n25\\n\\nThree easy walks a week on an ongoing basis is far better than one hard run every once in a while. Remember, consistency is the key to getting results. You are going to eventually want to intensify your program, but you want to progress to this level slowly. In the beginning, start by just incorporating two months of easy training with a slow, gradual progression of volume. Do not worry about intensity – just work on increasing the amount of time you spend exercising.\\n\\nVariable impact refers to exposing your body to a bit of impact here and there, and is important because in order to maintain muscle mass and bone density, you need to add a little bit of stress onto the bone. You may have heard many people complain that high-impact exercise really bothers their joints, specifically back, knees, or feet. For a lot of people, high-impact activity may not be the activity of choice; however, in your program you will want to ensure that you do expose your muscles and bones to a bit of impact. For example, if you\\'re a swimmer, your body weight is supported by the water, so you\\'ll want to complement this with an activity like walking. Swimming is a great activity, but recent studies have shown that it is not as beneficial for bone density as medium-impact (walking) or high-impact activities (volleyball). Even though swimming is better than no exercise, it should be augmented with strength training or a type of activity that will provide a bit more impact i.e.. walking, fitness classes, etc. Or if you\\'d like to try jogging, stick to a walk/run program where you may start with walking for four minutes and running for only one minute at a time. This will be sufficient to provide the positive results we\\'re looking for.\\n\\nCardiovascular Prescription:\\n\\nThe Surgeon General’s Report released in 1996 suggests that 30 minutes of light activity every day (equivalent to household chores, walking, gardening, cycling) will be sufficient to improve someone\\'s health. This is a non-structured way of attempting to improve your health. All you have to do is commit to being more active in your life. Just try to get in 30 minutes of activity every day.\\n\\nIf your goals are more aggressive and you really desire to improve your overall fitness, your prescription will require a higher level of volume and intensity. Here are some guidelines:\\n\\nThe American College of Sports Medicine (ACSM) recommends 3-5 days/week of 20-60 minutes of cardiovascular activity to maximize fitness. They recommend 5-7 days/week to maximize fat loss. We are also big fans of doing something active everyday. That way you don’t have to ask yourself if you should exercise today. It is assumed that you will do something active everyday – it becomes part of your everyday lifestyle. Instead of asking ‘if’, you’ll ask ‘what’. We’re not suggesting that you workout hard everyday, but just do something active --even if it’s going for a short, easy walk on your lunch or after dinner.\\n\\nIf your goal is fat loss, it is suggested that each aerobic session should expend at least 300 calories minimum (of course, anything is better than nothing). Your own personal heart rate monitor will help you measure calories burned during each workout, but to give you an idea, 300 calories would be equivalent to approximately 32 minutes of stepping or a high intensity fitness class, three miles of running, or 4-5 miles of walking.\\n\\nThe actual type of aerobic activity must be continuous in nature and involve your large muscle groups. Some of the best choices are as follows:\\n\\nWalking Rowing\\n\\nRunning Racquet\\n\\nCycling Stairclimbing Fitness Classes X-Country skiing\\n\\nSwimming\\n\\nInline Skating Hiking\\n\\n26\\n\\nChoosing an Aerobic Activity:\\n\\nThe most important consideration when deciding which activity will be your primary activity of choice is deciding which of the above activities interest you the most and that you really believe you could do on an ongoing basis. The best activity in the world is the one you actually do regularly. If we told you that running was the best way to get in shape but you hated running, you probably would not stick to the program very well and would probably experience very limited results. So, you really need to examine your interests. For example, if you prefer to exercise outside, running through trails or hiking may be your answer. If you prefer indoors, you might enjoy the energy of fitness classes or working out on a stairclimber so you can be distracted by a magazine or TV. If you like to exercise in groups, fitness classes or a walking clinic may help you stick to your program. If you are a solo exerciser, your own individualized program may offer the solitude you are looking for. It is important to determine the perfect- fit, custom-designed program that will facilitate your efforts. Here are some questions to help you design a program that is going to work for you.\\n\\nHow many days per week can your schedule accommodate exercise? _______ How much time do you want to commit during each exercise session? _______ Which days are best to exercise? Which days are best to rest? Do you like to exercise in the morning, at lunch, after work or evening? _______ Do you like to exercise alone, with a friend, in a group or a combination? ______\\n\\nM T W TH F S Sun M T W TH F S Sun\\n\\nConsideration: When determining when you will exercise, consider that working out first thing in the morning definitely has advantages. One theory is that an early morning workout will jump-start your metabolism and get you revving at a higher level all day long. In addition (and probably more importantly), many people find if they workout first thing and get it out of the way, there are fewer chances for life responsibilities to distract them away from their exercise ambitions. And finally, an early morning workout sets the tone for the entire day. You already have one success under your belt and thus, may find it easier to make healthier choices at lunch or pass on the donut break mid-afternoon. However, keep in mind that exercise at any time of the day is best. For example, many working moms prefer to exercise on their lunch- breaks so they can get home after work and be with their kids. So if you have tried early morning exercise and it did not work for you, don\\'t worry. You will accomplish your goals regardless of the time of day you exercise.\\n\\nWhen deciding whether an activity is the right one for you ask yourself some of the following questions: \\uf0b7\\uf020 Do I find the activity pleasurable? Do I like it? Is it a lot of fun? Does it make me happy? \\uf0b7\\uf020 Am I interested in the activity? Is it stimulating? \\uf0b7\\uf020 Do I get absorbed in the activity? \\uf0b7\\uf020 Do I feel energized during or after the activity? Is it invigorating? Is it refreshing? \\uf0b7\\uf020 Does the activity give me a sense of accomplishment? Is it gratifying?\\n\\nIf you answered yes to all these questions, you\\'ve made a good choice. If you\\'ve answered no to these questions and you find the activity unpleasant, boring, frustrating, and you hate every second of it, you should reconsider your choice and search for an activity that will provide you with more enjoyment.\\n\\nRemember that consistency is the primary key to achieving your exercise goals. Find an activity you enjoy and you will be more motivated to participate, stick with it more consistently and reap the benefits more quickly! Find which activity sparks your interest and soon you will also enjoy a fit and healthier body!\\n\\n27\\n\\nFine-tuning Tips:\\n\\nBefore we move on, let’s examine the following considerations. We know that in order to maximize caloric expenditure, we need to maximize the amount of oxygen we are consuming. We utilize more oxygen when we involve more muscle mass. So any activities that involve more muscle mass will make burning calories and body fat easier. So if your goal is to maximize fat loss, consider these points: \\uf0b7\\uf020 At least one or two of your primary aerobic activities should involve activities during which you stand to perform them like running, power walking, fitness classes, cross-country skiing or stair-climbing. If your muscles have to support you in an upright position, they must expend more energy to do so in comparison to a seated, body-weight supported position.\\n\\n\\uf020 At least one of your primary aerobic activities should involve both your arms and your legs. Activities like rowing or cross-country skiing, which involve vigorous activity from both your arms and your legs, will expend a lot of energy. Of course, cross country skiing which occurs in an upright position and involves both your arms and your legs will be a higher calorie burner than rowing.\\n\\n\\uf020 Consider the environment in which you exercise. Your heat regulator and your appetite are both\\n\\ncontrolled by your hypothalmus. So, if you are exercising in a colder environment, like a pool during a swim workout, your hypothalmus must act in order to maintain your core temperature. As it responds to the colder environment, it also acts to stimulate your appetite. This explains why many athletes find they may start a run hungry but once they are finished, it may take them an hour or more before they are ready to eat. In contrast, many athletes have difficulty explaining why, after a swim workout or a long- easy hike, they are famished. This effect makes it more difficult to lose fat with swimming. This is why elite level swimmers still carry on average 5% more body fat than elite level runners. We are definitely not suggesting that you find the hottest environment to perform your workouts – which would pose its own health risks. We are also not suggesting that swimming does not burn fat – it is just not as efficient as, say, running. Swimming has many advantages for overweight individuals; their bodies do not overheat, so the workout feels more comfortable; the buoyancy factor makes it a lot easier on the joints; and they can definitely improve their cardiovascular and musculo-skeletal systems. Just be sure that not all your primary workouts consist of activities like swimming, outdoor cycling and easy hiking which all take place in a colder environment. Instead include at least one activity during which you will sweat and raise your body core temperature.\\n\\nDesigning Your Weekly Cardiovascular Program:\\n\\nYour Personal Trainer will help customize your cardiovascular training program. Here are the principles and rationale we will use when designing your weekly structure.\\n\\n1. Structure 1-2 short and intense interval workouts into your program each week. These workouts should last for approximately 20 minutes and should involve a Rating of Perceived Exertion (RPE) intensity of approximately 8 (we’ll discuss RPE at the end of this section). During these workouts you will notice that your breathing is heavier and you will definitely be able to feel your heart beating more quickly. These workouts will definitely be above your comfort zone or where you would prefer to exercise.\\n\\n2. Structure 1-2 moderate length and intensity aerobic workouts each week. These sessions should\\n\\ninvolve a 30-40 minute duration and an RPE effort level of 6-7. This is the intensity zone where most people will train so this will feel comfortable. Most people neglect training in the extreme zones - the very easy and the very challenging.\\n\\n3. Structure 2-3 long and easy intensity workouts each week. These sessions should be 45 minutes plus in duration and involve an RPE intensity of 5. These workouts will feel very comfortable. You may even feel like you are going too slow – you are not! Workouts in this zone are not very stressful on your system but will effectively target your aerobic energy system and help to develop fat burning enzymes. This intensity zone is also recommended if you are just getting started into exercise. The other zones may be too stressful and uncomfortable for you at this point.\\n\\n28\\n\\n4. Include a 6-12 minute low intensity warm-up and cool-down. The body does not respond very well\\n\\ngoing from inactivity to very intense activity. The cardio-vascular, musculo-skeletal, neurological and metabolic energy pathways need to be gradually stimulated in order to perform at an optimal level. Muscles that are warm have a much better ability to extract and utilize oxygen to produce energy. As muscles warm up, the enzyme activity level is increased. This means that fats and sugars are broken down more rapidly, and more energy and less lactic acid (the burning sensation) will be produced. This will of course, enhance your performance and increase your ability to burn fat! Your body also does not respond very well going from intense activity to complete rest. Your heart, lungs, muscles, joints, and energy systems require a gradual cool-down to avoid blood pooling in the lower extremities, dizziness and to assist in the recovery process. Warming up and cooling down is a healthy way to exercise anyways but in addition, it is a way to prolong your caloric burn for each workout. So, for example, if you are going to go for a run, start and finish with a 6 minute walk. A warm-up and cool-down should generally involve the same workout activity but at a much lower intensity.\\n\\n5. Working out indoors? Use a variety of machines. If you are using indoor cardiovascular machines, try staying on the same machine for a maximum of 15 minutes. This will create better muscle balance. We would rather see someone spend 10 minutes on the stairmaster, rowing machine, treadmill and ski- machine than spend 40 minutes just on the stairmaster. If you are using the same machine or activity all the time, the muscles targeted with this exercise will continue to get fitter but the other neglected muscles will get weaker and muscle imbalances are sure to surface. This method of training will develop a more overall toned physique and reduce your risk for injury. And finally, mixing up your indoor machines will also help to prevent boredom. If you\\'re working out at home and only have one indoor machine, perhaps mix up your program. For example, you could start by walking on the treadmill for 15 minutes. Then get off the machine for a few minutes and skip or step up and down onto a step. Then get back onto the treadmill to finish off your workout.\\n\\n6. Structure at least 1-2 recovery days into your weekly exercise program. Remember this, muscle tissue does not grow stronger during exercise. In fact, muscle breaks down during exercise! It needs a period of recovery to repair, grow, develop and get stronger. Back-to-back hard workouts means that the muscles never get a chance to fully recover. Incorporating one to two recovery days into your workout week will ensure your body gets a chance to heal. Do not think, though, that you need to stay home, chained to your couch and TV! When we say recovery, we mean, that maybe you go for an easy stroll or hike or cycle but you are not concerned about getting into your training zone. Just relax and enjoy moving your body at a nice, easy pace.\\n\\nLow intensity versus high intensity:\\n\\nA number of years ago, you may remember many fitness professionals prescribing lower intensity activity to maximize fat loss. Many fit people lowered the intensity of their workouts fearful that they were not burning fat. Unfortunately, they were misled and many people still believe that low intensity activity is the best way to maximize fat loss. The reality is that the activity that expends the most amount of calories will lead to the most amount of fat burned.\\n\\nYes, during lower intensity activity you will burn a higher percentage of fat and during higher intensity activity you will burn a higher percentage of carbohydrates or sugars. But the important point to note is that during low intensity activity you are burning fat at a higher percentage of a lower amount of calories. When you exercise at a lower intensity you are definitely expending less calories. The selective use of fat as a fuel, specifically at lower intensities, does not translate into greater fat loss, regardless of how tempting it is to draw this conclusion. The more important focus with regard to calories expended, is not the percentage of energy coming from fat, but rather the total volume of fat used and the total number of calories expended. Let’s look at the math.\\n\\n29\\n\\nAt 60% max heart rate (easier intensity) \\uf0b7\\uf020 Approximately 50% of calories come from fat (50% from sugars) \\uf0b7\\uf020 Approximately 8 kcal/min are expended \\uf0b7\\uf020 60 minutes x 8 kcal/min = 480 total calories \\uf0b7\\uf020 50% x 480 kcal = 240 fat calories\\n\\nAt 80% max heart rate (more vigorous intensity) \\uf0b7\\uf020 Approximately 40% of calories come from fat (60% from sugars) \\uf0b7\\uf020 Approximately 11 kcal/min are expended \\uf0b7\\uf020 60 minutes x 11 kcal/min = 640 total calories \\uf0b7\\uf020 40% x 640 kcal = 264 fat calories\\n\\nFrom these figures you can see how fitness leaders could have been misled. If you were to examine only the first line, the percentage of fat being burned as fuel, you would definitely prescribe lower intensity activity. However, if you examine the whole picture, it is clear that higher intensity activity definitely expends more calories and also more fat. Here is some more statistics to convince you.\\n\\nIt takes approximately 3,500 calories to burn one pound of fat. Compare the following exercise programs.\\n\\nProgram A – Easier intensity (approximately 5kcal/min) – For example, easy walking \\uf0b7\\uf020 30 minutes of activity 3x/week \\uf0b7\\uf020 150kcal/session x 3x/week \\uf0b7\\uf020 450kcal/week \\uf0b7\\uf020\\n\\nIt would take 8 weeks to burn 1 pound of fat\\n\\nProgram B – Same intensity as above but for a longer duration \\uf0b7\\uf020 60 minutes of activity 3x/week \\uf0b7\\uf020 300kcal/session x 3x/week \\uf0b7\\uf020 900 kcal expended per week \\uf0b7\\uf020\\n\\nIt would take 4 weeks to burn 1 pound of fat\\n\\nProgram C – More vigorous intensity (approximately 10 kcal/min) – For example, jogging or power walking up and down hills \\uf0b7\\uf020 60 minutes of activity 3x/week \\uf0b7\\uf020 600kcal/session x 3x/week \\uf0b7\\uf020 1800 kcal expended per week \\uf0b7\\uf020\\n\\nIt would take 2 weeks to burn 1 pound of fat\\n\\nIf you followed Program A, it would take you eight weeks to burn one pound of fat! Most people would give up by then. If you could easily handle the higher intensity of Program C, wouldn\\'t you prefer to just wait 2 weeks to burn off that pound of fat deposited around your waist, hips or thighs? Remember though, if you can\\'t handle the higher intensity of Program C, follow Program B which means you can maintain the easier intensity but you just have to go longer.\\n\\nTime is definitely an issue for a lot of exercisers and most don\\'t want to spend hours in the gym if they can get the same results in a shorter period of time. Consider this. At 60% of your max heart rate, it would take you approximately 40 minutes to burn off 300 kcal. If you could handle a higher intensity and were able to exercise at 80% of your max heart rate, it would only take you approximately 27 minutes to burn the same 300 kcal. If time is a factor and you do not have a lot of time to waste, would you rather exercise for 40 or 27 minutes and still burn the same amount of calories?\\n\\n30\\n\\nIf we have not convinced you yet, consider this. Did you know that the highest percentage of fat that you burn during any activity is during rest! At rest, you are using approximately 50% fat as your fuel – that is the highest % of fat you can burn – you are never burning 100% fat. That\\'s right, just sitting here reading this manual, you are burning the highest percentage of fat you could possibly burn. That is because your body can only store a limited supply of carbohydrates (sugars) and so during rest, the demand on your body is low and your body wants to spare your precious sugar stores. Since you have an unlimited supply of fat stores, your body would rather burn fat during rest.\\n\\nBut remember that although you are burning a higher percentage of fat at rest, you are expending very few calories (approximately 1kcal/min) so overall you are not burning a lot of fat. If type of fuel utilized was the critical factor for fat loss, then we would be prescribing more rest because this is when we burn the highest percentage of fat as fuel. But it is a higher percentage of a lower number of calories. So, of course, we know it is ridiculous to even consider rest or sleep as a high fat burning activity.\\n\\nOne last note. Examine elite level athletes like sprinters. The majority of their training sessions involve high intensity, sugar-burning activity. But have you ever seen a fat sprinter? Of course not. Although, they are burning a lot of carbohydrates or sugars during their training sessions, they are also expending a lot of calories and a lot of fat. In fact, some sprinters eat over 5000-6000kcal/day without gaining any fat!\\n\\nThe benefits of higher intensity exercise are as follows:\\n\\n\\uf020 Expends more calories per minute \\uf0b7\\uf020 More efficient – burns more calories in less time \\uf0b7\\uf020 Most effective method for improving fitness conditioning \\uf0b7\\uf020 Most effective method for raising anaerobic threshold. Your anaerobic threshold is the stage of exercise where you feel very tired and feel the need to either stop or slow down. You may feel dizzy or nauseas if you stay at this level too long. By incorporating higher intensity activity into your exercise workouts, you raise your anaerobic threshold. This means that you can exercise at a higher intensity before you start to experience those uncomfortable sensations.\\n\\n\\uf020 Most effective method for inducing training adaptations. Incorporating this type of training into your program will enable your body to handle the higher intensities more easily. You will find that intensities that used to leave you breathless and fatigued, no longer challenge you anymore. Soon, you will be able to expend more calories per minute compared to when you first started exercise. When people first initiate an exercise program, a comfortable calorie burning level is approximately 5cal/min. Elite athletes can expend more than 20cal/min and sustain it for over 2 hours! As a result, it takes them a lot less time to burn one pound of fat.\\n\\n\\uf020 Most effective method for increasing fat mobilization. This means that as you get fitter, you actually get better at burning fat. Inside of your fat cells, you have enzymes called hormone sensitive lipase and lipoprotein lipase. Hormone sensitive lipase, the \"good guys\", are responsible for releasing fat from a fall cell to be used for energy. Lipoprotein lipase, the \"bad guys\", are responsible for the uptake of fat from the blood stream into fat cells to be stored. Lipoprotein lipase functions to develop our unwanted bulges. If you have lived a sedentary lifestyle and have eaten a poor diet all your life, you will have a lot of the \"bad guys\" and they will be very good at their job. You will have fewer \"good guys\" and they will not be so competent with their responsibilities. The goal is to get more good guys doing their job. But changing the internal chemistry inside of your fat cells may take years. So in the beginning you may not be experiencing results as quickly as you want because you body is actually working against you. But with consistency in your training program, your body will soon start to work for you. Soon you will have increased your ability to mobilize and use fat as a fuel. Training in a high intensity zone will make you fit quick and enable you to enjoy this wonderful training benefit. Soon you will be burning more fat during and after exercise. You will become a fat burning machine!\\n\\n31\\n\\n\\uf020 Experience a higher EPOC (excess post oxygen consumption). Have you ever wondered why you continue to breathe heavy and sweat after your workout is done? Why doesn\\'t your breathing and body temperature go back to normal immediately? After exercise you consume a greater amount of oxygen to assist your body in recovering from the stress of the workout and the demands it placed on your body. It is important to know that EPOC uses fat as its fuel. At higher intensities, your EPOC is greater translating into a greater caloric and fat expenditure post activity. Although the effects of EPOC are small, if you expended an additional 100 calories post exercise as a result of a high intensity exercise session, within 100 workouts (5 months), you would have burned an extra 10,000 calories or 3 pounds of fat! Intervals are the best way to add intensity to a workout by adding brief, high-energy outputs followed by active recovery phases which will avoid fatigue and injury.\\n\\n\\uf020\\n\\nSo, the bottom line is that everyone can benefit for incorporating high intensity training into their program once they have completed the initial level of base conditioning. As we have mentioned, the recommended fitness prescription is one that includes all intensity training zones. That is, sometimes you go easy and long and other times you go hard and fast. This will ensure you train all of your energy systems and minimize overtraining. As a reminder, don’t start with high intensity exercise. Complete a couple months of easier, base conditioning first. And not all of your workouts should be at a high intensity. Mixing it up is the best prescription.\\n\\nBased on all your answers and your understanding of the material in the above section, you can develop a weekly exercise program. Keep in mind, your personal trainer will help you customize this plan and ensure it’s effective and efficient.\\n\\nDesign your own personalized exercise program.\\n\\nPersonal Exercise Program\\n\\nMon\\n\\nTues\\n\\nWed\\n\\nThurs\\n\\nFri\\n\\nSat\\n\\nSun\\n\\nActivity\\n\\nDo not worry about \"making mistakes\" in your program. Just getting you to exercise regularly is all we need to do at this point. We can fine-tune your program as you go along and as we introduce you to some important concepts. But for now, just remember that the best program in the world is the one you do regularly. So just get moving and never stop!\\n\\nReview your program. Does it look realistic? Most people who start an exercise program are initially very excited, motivated and ready to commit to anything! Unfortunately, this may not last long if the goals they have set are unrealistic. So if you believe you can follow this plan, then you can!\\n\\n32\\n\\nMeasuring Intensity\\n\\nMany exercisers question whether they are working too hard or should be breaking more of a sweat. How do you know if you are exercising in the right intensity zones? That is where monitoring your heart rate comes in. Traditionally an intensity of 70 percent of your maximum heart rate was thought to be the ideal. But this one-size-fits-all approach might not provide the best results for everyone. We are finding that a more custom-designed approach is more effective. Here is how to go about it:\\n\\nFirst, you have to determine which of the following zones fits your goals: general health, weight management, aerobic conditioning, advanced conditioning or a combination of all four.\\n\\nZone 1: General Health – A great deal of research indicates that being active at 50 to 60 percent of your maximum heart rate [RPE 4-5], consistently and for a total of 30 minutes on most days, reduces the risk of developing many chronic diseases. Low intensity activities like walking, gardening, household chores or easy cycling will achieve this. If someone does not need to lose body fat and they are not training for a sporting event, this may be all they need to do to stay healthy.\\n\\nZone 2: Weight management – If your goal is to reduce body fat and you have been relatively inactive, you will need to train at a level of 60 to 70 percent of your maximum heart rate [RPE 6]. This is still within your comfort zone and allows you to exercise at a steady pace for a long enough time to burn off a substantial number of calories.\\n\\nZone 3: Aerobic Conditioning/Weight Management – If your goal is to improve your cardio-vascular conditioning for better stamina and endurance, you should train within a zone of 70-80 percent of your maximum heart rate [RPE 7]. This is also a good zone for fat burning if you are already fairly fit. This zone represents a more vigorous level of activity.\\n\\nZone 4/5: Advanced Conditioning – If you are in top shape and training for a sporting event like a 10km race, a triathlon or tennis, you might need to include some workouts that are 80 percent and above your maximum heart rate [RPE 8-9]. This level of training is both physically and mentally demanding so it is not something you would do on a daily basis. And it is not for everyone. Only the really fit should consider working in the range. This zone is also a fat burning zone if you are extremely fit.\\n\\nRemember that ideally, your exercise program will include workouts in each of these ranges – short and hard to long and easy.\\n\\nHere is a formula to help you figure it all out.\\n\\nStep One: Estimate Maximum Heart Rate: This is the maximum number of times your heart can beat in a minute. You can determine your true maximum heart rate in a science lab or you can estimate this figure using this formula.\\n\\nMale: 220 – age = Female: 226 – age =\\n\\nStep Two: Determine Resting Heart Rate: This is your heart rate in beats per minute when you are resting. It is typically your lowest average heart rate. If you take the time to determine your true resting heart rate, your training will be more on target. To determine your true resting heart rate, before you get up in the morning, measure your heart rate for one minute. Be sure to wait a few minutes after the alarm has gone off, so your heart will recover from being startled. Do this 3 days in a row and take the average. This is your resting heart rate.\\n\\n33\\n\\nDetermine your true resting heart rate.\\n\\nDay one:____________ beats per minute Day two:____________ beats per minute Day three:___________ beats per minute\\n\\nAverage resting heart rate = ____________ beats per minutes\\n\\nStep Three: Calculate your Heart Rate Reserve. This is the difference between your maximum heart rate and your resting heart rate - it is the number of beats per minute between your highest and lowest heart rate (MHR—RHR = HRR)\\n\\nComplete this chart and then use the figures to calculate your Heart Rate Training Zones.\\n\\nEstimated Maximum Heart Rate (MHR)\\n\\nTrue Maximum Heart Rate (MHR) This would be calculated in a lab. If you do not have this figure, use the estimated MHR to the left.\\n\\nResting Heart Rate (RHR)\\n\\nHeart Rate Reserve (HRR) MHR - RHR\\n\\nMale: 220 – age = Female: 226 – age =\\n\\nHEART RATE TRAINING ZONES\\n\\nZone 1 - General Health: 50-60% percent of your MHR\\n\\nLower Target Heart Rate Zone = [HRR X 50%] + RHR =\\n\\nUpper Target Heart Rate Zone = [HRR X 60 %] + RHR =\\n\\nZone 2 - Weight Management: 60-70% of your MHR.\\n\\nLower Target Heart Rate Zone = [HRR X 60%] + RHR =\\n\\nUpper Target Heart Rate Zone = [HRR X 70 %] + RHR =\\n\\nZone 3 - Aerobic Conditioning/Weight Management: 70-80% of your MHR.\\n\\nLower Target Heart Rate Zone = [HRR X 70%] + RHR =\\n\\nUpper Target Heart Rate Zone = [HRR X 80 %] + RHR =\\n\\nZone 4 - Advanced Conditioning: 80-90% of your MHR.\\n\\nLower Target Heart Rate Zone = [HRR X 80%] + RHR =\\n\\nUpper Target Heart Rate Zone = [HRR X 90 %] + RHR =\\n\\n34\\n\\nZone 5 - Elite Level Training: 90-100% of your MHR\\n\\nLower Target Heart Rate Zone = [HRR X 90%] + RHR =\\n\\nUpper Target Heart Rate Zone = [HRR X 100 %] + RHR =\\n\\nNote the above age-adjusted maximum heart rate formula is perfect for our purposes. A more accurate method is to actually determine your maximum heart rate in a laboratory setting using a stress test facilitated by a physician or sports physiologist. The tests are generally administered on a treadmill or exercise bicycle and cost anywhere between $100-$300. Assuming you don\\'t want to spend the money on a maximal heart rate test, just use the estimated value above.\\n\\nHere’s complete a sample. Let\\'s say you are a 40 year old inactive woman who wants to lose body fat. Let\\'s say we\\'ve determined that your resting heart rate in the morning is 70 beats per minute. And let’s say you will be working predominantly in Zone 2.\\n\\nEstimated maximum heart rate = 226 - age (40) = 186bpm Heart Rate Reserve: 186 - 70 = 116bpm Low end of training zone = (HRR x 60%) + 70bpm = 140 beats per minute High end of training zone = (HRR x 70%) + 70bpm = 151 beats per minutes\\n\\nThe training zone for this type of workout would be 140-151 BPM.\\n\\nPurchasing a Heart Rate Monitor:\\n\\nOnce you have determined your optimal training zones for each workout, the best way to ensure that you are in the correct zone is to invest in a heart rate monitor. This will allow for an accurate, quick analysis of your heart rate and the ability to easily intensify or reduce the intensity of your workout if you are not in the right zone. Unfortunately, manual heart rate monitoring (on your wrist or neck) has been found to be inaccurate with errors as high as 27 beats per minute. In addition, when testing on your neck or wrist, you have to stop and interrupt your workout to do the reading.\\n\\nWe encourage all clients to make the investment in a Heart Rate Monitor. You can purchase a good brand and model for less than $150. A heart rate monitor will allow you to program in your training zones and will beep if you are going too easy or too hard. It will also calculate your caloric expenditure so if you have a goal, you’ll know when to stop. Basically, it’s like having your trainer with you for all your workouts. We carry the Polar brand which is currently the best heart rate monitor brand with EKG accuracy and we’ll program it for you and teach you how to use it.\\n\\nRating of Perceived Exertion (RPE) Your heart rate can be affected by numerous variables such as food, medication, temperature, and stress so it is necessary to monitor the intensity of your workouts with an additional indicator – Rating of Perceived Exertion (RPE) scale. It is a scale that calls on your own perception of the intensity of a workout to indicate whether you are training in the appropriate zone. RPE is gaining popularity because of its effectiveness, simplicity, and safety. The RPE scale was developed by Dr. Gunnar Borg from Sweden. Borg noticed a close relationship between exercising heart rate (which is directly related to the intensity of the exercise) and how the athlete actually perceives his or her effort. The original BORG method used a scale from 6-20 however, has since been modified to the RPE scale using a more user-friendly scale from 0-10. Zero on the scale represents a resting level with no elevation in breathing. At the other extreme, a rating of 10 would indicate all-out severe exhaustion. Here is how to match up the numbers with your workouts.\\n\\n35\\n\\nRPE Scale\\n\\n0 – Represents a resting level with no elevation in your breathing.\\n\\n1 – Represents a more active rest, like working at your desk with no elevation in your breathing.\\n\\n2 – Represents an active resting level like getting dressed or walking around in your house with no elevation in your breathing.\\n\\n3 – Represents a low level of activity like gardening or the warm-up stages in a workout. You may be aware of your breathing but it is slow and natural.\\n\\n4 – Represents a low level of activity like a stroll or an easy bike ride with a slight elevation in breathing. You are still well within your comfort zone. This would be your predominant training zone if you fall within the General Health Training zone.\\n\\n5 – Represents a moderate level of activity like walking briskly. Your breathing is elevated higher than in level 4 but you are still well within your comfort zone. This would be your predominate training zone if you fall within the Weight Management Training zone or if you were scheduled for a long, easy workout.\\n\\n6 – Represents a moderate level of activity like walking briskly to a very late appointment. Your breathing is faster and deeper but you are still at a level that is within your comfort zone. You feel that you can comfortably hold a conversation. This will still be your Weight Management Training zone or your moderate intensity workout zone.\\n\\n7 – Represents a vigorous level of activity like jogging. Your breathing is more rapid and deep and you feel like you can hold a conversation but would probably prefer not to. This intensity is beginning to feel more challenging and outside of your comfort zone. This would be your predominate training zone if you fall within the Aerobic Conditioning/Weight Management zone or are performing a moderate intensity workout.\\n\\n8 – Represents a vigorous level of activity like faster running. You can hold a conversation but it would be short. You think you can continue for the remainder of your session, but you are not 100% confident that you can make it. You feel that you are outside of your comfort zone and being heavily challenged. This will still be your Aerobic Conditioning/Weight Management Training zone.\\n\\n9 – Represents a very, very vigorous level of activity like sprinting intervals in a run. Your breathing is very labored and you could not hold a conversation. You would definitely feel fatigued and outside of your comfort zone. This would be your predominate training zone if you fall within the Advanced Conditioning zone or were performing a short, hard workout.\\n\\n10 – Represents an all-out effort with severe exhaustion. It is not recommended that you train at this level.\\n\\nSummary:\\n\\nIt\\'s important to realize that you do not need to implement all of our suggestions into your program today. You may start by just committing to exercising three times per week. Then once you have made that a habit then you could perhaps, start mixing up the intensity zones by incorporating one easy, moderate and hard workout in each week. Then a few months later, you could try and incorporate a different type of activity. This is a work in progress. Enjoy the journey.\\n\\n36\\n\\nSECTION FOUR\\n\\nRESISTANCE TRAINING\\n\\n“If we did everything\\n\\nwe were capable of doing\\n\\nwe would literally astound ourselves.”\\n\\nThomas Edison\\n\\n37\\n\\n38\\n\\nBenefits of Resistance Training\\n\\nMost of us know that exercise is important but we tend to equate it with aerobic activity, like jogging, walking, swimming or cycling. Often, we forget that resistance training offers just as many health benefits as aerobic exercise. You can expect to experience the following benefits after initiating a resistance training program:\\n\\nIncreased muscle tone and definition \\uf0b7\\uf020 Increased muscular strength and endurance \\uf0b7\\uf020 Increased metabolic rate \\uf0b7\\uf020 Increased fat loss \\uf0b7\\uf020 Improved posture \\uf0b7\\uf020 Increased bone density \\uf0b7\\uf020 \\uf0b7\\uf020 Reduced risk for injury \\uf0b7\\uf020 Reduced risk for falling \\uf0b7\\uf020 \\uf0b7\\uf020 \\uf0b7\\uf020\\n\\nIncreased functional capacity Improved coordination and movement Increased athletic performance\\n\\nMore muscle = Less fat\\n\\nYour energy output during the day includes the energy expended as a result of your body functioning to sustain life (basal metabolic rate), food thermogenesis (the energy expended in response to food intake) and daily physical activity and exercise. The above items contribute to daily energy output by 70%, 20% and 10% respectively. So if you can even slightly affect your basal metabolic rate, you may significantly affect the daily calories expended. Remember that the average sized person burns 1kcal/min at rest. If the resting metabolic rate can be increased by just 10%, this equates to a rate of 1.1kcals/min. Doesn\\'t sound like a big deal, does it? But over an hour, this equates to an extra 6 calories and over a day, an extra 144 calories. Remember, that to burn a pound of fat you need to expend 3,500 calories more than you eat. This means that it would take 24 days (3500/144) to burn 1 pound of extra fat – and this does not include any calories expended from exercise. This amounts to about 15 pounds of fat which could be lost in one year by merely raising the metabolic rate by 10%. The question is - how do you raise your metabolic rate?\\n\\nAs we get older, our metabolism, the amount of calories we burn at rest, drops. This is related to a decline in the activity of our liver, kidneys, and other organs as we get older. This declining rate is almost entirely out of our control – almost! Examine the following chart which breaks down our metabolism.\\n\\n39\\n\\nBasal metabolic rate\\n\\nBrain\\n\\nOrgan metabolic rate (kcal/kg/day) 260\\n\\nOrgan weight\\n\\n1.4\\n\\nOrgan metabolic rate (kcal/day) 365\\n\\n% of basal energy expenditure 21%\\n\\nHeart\\n\\n600\\n\\n.3\\n\\n180\\n\\n20%\\n\\nKidney\\n\\n400\\n\\n.3\\n\\n120\\n\\n7%\\n\\nLiver\\n\\n359\\n\\n1.6\\n\\n560\\n\\n32%\\n\\nLung\\n\\n200\\n\\n.8\\n\\n160\\n\\n9%\\n\\nMuscle\\n\\n40% of total body weight\\n\\n24%\\n\\nYou can see that although your liver activity makes up the highest percentage of metabolic activity, there is really nothing you can do about that. It is in our best interest to keep our metabolism revving but we can\\'t decide \"All right, I need to increase my metabolic rate so I am going to get my liver in shape.” But in contrast, we can do something about our muscle activity which contributes 24 percent to our metabolic rate. Muscle comprises approximately 40% of our body weight. If you can get your muscles working at a higher level, the difference to your metabolic rate will be significant. By developing your muscular system, you will increase your metabolism. Muscle is an energy burning tissue and thus, the more of it you have on your body, the more fat you will burn both during exercise and during rest. How would you like to be sitting in front of the TV knowing you are burning more fat than you were before you started resistance training? In fact, one pound of muscle tissue expends an additional 30-40kcal/day. That does not sound like a lot but imagine that after an 8-12 week resistance training program, you can expect to develop 3-4 pounds of lean, muscle tissue. That equates to an extra 90-160 calories being burned per day. Add this up over 365days/year and we are talking about 10-14 pounds per year of fat either lost or not gained compared to not having that muscle mass. So if your goal is to lose body fat or maintain an ideal body fat percentage and lean physique, that should be enough motivation to get you into the weight room.\\n\\nWe also know that on average, we will lose 3-5 percent of muscle mass per decade after the age of 25. In fact, the average sedentary 80 year old man will have lost approximately 50% of his muscle mass. As a result, our fat mass will increase. If you want to reduce the magnitude of this age-related fat gain, start resistance training and depositing muscle on your body.\\n\\nThe difference of having more muscle on our body is even more significant during exercise. The difference in energy expended by a resting or working muscle is quite severe. When you start exercising, your muscles demand that your organs and tissues kick into action at a real high rate. So if you have more muscle demanding more energy, your caloric expenditure will sky-rocket! One study compared the energy costs of treadmill walking between obese and lean, highly muscular men who were the same weight and height. The results showed that the energy expenditure was significantly higher at any given speed and grade of walking for the body builders compared to the obese males. Expenditure reached up to 100 calories higher for the muscular men at a moderate walking pace up an incline. These results demonstrate that just by having more muscle on your body, you will burn more energy both during exercise and rest.\\n\\nResistance Training Guidelines:\\n\\nHere are some definitions that may help to clarify this component of your program:\\n\\nRepetition: refers to the number of times you perform an exercise without stopping.\\n\\nSet: refers to the number of times you perform a complete series of repetitions. For example, you may\\n\\n40\\n\\nperform 2 sets of 10 reps.\\n\\nThe American College of Sports Medicine recommends one set of 8-12 (10-15 if you are 50 years or older) repetitions for each major muscle group 2x/week to improve overall muscle conditioning. This recommendation is also sufficient to maximize fat loss. The repetition zone between 8-12 is the favored prescription because it will cause improvements in both muscular strength and endurance. And can you believe all you have to do is one set!\\n\\nHowever, if you are a more advanced exerciser or looking to increase the size of your muscles, it may be necessary for you to increase your volume of training and include multiple sets and exercises for each muscle area. But just because you are an advanced exerciser, doesn’t mean you have to do multiple sets of any exercise. You can achieve a high intensity, advanced workout using only one set of a variety of exercises. Years ago, trainers were taught to prescribe 3 sets of 10 reps for every exercise regardless of the person or the goal. Well, things have changed since then. Recently one-set training has received a lot of attention. One-set training is just that: one set of 8-12 reps of each exercise. The trick is that each set must be performed to momentary muscle fatigue (we’ll talk about that in just a bit).\\n\\nMany studies are now finding that one-set training can yield the same results as two to three sets. That\\'s very exciting news for the busy exerciser who can\\'t commit to spending hours in the gym. One-set training can dramatically cut down the time you need to spend in the weight room, giving you more time for other activities including cardio and stretching. Clients often have an easier time committing to their weight training program when they know they only need to be in the weight room for 40 minutes instead of an hour and a half. Because of this consistency, they experience great results!\\n\\nOne-set training also allows for more variety. Many personal trainers would rather have their clients perform nine different exercises working the muscles in a variety of different planes and angles instead of only 3 sets of three exercises. For example, instead of doing 3 sets of chest press, do one set of chest press, one set of chest flies and one set of push-ups.\\n\\nNow, keep this in mind. If you\\'ve been doing two or more sets of various exercises, it\\'s not that you\\'ve been training incorrectly. In fact, multiple set training has been used for years with great results. But now a new technique has surfaced. Research is demonstrating that intensity and not number of sets is the critical factor in weight training. So by sequencing your exercises correctly and ensuring you hit momentary muscle fatigue with each set, you\\'ll be able to achieve very similar benefits in less time. You can try it for a change in your program.\\n\\nMany exercisers, wanting to lose body fat and understanding that muscle is critical to maximize fat loss, have made muscle conditioning a priority. However, by spending extra time in the weight room they have sacrificed very critical cardiovascular exercise time. It is important to remember that you burn calories and fat directly during aerobic exercise and this component of your program should be your priority. Muscle conditioning is a must but you can’t neglect your cardiovascular training.\\n\\nFoundational Resistance Training Principles:\\n\\n\\uf020 Quality and execution of movement is critical. It makes no sense to perform 20 sloppy reps. It is far\\n\\nbetter to perform 8 reps with perfect form and then take a break. Proper execution of each rep is the most critical factor in weight training. Reps performed with poor technique will cause slower progress and may put you at risk for injury.\\n\\n\\uf020 Take it slow. Proper resistance training is not a fast sport. In fact Wayne Westcott, a leading Strength\\n\\nand Conditioning researcher, has determined that one repetition should take approximately 5-6 seconds;\\n\\n41\\n\\nthat is 2 seconds to lift the weight and 4 seconds to slowly lower the weight in a controlled fashion. Most people lift much too quickly using momentum instead of muscle. A proper set of 8-12 repetitions should take approximately 1 minute to complete. As you advance in your program, your trainer may incorporate speed and power training but it is typically done without heavy resistance and with tools that are more conducive to faster movements (medicine balls, body weight only training, exercise tubing etc).\\n\\n\\uf020 Breathe. A proper breathing rhythm will make each set more effective. Focus on exhaling as you lift\\n\\nthe weight or when you exert and inhale as you recover or lower the weight.\\n\\n\\uf020 Sit up straight. Proper posture is critical to ensure you are working the correct muscle groups and not putting your body at risk for injury. Always keep your abdominals contracted throughout the entire set of any exercise. Pull them up and in towards your spine to help stabilize your trunk. Keep your shoulders back and chest lifted up and out on any seated, bent over or standing exercise.\\n\\n\\uf020 A good exercise set will finish once you hit momentary muscle fatigue. This is the point during which you absolutely cannot do another rep with perfect form. If you can perform more reps, you should either perform the extra reps to hit momentary muscle fatigue or next time, increase the resistance so you can hit momentary muscle fatigue within the suggested repetition zone of 8-12 reps.\\n\\n\\uf020 Never go to failure. Failure is when you continue the set with poor technique or when other muscle groups have kicked in to help finish the set. It is important that you always avoid poor technique and muscle substitution.\\n\\n\\uf020\\n\\nIf you cannot perform 8 reps, the weight is typically too heavy. If you can perform 12 reps with perfect technique, increase the weight by 5%.\\n\\n\\uf020 Perform your muscle-conditioning sessions on alternating days. You may be surprised to learn that you don’t get stronger when you weight train. You actually get stronger during the rest periods in between your workouts. At a cellular level, when you weight train, your muscles experience microscopic minor tears. The body responds to this effect by sending blood and nutrients to the muscles to help them heal. And that’s exactly what they do. They respond by getting stronger. So it’s important never to work the same body part two days in a row. For example, if you can commit to 5 workouts a week, you may complete your cardio workouts on Monday, Wednesday and Saturdays and your full body muscle conditioning workouts on Tuesdays and Thursdays. Or if you can only commit to three workouts a week, you may do your cardio AND muscle conditioning on Mondays, Wednesdays and Fridays. Or if you are doing a split routine, you could do cardio and work out your lower body on Monday and Thursdays and your cardio and upper body on Tuesdays and Fridays.\\n\\n\\uf020 Put your mind into it. It is okay to disassociate while performing some fitness activities. For example, you can jump onto a treadmill and plug in a 7 minute mile pace and whether you think about it or not, you will expend the same amount of calories. However, this is not the case with muscle conditioning exercise. You must focus on what you\\'re doing because there is such a strong connection between the brain, the nerves and the muscles. We know that if you actually concentrate on what you are doing, you can significantly increase the amount of muscle activity measured during these exercises. So put down your magazines and really focus on each set. Each repetition and each set will become much more effective and you will experience results more quickly.\\n\\nWhich exercises will do the trick?\\n\\nThere are literally thousands of different exercises you could perform to get the results you are looking for. We don’t expect you to be the experts on program design. That’s our job. But here’s some of the principles that we adhere to you when customizing your program. At least you’ll know there is a method to our madness.\\n\\n42\\n\\nProgressions: At NW Women’s Fitness Club, we progress clients through three stages of movement. Once they demonstrate that they can perform the movements in Stage 1 with excellent execution and no pain, they can then graduate to the next stage. The stages are as follows: Learning Phase, Progressive Phase and Elite Phases. Here’s a summary of what to expect at each stage of progression.\\n\\nSTAGE 1 Learning & Conditioning Phase Teach technique, posture & alignment, slow speed of movement, muscle sensation & activation, breathing and core stabilization. Focus on consistency.\\n\\nSTAGE 2 Progressive Phase Begin to add more dynamic movements, slightly faster movements, more load and movements that require greater balance.\\n\\nSTAGE 3 Elite Phase Begin to add more impact, more skilled movements, more integrated movements, more speed and more intense movements.\\n\\nStart with basic exercises. It is necessary to progress from exercises that require the least amount of skill, coordination, balance, and overall fitness to exercises that maximally challenge these skills. This means that in the beginning, very basic exercises will do the trick. As you improve and master the technique of these exercises, then you should advance the program by incorporating more challenging exercises. It is important that you do not attempt a more challenging exercise without having first developed the basic foundation for the skill.\\n\\nHere are some types of movements that will be included in your program:\\n\\n\\uf020 Compound movements - movements that involve many joints and muscle groups within one\\n\\nexercise. For the lower body, exercises like Lunges, Step-ups and Squats are compound movements. For the upper body, exercises like Chin ups, Rows, Bench Press and Push-ups are compound movements. These types of movements are important because they train the body in a fashion that is similar to how we actually move in every day life. For example, every time you get out of a chair - that\\'s a squat. Every time you bend down to pick something up - that\\'s a lunge. However, you are going to want to progress into lunges and squats in a gradual fashion. In the beginning, start with just mini-bends into squats and lunges and progress into the deeper lunges and squats once you learn proper knee tracking and alignment and your muscles get strong enough to handle the deeper load. Many traditional exercises in the weight room are uni-jointed and involve only one muscle area. However, this is not really how our body moves. Most of the movements we perform everyday are compound. If we want to get stronger and be able to use this strength in our everyday lives, we have to train the muscles in a way that will allow those benefits to carry over to real-life movements.\\n\\n\\uf020\\n\\nIntegrated/Combination Training - These types of exercises are definitely compound in nature and involve combining 2 or more exercises into one, complex, fully-integrated, functional movement. For example, a squat with an overhead shoulder press would be a form of integrated training. A bicep curl while standing on a wobble board would be a form of combination training. The theory behind Combination Training is as follows - most movements that we perform every day involve the upper body having to work together with the lower body while we have to balance our body and stabilize our torso. However, many traditional exercises in the weight room are very isolated. So when someone is placed in an environment where the body has to use various muscle groups, the muscles don\\'t know how to respond correctly and effectively because they\\'ve never been trained to do this. It would be similar to a football coach taking each of his or her players and training them independently of each other. Although the coach could feasibly get each of the players into the best physical shapes of their life, if that team doesn\\'t get together and scrimmage, the first game will be a disaster. Our muscles work in a similar fashion. That is, each muscle can be strong independently of the others, however, if they haven\\'t learned how to react, oppose and resist each other, the strength in the weight\\n\\n43\\n\\nroom will not carry over as well into the real world. There are many cases of people who are very strong in the weight room - that is, they can lift a lot of weight. But they go home and lift some furniture or carry some heavy boxes and hurt their back and strain some connective tissue because they haven\\'t taught the muscles to work together. The message is this - you need to be strong in and out of the weight room. Combination Training movements will help you achieve this goal.\\n\\nThe IDEAL NWWFC Full Body Training Session\\n\\nKeep in mind this is an ideal template we recommend for most clients. Your trainer may adjust this program template based on your goals. For example, they may split your muscle conditioning sessions into lower body training days and upper body training days. They may sequence your exercises to focus on areas that are important to you. Again, since there a literally hundreds of different exercises to target all the components listed below, a trainer will help ensure you’re addressing all the important areas.\\n\\n\\uf020 First 5-10 minutes of workout – general ROM warm-up and physical prep for session – Medicine Ball\\n\\nChoppers/Tubing Rotations/Pulls/Presses\\n\\n\\uf020 3-6 Full Body Integrated Movements/Cardio/Metabolic/Agility Drills \\uf0b7\\uf020 1-4 Compound Lower Body Movements (Squats, Lunges, Step Ups, Deadlifts, 1 Leg Dips) \\uf0b7\\uf020 2-4 Compound/Isolated Pulling Movements (Chin-ups, Rows, Pulldowns, Reverse Flies) \\uf0b7\\uf020 1-3 Compound Pressing Movements (Pushups, Chest Press, Overhead Shoulder Press) \\uf0b7\\uf020 1 Bicep Exercise \\uf0b7\\uf020 2 Tricep Exercises (varied shoulder starting positions) \\uf0b7\\uf020 1-2 Bridging Exercises \\uf0b7\\uf020 1-2 Hip Stabilizer Exercises (Resisted Side Steps, Adduction, Side Lying Exercises) \\uf0b7\\uf020 1-2 Middle/Lower Trapezius/ External Rotator Exercises \\uf0b7\\uf020 2-3 Spinal Stabilization Exercises \\uf0b7\\uf020 1 Spinal Flexion Exercise \\uf0b7\\uf020 1 Lateral Spinal Flexion Exercise \\uf0b7\\uf020 1 Spinal Rotation Exercise \\uf0b7\\uf020 1-2 Spinal Extension Exercise \\uf0b7\\uf020 Total 20-30 Exercises \\uf0b7\\uf020 Last 5-10 minutes of session spent on cooldown/stretching/muscle release\\n\\nChange your program regularly. The only perfect resistance program is one that changes. A program that we design today, may be perfect today, but in about 4-8 weeks, it will no longer be perfect and not as effective. This is due to the Overload Principle - a training principle that all Personal Trainers must adhere to in order to help their clients experience ongoing results. When you first begin exercising, the body is exposed to a stimulus that it\\'s not used to and it will be forced to respond in a positive fashion by getting stronger and fitter. This is called a physical adaptation, which means that your body has structurally, biomechanically, and physiologically improved. But simultaneous with the physical adaptation is the physical plateau that many people experience. In order to experience ongoing results, the body must be stressed or stimulated to a greater degree than what it is used to. We know that the body needs to be\\n\\n44\\n\\nchallenged in order to progress. This overload principle can be adhered to by changing your program in a variety of different ways.\\n\\nFor example, you could:\\n\\n\\uf020 \\uf0b7\\uf020 \\uf0b7\\uf020 \\uf0b7\\uf020 Change/Advance the exercises \\uf0b7\\uf020 Adjust the order/sequence of exercises\\n\\nIncrease the resistance you lift Increase the number of sets Increase the number of days you strength train from 2 to 3 days per week\\n\\n\\uf06f\\uf020\\n\\nIt\\'s best to mix up the sequence of your routine during your weekly regime. For example, if you always do your cardio exercise first, next workout do a brief warm-up, then do your muscle conditioning exercises and then finish with your cardio. Then next workout, do your cardio first and muscle conditioning last. And on another day, alternate back and forth between muscle and cardio. It will be a completely different workout and a new stimulus for your muscles and your heart. With that said, if your primary goal is muscle conditioning and developing muscle tone/bulk, you may want to do your muscle conditioning first when you have the most energy and strength so you can really focus on this area.\\n\\n\\uf06f\\uf020 This same principle applies to lower body and upper body conditioning. For example, if you always do your legs first, then mix it up and next workout, do your upper body first and your lower body second. Or combine lower body and upper body movements into an integrated exercise. But again, if upper body is your focus, do this first when your energy levels are highest.\\n\\n\\uf020 Adjust the amount of recovery time you take between exercises. \\uf0b7\\uf020 Utilize a different resistance training technique. For example, superset training, pyramid training,\\n\\nsuper-slow training, split training, post-exhaust training, circuit training etc.\\n\\n\\uf06f\\uf020 When deciding which technique to use, remember there is no perfect training program. One\\n\\nstudy comparing nine different training routines found no statistically significant difference in the strength increase produced by any of them. So the message is clear - a multitude of training techniques will achieve results. Just be sure you change what you’re doing regularly.\\n\\nThis is where an investment in a personal trainer will save you a lot of time. Some of our clients see their trainer multiple times during the week. But even just one or two sessions every few months, in order to make the changes required for you to see continued results, will go a long way in maximizing your workout time. IDEA, the International Health and Fitness Association, released a statistic recently at one of their International conferences. It stated that only 25 percent of people working out in a gym are getting the results they want. But out of the 25 percent of people getting results, 90 percent of them are working with a personal trainer. So, it is quite clear that having a personal coach oversee your program, monitor your progress and make regular updates is an investment in your health worth making!\\n\\nOne last word for our Female Clients:\\n\\nMany of you may be concerned about putting on too much muscle. We realize that most of you do not want to gain a lot of muscle and do not want to look like the women on the cover of Muscle and Fitness. Well, we want to assure you that you do not need to be concerned with gaining this amount of muscle. Women typically do not have the natural levels of growth hormone and testosterone to develop muscles in this manner. These women are a very, very small percentage of our population and most of them workout for hours in the gym and are most likely using some form of supplementation or ergogenic aid to help them achieve this type of muscle build. Honestly, following the muscle endurance and strength guidelines in this manual is not at all about getting bulky - it is all about keeping the muscle you\\'ve got!\\n\\nStretch it out:\\n\\n45\\n\\n46\\n\\nSECTION FIVE\\n\\nNUTRITION\\n\\n“It is not the mountain that we conquer\\n\\nbut ourselves.”\\n\\nSir Edmund Hillary\\n\\n47\\n\\n48\\n\\nNutrition Principles\\n\\nMost people approach nutrition and dieting with unbelievable will power and determination. But unfortunately, will power will only last so long then biology and physiology takes over. Here’s an analogy – Try holding your breath under water for as long as you can. No matter how much you want to stay underwater, eventually biology kicks in and you have to come up for air. The same holds true with dieting. If you’re eating in a manner that stimulates your appetite, eventually, you are going to give in to the cravings regardless of how bad you don’t want to. So by understanding and adhering to the following nutrition tips you will approach nutrition and fat loss in a more educated fashion. You are going to outsmart your system!\\n\\nDo you remember this physics principle? Energy cannot be created nor destroyed; only transformed from one form to another. So energy coming into our bodies through food or drink must be transformed into another form of energy – either the energy to produce movement or stored energy (body fat) for later use.\\n\\nConsider the following Weight Loss/Gain/Maintenance Equation:\\n\\nWeight Lost: Calories In < Calories Out Weight Gained: Calories In > Calories Out Weight Maintained: Calories In = Calories Out\\n\\nYou can’t change this equation. But it’s important to understand all the variables that control each part of the equation.\\n\\nWhat Controls Calories In?\\n\\n\\uf020 Eating and Drinking provides you with calories in. You’ve probably heard that a calorie is a calorie.\\n\\nAnd although this is true, some calories that you consume can actually stimulate your appetite causing you to eat more. Or some foods are so dense in calories but provide such little volume that when you eat them, even though you’ve consumed a great deal of calories, you’re still hungry. And some food make you tired and less likely to want to move your body and less able to perform at your best. If your goal is fat loss or weight management, the best foods to eat are nutrient-rich foods that are lower in calories, fill you up and suppress your appetite. If your goal is to improve your energy levels and perform at your best, the best foods to eat are also nutrient-rich foods.\\n\\nWhat Controls Calories Out?\\n\\n\\uf020 You either expend calories by using them, storing them for later use or excreting them as waste \\uf0b7\\uf020 We use calories through:\\n\\n\\uf06f\\uf020 BMR: Basal Resting Metabolism – the amount of calories we expend at rest just to exist as\\n\\nhuman beings ▪ Can be raised (This is what we want): eating, exercise, muscle mass (1lb of muscle expends\\n\\n40 calories/day)\\n\\n▪ Can be lowered (This is what we don’t want): skipping meals, starving, resting\\n\\n\\uf06f\\uf020 Exercise \\uf06f\\uf020 NEAT – Non-exercise activity thermogenesis - Spontaneous Activity \\uf06f\\uf020 Excess post-oxygen consumption (EPOC) – The extra energy we burn after a workout is done \\uf06f\\uf020 Food Thermogenesis – The energy expended to digest food; the cost of digesting foods differ\\n\\nThe bad news is that it’s a lot easier to put the calories in than it is to take the calories out. Think of it this way. How long does it take to burn 1000 calories? About 90 minutes of exercise or 10 miles of running! How long does it take to consume 1000 calories? In about 5-10 minutes! So nutrition is at least half the battle in terms of losing body fat or maintaining your ideal physique.\\n\\n49\\n\\nThere is no trick to eating well. It is the stuff we have all heard before. Drink lots of water. Consume your required intake of fruits, vegetables and whole grain products. Minimize fat, alcohol and sugar intake. But there seems to be a gap between knowing what to do and actually adhering to these simple guidelines. There is no special grapefruit, cabbage, Low-protein or High-protein diet or pill that will get you the results you want quickly. And knowledge alone is not power! We all know what we have to do! It is finding the motivation and inspiration to make and adhere to very small changes in our nutrition plan that will facilitate success. Finding the motivation to stick to a healthy nutrition plan day-in-day-out is all it takes. Here\\'s the good news - you don\\'t have to starve yourself and you don\\'t have to limit your diet to carrots and broccoli.\\n\\nWith nutrition, the very small changes to your eating habits will often bring about big differences. The new habits just need to be consistent on a long-term basis. Perhaps start with one area at a time. Once you have that habit mastered, tackle the next nutrition goal. One step at a time and soon your diet will provide you with all the nutrients necessary to achieve optimum health.\\n\\nIn this section, we’re going to provide you with some easy nutrition tips and guide you through designing your own nutrition program. Our philosophy with nutrition is very similar to our take on exercise. If we design your nutrition program for you and tell you that you\\'ve got to eat broccoli everyday, but you hate broccoli, you are not going to experience any success. You have got to be involved in the process. It is necessary for you to design a program that you realistically believe that you could follow for a life-time. Remember, we do not believe in any quick fixes. We\\'re talking about a life-long effort.\\n\\nImportant Principle to Grasp: If you want to lose body fat, diets DON’T work!\\n\\nHow many studies need to be completed that prove diets do not work before our society gets it? The diet industry is still a multi-billion dollar one and continues to thrive despite desperate pleading from leading scientists telling us that diets do not work. We need to wake up and take a dose of reality – if it sounds too good to be true, it probably is!\\n\\nYou see, when you diet your body actually starts to work against your efforts. As soon as you undertake a restricted caloric intake, your body moves into \"famine stage\" or \"starvation response\". Basically, your body does not know when its next meal will be and whether the energy intake will be sufficient for all its internal functions to operate optimally. So, your body, being such an effective piece of machinery, just slows all internal functions. You move into efficiency mode - a physical slowing down of metabolism. This is absolutely the last thing you want to happen. If you want to maximize fat loss, you definitely want to keep your metabolism revving at a high rate, not at a slow rate! The only way to do this is to eat properly and exercise.\\n\\nYou may notice that after you eat a meal, you feel warmer. The heat comes from digesting your meal. Your liver, pancreas, stomach and intestines have to produce digestive enzymes which requires energy. Many people who are starting to gain weight, conclude that their metabolism may be slowing down, and decide to eat less. This will depress their metabolism even more. The point here is that digestion requires energy and will raise your metabolic rate. If fat loss is your goal, you will want to ensure you are eating regularly enough to raise your metabolic rate to a point where you experience a caloric deficit. Dieting suppresses your metabolic rate! We must avoid this at all costs!\\n\\nLosing 10 pounds is easy. Lock yourself in a closet for a few days and consume just enough water to sustain life. By week\\'s end, you will definitely be 10 pounds lighter. You see when dieting, the scale shows positive confirmation that you are doing the right thing. You will definitely start to lose weight. But the problem is, if you are dieting and have lost 10 pounds, you have not lost 10 pounds of fat. Instead, you have lost only 2 pounds of fat, 3 pounds of water and 5 pounds of muscle. The muscle loss is the worst thing about quick weight loss diets. Muscle is an energy burning tissue and when dieting, you will lose a whole lot of it. You can imagine what that will do to your ability to burn calories both during rest and 50\\n\\nexercise. If fat loss is your goal, you must hang on very tightly to your muscle mass as this will keep your metabolism revving at a high rate.\\n\\nStudies have also shown that dieting actually makes you less likely to move throughout the day – you sit rather than stand, take an elevator instead of the stairs, fidget less at your desk – so that by the end of the day, even though you have reduced your food intake, you have also reduced your energy output. The bottom line: You lose no body fat.\\n\\nDieting also sets restrictions and limitations that are unrealistic and unsustainable in the long run. You most likely will end up bingeing and feeling like a failure.\\n\\nThat brings us to the most serious failure of diets: keeping the weight off. That is clearly the most difficult thing to do. Most people associate diets as a short-term phenomenon. They believe that as soon as they achieve the goal weight loss, they can go back to eating their normal diet. Of course, they inevitably gain all the weight back. When on a diet, a person will feel sensations of depression and deprivation. These are emotions they can not wait to rid of and so their thoughts center around the day when their diet finishes. A University of California study found that 90 percent of dieters who follow a prescribed diet eventually regain the weight they have lost. The 10 percent who were successful in keeping the weight off, 73 percent of them kept the weight off by just making healthy eating and lifestyle choices. So when you are deciding on a particular eating plan, ask yourself if you can realistically follow the eating plan for years. If not, stay away from it because as soon as you stop the plan, you will regain the weight. If a plan imposes strict limits or requires only a few types of foods, a red warning light should go off.\\n\\nThe bottom line is not new but it bears repeating: The only way to take weight off and keep it off is to exercise regularly and eat nutritiously. It makes sense to realize that if you want to weigh 10 pounds less, ten years from now, it is what you do over the next ten years, not the next 6 weeks! Short-term restrictive diets set people up for failure. A healthy nutrition plan that you believe you can realistically follow for the rest of your life is the only nutrition plan that will work!\\n\\nNutrition Habit #1 Consume a balanced diet that is rich in Fiber\\n\\nCarbohydrates (CHO): are fruits, vegetables and whole grain breads, pastas and rice. Carbohydrates in your diet will be sent to your liver and either burned for energy or stored as fat (70% conversion ratio). Did you know the only energy your brain can use is carbohydrates? That’s why low-carb diets never work for the long-term. You wind up being tired, irritable and have a hard time focusing.\\n\\nYou will want to ensure your diet is 60% carbohydrate content - Of this amount 50% should be in the form of fruits and vegetables and complex carbohydrates which are your whole grain products and no more than 10% from simple carbohydrates (cakes, cookies, ice cream etc.) Be sure to avoid white (enriched, refined, bleached) breads, pastas and rice. Avoid foods where sugars like High Fructose Corn Syrup are listed as one of the first few ingredients.\\n\\nAnd you\\'re also going to want to limit your intake of no-fat or low-fat products. You are probably thinking \"What? Limit no-fat foods? But aren\\'t they the answer to all my fat-loss prayers?\" It is interesting to note that since the explosion of no-fat products onto the market, our population continues to get fatter and fatter! You would think we would start to get skinnier as we consumed more of these no-fat products! But what do you think makes those no-fat products taste so good? Sugar –and lots of it! And what do you think sugar is made of? A lot of calories! Excess calories, whether they come from no-fat cookies or full-fat cookies, are still going to show up on our hips and thighs and abs.\\n\\n51\\n\\nProtein: Protein gets broken down into small amino acids which go to the liver to be used for growth, repair, and maintenance of muscles and tissues. If not used, it will be converted to glucose and then fat (70% conversion ratio)\\n\\nBalance your diet with 15-20% protein. You can go to our website at www.nwwomensfitness.com to determine your individual protein needs. Click on Member Zone. Then click on Cool Fitness Tools.\\n\\nGood Sources of Protein:\\n\\n\\uf020 Salmon, along with most other fishes and sea foods. \\uf0b7\\uf020 Poultry (w/out skin and white meat is leaner) \\uf0b7\\uf020 Beef (Lean cuts) \\uf0b7\\uf020 Pork (white cuts) \\uf0b7\\uf020 Soy Products \\uf0b7\\uf020 Egg Whites \\uf0b7\\uf020 Whey Products\\n\\nFat: Fats get broken down into smaller fatty acids and are used for cell functioning, insulation (protection and warmth) and energy. If not used, it becomes an amazing source of stored energy\\n\\n\\uf020 The average person carrying 30 pounds of body-fat is carrying 105,000 calories of stored energy\\n\\n– that’s enough energy to complete 40 marathons back to back!\\n\\nYour diet should be 20-30% fat content. Note: A no-fat diet is unrealistic and unhealthy.\\n\\nReducing Fat: While reading labels, look at the order of ingredients. If fat is listed as one of the first, second or third ingredients, the product is likely to be high in fat and is best to be limited or avoided. Items like lard, animal shortening, oils, butterfat, whole milk solids, shortening, and margarine are all fats.\\n\\nSome obvious foods that you are going to want to avoid are as follows: \\uf0b7\\uf020 Fried foods – fried foods are saturated in fat and oil and calories! \\uf0b7\\uf020 Creams – very high in fat content \\uf0b7\\uf020 Processed foods – like cakes and cookies, etc.\\n\\nWhile a reduction in fat is usually a good thing for most people, there is a point of diminishing returns and health risks. Just so you know, fat is the best fuel ever designed! We can make fat out of almost anything we eat and use it for energy. Can you imagine if your car could do that? Put in potatoes and the engine miraculously converts them into gas. In goes apples and instantly we get gasoline. Fat is an amazing fuel that provides us with a limitless amount of energy. Instead of hating fat and blaming it for all our problems, we should be astounded and respect it for its outstanding capabilities. Certain fatty acids are also necessary for good health, and \"fat soluble\" vitamins require fat for absorption into the system.\\n\\nIt is true that most people do not have to worry about getting too little fat in their diet, but there is another reason to be less obsessed about reducing fat to super-low levels; fat contributes to feelings of satiety (fullness) and helps reduce food cravings. Many people who cut a lot of fat out of their diets, often eat far too much of other ”non-fat\" foods that are high in calories. So the key is to just make sure that your total fat intake is within the accepted guidelines of 20-30% of total daily calories. No more than 10 percent of this should come from saturated fats. The average fat content of most diets is greater than 43 percent – this of course, is what is making our society fatter! When deciding to reduce your fat intake, remember that there are fats in your diet that are obvious – these are the ones you can see – foods such as butter, margarine, cooking oils, spreads, and fat on meat. And there are also fats that are hidden in processed foods such as cakes, cookies, ice cream and potato chips. It will be important to limit your intake from both these fat sources.\\n\\n52\\n\\nUnsaturated fats, especially the monounsaturated ones, are considered healthier and are found in nuts, seeds, olives, vegetable oils and soft margarine products. However, we’ve discovered many people consuming very high amounts of nuts because they’ve heard or read it’s healthy. A healthy amount of nuts is a HANDFUL. More than this and you are consuming a huge amount of calories. They call it “Trail- Mix” for a reason! You should be on a HIKING TRAIL expending a huge amount of calories to need the energy from the trail-mix. It’s not called “Office-Desk Mix” or “Sitting watching football Mix”!\\n\\nIncreasing your Omega 3 & 6 Fats found in fish, walnuts, olives, avocados, flaxseed is also a healthy habit. You can obtain healthy levels by eating a 4 ounce serving of fish three times per week or 2-gram fish oil every day or an ounce of walnuts a day.\\n\\nSaturated fats are found in animal products such as beef, butter, dairy products and lard. They tend to raise blood cholesterol levels, thereby increasing risk for heart disease. Also be cautious of consuming a large amount of coconut and palm oils. These are vegetable oils but they contain a large amount of saturated fat. You have probably also heard of trans fatty acids. These are the end products of a process called hydrogenation, in which vegetable oils are hardened. You should avoid consumption of this type of fat. Butter is a saturated fat and margarine contains trans fatty acids, both of which can increase the risk for heart disease.\\n\\nAs you begin to reduce the amount of fat and increase the amount of fruits, vegetables and whole grain products in your diet, your fiber intake will automatically increase. Fiber is so important in our diets because it keeps us full longer therefore, helping to suppress our appetites. But as you initially start to adopt many of these healthy habits, you may notice that you start to experience a lot more intestinal gas. To reduce the initial negative effects of a high fiber diet, change your diet gradually, and soon your body will adapt to your new, healthier diet. You may also want to consider taking a product that will help you manage these side-effects such as Beano. You’ll get the recommended 20-35 grams of fiber each day by consuming a minimum of 2 servings of fruit, 3 servings of vegetables and 4 servings of whole grains.\\n\\nSample Meals when you’re Busy:\\n\\nYou’ve got to get the kids ready for school…laundry started….dishwasher emptied. You’ve got emails to answer…Appointments and meetings to make…Projects to complete…Your daughter needs to be dropped off at soccer practice; your son at basketball. Many people report that life is so busy that it’s difficult to stick to a healthy eating plan and instead, they find themselves resorting to fast-food way too often. But eating well is what’s going to provide you the energy and the mental stamina to perform at your best. Here are some quick solutions to eating healthy:\\n\\nYou have got to eat breakfast no matter how busy you are. Think of it as filling up on an empty tank. Imagine how much better your engine will rev when it’s got what it needs. Try these balanced, quick breakfast options:\\n\\n\\uf020 \\uf0b7\\uf020 cold or hot cereal with milk and fruit \\uf0b7\\uf020 \\uf0b7\\uf020 peanut butter and banana sandwich \\uf0b7\\uf020 bagel with cream cheese and a piece of fruit \\uf0b7\\uf020 homemade muffin and a banana \\uf0b7\\uf020\\n\\nlow fat yogurt and some mixed raisins, granola and dried fruit\\n\\ntoast and fruit\\n\\nfruit smoothie made from milk, yogurt and fruit\\n\\n53\\n\\nHere are some easy, lunch ideas to go:\\n\\nraw veggies with a container of plain yogurt for dipping sandwiches (tuna in pita bread or thick whole wheat bread, vegetables & cheese on a bagel, turkey & vegetables in pita bread, ricotta cheese & jam on your favorite bread, hummus & tomato on a baguette, cottage cheese & pineapple on a kaiser bun) \\uf0b7\\uf020 pita pizzas with vegetables and tomato sauce \\uf0b7\\uf020 \\uf0b7\\uf020 \\uf0b7\\uf020 \\uf0b7\\uf020 baked potato \\uf0b7\\uf020 pasta salad made on the weekend\\n\\n\\uf020 \\uf0b7\\uf020\\n\\nlow fat crackers and cheese left-overs from dinner soup or chili made on the weekend\\n\\nNeed a quick pick-me-up?

So make the commitment to paying better attention to your nutrition, and enjoy the positive consequences to all areas of your life.\\n\\nFree Days:\\n\\nAnd when we say balanced - we really means balanced. A balanced diet will help you maintain a healthy body composition and weight and provide you with the nutrients for optimal health and functioning. All foods can be eaten in a healthy diet - you just need to have some boundaries and parameters. A successful nutrition plan will focus on what you need to be consuming every day rather than what you should not be eating. For example, set a goal of eating 3 fruits for the day instead of deciding to not eat any chocolate. In addition, allow yourself one or two \"free\" days every week. For example, if you love pizza, and chocolate, then one day a week allow yourself to indulge in these items. This will eliminate the feeling of being deprived of your favorite foods and you will be less likely to experience the inevitable binge that goes hand- in-hand with total elimination of your favorites. This type of plan is feasible for most people. You are not telling yourself you are never going to eat chocolate again, but instead, just limiting how much and when\\n\\n54\\n\\nyou will indulge. Just make sure you don’t go crazy on your free days. It’s not a free ticket to gorge! And try to avoid making deals with yourself regarding your free days. If Saturday is your free day, make sure you stick to Saturday. For example, avoid indulging on Thursday because there’s an office party and then promising that on Saturday, you will skip your free day. Often you end up of taking more free days than you agreed to and all of a sudden every day turns into a ‘free’ day.\\n\\nWe prefer to follow the 80:20 rule for nutrition, which states that if you are eating well 80 percent of the time, you can allow yourself to indulge the other 20 percent. Eating well 80 percent of the time will definitely keep you healthy and will be a much more enjoyable process. This type of belief system is long- term focused. It is important that you decide to only do things that you can see yourself doing for the rest of your life. The only way to do this is to achieve your goals while upsetting your life as little as possible. Look at it this way – even our NW Women’s Fitness Club Personal Trainers indulge so don’t try to be ‘perfect’. That will just set you up for disappointment!\\n\\nNutrition Habit #2 Drink More Water\\n\\nDid you know that 50-70% of our total body weight is water? The brain is composed of 70 percent water, lungs are nearly 90 percent water and our blood is about 83 percent water, which helps digest our food, transport and eliminate waste and toxins, mobilize fat, and control body temperature. Think of it this way, every tissue cell, organ and system is comprised of water and functions optimally only in the presence of adequate water levels. So even fat loss will not occur at an optimal rate if you are in a dehydrated state. Plus water helps to suppress our appetite.\\n\\nWater is our life force, in fact, we could only go a few days without water before our body would start to deteriorate and die. According to the American Dietetic Association’s Complete Food and Nutrition Guide, the average adult loses about two and a half quarts or about 10 cups of water daily through urine and sweat. Just cover your entire arm with a plastic bag and within a few minutes you’ll get a very visual display of how much water we lose in a day. Think of the good old-fashioned sweat suits designed to make you sweat and lose weight. Yeah, you lost weight but it wasn’t fat weight, it was very valuable water weight!\\n\\nTo maintain your body’s fluid balance, you need to replace at least the 10 cups of water (80 ounces) everyday. This amount needs to be increased in hot weather conditions or for those who exercise who may lose up to a liter per hour during a workout. Plus, as we age, there is a general loss of water in all tissues – it’s like the plum to prune effect! We’d personally prefer to be healthy, hydrated plums than dried up, old prunes so we drink our water!\\n\\nBut, unfortunately most people exist on a daily basis in a dehydrated state. In fact common complaints like headaches, lack of energy, feeling tired and lethargic, being prone to sickness and injury, kidney stones, constipation and achy joints and muscles have been associated with dehydration. If most people would commit to drinking 10 glasses of pure water every day they would notice a great improvement in their overall health, body composition and energy levels.\\n\\nKeep in mind though, we obtain water in our diets from drinks, either plain water or as part of other beverages and from solid foods, especially fruits and vegetables. So we encourage clients to get at least 80 ounces (10-8 ounce or 5-16 ounce glasses) of pure water and see how their body responds. Any other additional fluids you consume in the form of juice, milk, or herbal teas will be a bonus.\\n\\nIn the beginning, your body and its tissues are not used to this higher level of fluid and so they will initially just flush it out. And yes, you will be spending a great deal of time in the restroom but it won’t last long. Eventually, your need to run to the washroom all day should decrease. Your body will soon adapt to your hydrated state. You thirst mechanism will also become more efficient and you’ll find that the more you drink, the more thirsty you become. That’s a great sign!\\n\\n55\\n\\nMost people know they should be drinking more water but they don’t. We’ve found it’s not in the knowing, it’s in the doing! You’ll have to take some action steps to help you adhere to this goal. For example, purchase a water cooler for home and work so you always have cold, refreshing water available. Be sure to drink some water every time you pass the cooler. You can also purchase an 80 ounce water bottle from many grocery and department stores so you can fill up your bottle in the morning and make it a goal to finish the whole thing before you go to bed. This works great for us. Have your bottle with you wherever you go. If you don’t like the big water jug idea, drink a 16 ounce glass of water first thing in the morning and then 20 minutes before each meal and snack. You’ll easily hit 80 ounces. Many athletes use what’s called a ‘Camel-Back’, a water sac that hooks on like a back pack with a water-hose that allows you to drink easily and continuously throughout workouts. This is a great way to replenish all those extra fluids during tough workouts. During workouts, you should strive to drink 8 ounces of water every 15 minutes. Note: During long bouts of intense exercise (2 hours or more), you can drink TOO much water! It\\'s best to use a sports drink instead of just plain water, as this will help replace sodium and electrolytes lost in sweat and reduce the chances of developing hyponatremia, which can be life-threatening!\\n\\nTake our word for it – water is important to your overall health. We hope this clarifies and provides better insight to the importance of water in your diet.\\n\\nNutrition Habit #3 Plan your meals so that you consume 5 small meals and snacks throughout the day\\n\\nSee if you recognize yourself in any of the following. You skip breakfast, guzzle coffee all morning and then, practicing great self-control, you eat a tiny lunch. By mid-afternoon, you are starving and so you grab a quick pick-me-up chocolate bar or muffin. By the time you get home, you are hungry, irritable, tired and ready for dinner. You stuff yourself at the dinner table and then snack all evening. You go to bed on a full stomach, and tomorrow the cycle begins all over again.\\n\\nThis type of eating pattern is common and has your body working against you rather than for you. Many people who do not eat breakfast and consume only a very light lunch are tricked into believing that they are reducing their caloric intake when, in fact, they are actually setting themselves up for a snacking binge in the late afternoon, followed by an overload at dinner and into the evening. The result is just the opposite of what you intend: Total calories consumed during the day will end up being higher rather than lower! And the scale gives you the bad news that you are gaining weight.\\n\\nThe theory is this: Our bodies are not very good at burning calories from a big meal, especially in the evening when all our systems tend to slow down. Many of our evening calories, then, are more likely to be stored as fat.\\n\\nYour metabolism, the rate at which you burn calories for internal functions, is like an engine – the more often you give it fuel, the better it works. When you deprive your body of food, even for short periods of time, your metabolism automatically slows down in order to preserve energy. And a slowed metabolism makes it much more difficult to lose weight and much easier to gain weight. The type of diet that is not consistent in caloric and nutrient intake will also lead to a more rapid loss in muscle tissue - we want to avoid this at all costs. The good news is you can get your body to work for you instead of against you. The rule should be that you do not go any more than three to four hours without eating something.\\n\\nThink of starting your day by revving your internal engine. This means regardless of whether you are a breakfast person or not, you must develop the habit of having something to eat in the morning. Your momma was right – breakfast is the most important meal of the day but it does not need to be a 5-course meal. A piece of fruit, bagel, cereal and milk or toast and juice will do the trick. Then a few hours later, try a small snack like a piece of fruit and a cup of yogurt. By lunchtime, you are not going to have a\\n\\n56\\n\\nproblem making a healthy, low-fat, low-calorie choice. A half-sandwich and salad or bowl of chili or vegetable soup might be an appropriate lunch. A few hours later, in the afternoon, eat another light snack like a handful of walnuts, and some celery and carrot sticks or crackers and cheese. By the time dinner comes around, you will not be ravenous and you will be less likely to indulge and consume too many calories. This type of eating pattern keeps your metabolism revved all day, keeps your blood sugar at a healthy level, will keep your energy levels up and will help avoid the tendency to over-eat at any meal. You\\'ll be a lot more enjoyable to be around also. Most of us have been conditioned to believe that dinner should be the largest meal of the day, so changing your eating patterns is not going to be easy. It will not happen overnight. You will probably have to change other old habits too. If, for example, you snack in the evening while watching TV, you might need to go for a walk in the evening instead. If you find yourself bored in the evening and eating because there is nothing else to do, think about enrolling in an evening course or start reading a good book. Breaking habits is very difficult in the beginning but eventually it will become second nature.\\n\\nNutrition Habit #4 Stop Eating Three Hours before Bedtime\\n\\nIf you have planned your meals correctly throughout the day, you shouldn’t need to eat anything right before bed. Often the calories that are consumed after dinner are those that are eaten not because you are hungry and need the energy but because of habitual patterns or boredom. Think of it this way – you are just going to bed. How much energy do you really need? If you find yourself needing to eat late at night, choose something that is low in calories just to get you by until morning.\\n\\nNutrition habit #5 Control your Portion Sizes\\n\\nYou\\'ve got to pay attention to your portion sizes. We are victims of a society that is hooked on supersizing everything…supersize drinks, monster size cookies, muffins and bagels and astronomical sized restaurant entrees. For many of us, it may not be that our food choices are poor, we may just be eating too much of a good thing. Out of control portions will lead to weight gain and often cause people to feel lethargic.\\n\\nHere is a very important message to remember. If at the end of the day, you have expended fewer calories than the number of calories you have consumed from any source, you will store these calories as fat. Here is how it works:\\n\\nLet\\'s say you consume an extra 1,000 carbohydrate calories in the form of plain pasta. It takes about 30 percent of the calories consumed to break down the dietary carbohydrate and store it as body fat. So out of the 1,000 extra carbohydrate calories, 700 will be stored as body fat. Now, let\\'s say you consume an extra 1,000 fat calories in the form of creams. It takes about 3% of the calories consumed to break down this dietary fat and store it as body fat. So, out of the 1,000 extra fat calories, 970 will be stored as body fat.\\n\\nIt is obviously better to be consuming a diet rich in carbohydrates because less of the excess will actually be stored as body fat. But you will store excess carbohydrates as body fat and you will gain weight, whether your diet is low in fat or not. If your diet contains more calories than you expend in a day, you will gain weight regardless of the source of the calories.\\n\\nWhen reducing food intake and portion sizes, the reduction should occur in the following order: 1. Reduce fat intake 2. Reduce alcohol intake 3. Reduce sugar intake 4. Reduce starches (pasta, breads, rice)\\n\\n57\\n\\nIt is also wise to pay close attention to serving sizes listed on labels. Sometimes what is listed as one serving size is unrealistically small. So you may trick yourself into believing that you are consuming an item that is low in caloric and fat content, when in fact, what you are actually consuming is four times the listed serving size.\\n\\nHere are some realistic portion sizes: \\uf0b7\\uf020 A serving of meat, fish or poultry should be about the size of the palm of your hand \\uf0b7\\uf020 Your fruit and vegetable servings should be about the size of a tennis ball \\uf0b7\\uf020 A serving size of cottage cheese, rice, pasta, cereal or other starch is the size of a tennis ball \\uf0b7\\uf020 A slice of bread, one small roll, or a half bagel or bun counts as one serving \\uf0b7\\uf020 A serving of sandwich cheese is one slice \\uf0b7\\uf020 A serving size of fats, oils, nuts, seed is about the size of your thumb\\n\\nTechniques for Reducing Portion Sizes:\\n\\n\\uf020 Use a smaller plate. Instead of using a traditional dinner plate, use an appetizer/salad size plate\\n\\ninstead. This will force you to start with fewer calories right away. We’ve been taught as kids to eat what’s on our plate. So a bigger plate automatically means more calories.\\n\\n\\uf020 Divide your plate into 4 parts. A quarter of the plate will be reserved for a starch (whole grain rice, pasta, bread/roll), a quarter of the plate will be reserved for protein and the last half of the plate should be reserved for fruits and/or vegetables.\\n\\n\\uf020 20 minutes before you eat your meal, have a cup of soup, a handful of walnuts, a small salad, a\\n\\ncup of juice or 8-16 ounces of water. This will help to suppress your appetite.\\n\\n\\uf020 To help control portions, keep a food log and submit it to a professional.\\n\\n\\uf020 To help avoid mindless, late-night eating, brush your teeth after dinner. Pop a breath mint or breath\\n\\nstrip. Go for a walk. Read a book. Take a bath.\\n\\n\\uf020 Buy single serving items or place snacks in small plastic baggies to help control portions.\\n\\n\\uf020 Avoid buying in bulk. Studies show that when people buy in bulk, they also eat in bulk. Remember –\\n\\nif it’s there, you’ll eat it!\\n\\n\\uf020 Eat slowly. The brain needs 20 minutes to receive the signal that you’re full.\\n\\n\\uf06f\\uf020 After food is placed in front of you, wait 5 minutes before you eat \\uf06f\\uf020 Place small mouthfuls of food on fork/spoon \\uf06f\\uf020 Completely swallow food before you add more food to fork/spoon \\uf06f\\uf020 Put down utensils in between bites \\uf06f\\uf020 Use smaller utensils \\uf06f\\uf020 Consciously take time to taste, chew and savor food \\uf06f\\uf020 Stretch out meals, making them last 30 minutes. Take a five minute break about 10 minutes into\\n\\nyour meal\\n\\n\\uf06f\\uf020 Take sips of water or other non-caloric beverages between bites \\uf06f\\uf020\\n\\nIntroduce a one or two minute delay between courses\\n\\n\\uf020 When eating out:\\n\\n\\uf06f\\uf020 Order one meal and ask for two plates so you can split the meal. \\uf06f\\uf020 Don’t order super-size meals; opt for regular or kiddie portions instead \\uf06f\\uf020 Share desserts\\n\\n58\\n\\n\\uf06f\\uf020 Order water immediately \\uf06f\\uf020 Order butter and salad dressing on the side \\uf06f\\uf020 Ask for your meat broiled and without any additional fat added \\uf06f\\uf020 Ask for your chicken to be prepared without the skin \\uf06f\\uf020 Order a salad instead of french fries \\uf06f\\uf020 Ask for skim milk \\uf06f\\uf020 Order a tomato instead of cream sauce for pasta dishes \\uf06f\\uf020 Order plain bread instead of garlic bread \\uf06f\\uf020 Take one piece of bread from the basket and then ask for the basket to be taken away.\\n\\nOr ask for a complimentary vegetable platter instead of bread basket.\\n\\n\\uf06f\\uf020 Order tomato and broth soups instead of cream-based soups \\uf06f\\uf020 Order fresh fruit desserts \\uf06f\\uf020 Hold the sauce on burgers and instead use ketchup, mustard, relish, tomato and lettuce \\uf06f\\uf020 Do not be afraid to ask for any type of substitution\\n\\nThe Hunger Scale – Learn to use this scale to rate your hunger and fullness\\n\\n0 – Ravenous, Primal Hunger. I’m so hungry I could die! 1 – Extremely Hungry, dizzy, shaky, faint 2 – Very hungry, irritable, finding it hard to concentrate 3 – Stomach growling 4 – Hungry but not ravenous 5 - Totally comfortable 6 – Feeling like I ate too much 7 - Stomach is stretched/uncomfortable 8 – Very Full/Stuffed 9 – Very Full and Bloated/Overstuffed 10 – So Full it Hurts, Feels like I’m going to explode, Feel sick to my stomach\\n\\n\\uf020 LEVELS 0-2: Signifies ravenous hunger. This is when you are most likely to overeat. \\uf0b7\\uf020 LEVELS 3-4: These are the best times to eat. Your body is saying that it needs food. \\uf0b7\\uf020 LEVELS 5-10: Starting to eat at these levels indicates emotional, not physical hunger.\\n\\n\\uf06f\\uf020 Eating until you reach level 6 and higher may indicate that you\\'ve lost touch with your physical\\n\\nhunger.\\n\\nBecome aware of your impulses and urges:\\n\\n\\uf020 What traps you into overeating? Is it a certain time of day? Is it the people you hang with? Is it paired with some type of activity? Do you get the urge to eat in certain places? Do you turn to food when you’re tired after work?\\n\\n\\uf020 Make a list of substitute activities. They must be activities that compete with the action of\\n\\neating - ie. it’s difficult to eat while doing the activity.\\n\\n\\uf06f\\uf020 Hobby, gardening, play a game with family/friends, learn a new sport, visit your\\n\\nneighbors/friends, write in a journal, give yourself a manicure, read a magazine/book, plan your next vacation, Relaxation/breathing exercises, walk/jog/swim/bike ride/go to gym/exercise video/dance to some upbeat music, shower, bath, get a massage, listen to music, prayer, meditation, housework, pay bills, balance your check book, complete a home improvement project, rearrange your furniture, wash your car, clean out closets/drawers, run errands, floss, take dog for a walk, video games\\n\\n\\uf020 Then when your impulse or urge surfaces, immediately start your substitute activity. The urge\\n\\nshould pass.\\n\\n59\\n\\nIf you recognize that you need to focus on controlling your portion sizes, you may initially feel a bit hungry for a few weeks. But that hunger-sensation won’t last long. Your stomach is capable of shrinking and will learn to be satisfied with the smaller meals. Plus when you’re eating the right type of foods, you’ll have more energy and your appetite will effectively suppressed making your plan much easier to adhere to.\\n\\nNutrition Habit #6 Commit to Shopping at least once per week and stocking up on healthy choices.\\n\\nWhat happens if you get home and you are starved and there is nothing to eat? You are more likely to choose a less-healthy item or dial up a take-out restaurant and order something high in fat and calories. If you want to commit to a healthy diet, you have got to commit to setting up a framework for success. This includes planning a trip to the grocery shop weekly and then potentially one or two smaller trips during the week to top up on fresh fruits and veggies. You can not expect to adhere to a healthy diet without making this very important commitment to yourself.\\n\\n\\uf020 Shop from a grocery list prepared when you are not hungry or stressed out \\uf0b7\\uf020 Determine exactly what you need for a particular period of time. This is where meal-planning for the week ahead really helps. For example, keep what you’ll eat for breakfast, lunch and snacks pretty simple and consistent. Then decide what you’ll eat for dinners each night. For example, Monday you’ll make a home-made vegetarian pizza. Tuesday, you’ll make salmon, vegetables and rice. Wednesday, you’ll do a chicken, vegetable pasta marinara and salad. Thursday, you’ll do a shrimp and vegetable stir-fry. Friday, you’ll eat out. Saturday, you’ll do chicken burgers, vegetables and salad. And Sunday, you’ll make chicken, bean and vegetable burritos. Then buy what you need to make each meal throughout the week. Don’t overbuy – Be careful of bulk buying.\\n\\n\\uf020 Never go grocery shopping when you’re hungry. \\uf0b7\\uf020 As soon as you get home, plan time to clean, cut and chop fresh produce to ensure it’s ready to be eaten (unless you buy the pre-cut and washed). Cook-a-thons will also make sticking to your nutrition plan a lot easier. Opening the fridge to find a bowl of chili, home-made soup, pasta salad or chopped vegetables will make it more likely that you grab for these healthier items.\\n\\nGreat foods to put in your shopping cart:\\n\\nWhole Grains: \\uf0b7\\uf020 Oatmeal \\uf0b7\\uf020 Cold cereal – Cherrios, , Bran, Granola \\uf0b7\\uf020 100% whole grain bread or English muffins (or other bread products) \\uf0b7\\uf020 100% whole wheat pitas \\uf0b7\\uf020 100% whole wheat tortillas \\uf0b7\\uf020 100% whole wheat pizza shells \\uf0b7\\uf020 Brown Rice \\uf0b7\\uf020 100% whole wheat pasta\\n\\nMeats:\\n\\n\\uf020 Skinless, boneless chicken breast halves and/or frozen cut-up chicken for stir-fries \\uf0b7\\uf020 Skinless salmon filets / 1 whole fish \\uf0b7\\uf020 Skinless turkey breasts \\uf0b7\\uf020 Sliced cooked salmon, turkey or chicken \\uf0b7\\uf020 White porkchops \\uf0b7\\uf020 Ground turkey or lean beef \\uf0b7\\uf020 Frozen chicken or vegetable meat patties\\n\\n60\\n\\nDairy:\\n\\n\\uf020 Skim milk or low-fat soy/rice/oatbran milk fortified with vitamin D and calcium \\uf0b7\\uf020 Eggs \\uf0b7\\uf020 1 bag of part-skim shredded mozzarella cheese \\uf0b7\\uf020 Container of feta-cheese \\uf0b7\\uf020 Low-fat probiotic Yogurt cups\\n\\nFrozen Foods:\\n\\n\\uf020 Bags of frozen veggies – green beans, peas, broccoli, corn, stir-fry \\uf0b7\\uf020 Bags of frozen fruit – blueberries, raspberries, strawberries \\uf0b7\\uf020 Frozen Meals – Lean Cuisine or Healthy Choice – When you’re too tired to cook or in a hurry, these are life savers. They are low in salt, calories, fat and Trans-fats plus they’re actually quite yummy!\\n\\nCanned/Jarred Foods:\\n\\n\\uf020 Beans \\uf0b7\\uf020 Soups – look for low sodium \\uf0b7\\uf020 Tomato Sauce \\uf0b7\\uf020 Kalamata Olives \\uf0b7\\uf020 Sun-dried tomatos \\uf0b7\\uf020 Soy-nut peanut butter or all-natural peanut butter (no trans fat, no added sugar)\\n\\nDrinks:\\n\\n\\uf020 Bottled Water/Flavored Water \\uf0b7\\uf020 100% Orange with pulp/Cranberry/Grapefruit Juice (fortified with calcium, magnesium and Vit. D) \\uf0b7\\uf020 V-8 (low sodium) \\uf0b7\\uf020 Green Tea\\n\\nFresh Produce: Fruits/Vegetables\\n\\n\\uf020 You’ve got complete freedom in this area. Buy what you love. Here’s some must haves… \\uf0b7\\uf020 3-5 bags of salad mix like Romaine, Spinach or Mixed Greens (make it easy to make salads\\n\\neveryday)\\n\\n\\uf020 Bag of cut-up stir-fry veggies \\uf0b7\\uf020 Pre-cut and washed veggies – carrots, broccoli, sweet peas, cauliflower, celery, asparagus,\\n\\nmushrooms (make it easy to eat your veggies!)\\n\\n\\uf020 Peppers – red, yellow, orange, green \\uf0b7\\uf020 Tomatos/Cucumbers/Onions \\uf0b7\\uf020 Apples/Pears/Grapes/Bananas/Oranges/Grapefruit/Tangerines – plus whatever is in season\\n\\nSpices/Extras: \\uf0b7\\uf020 Olive oil \\uf0b7\\uf020 Salt/Pepper/Garlic \\uf0b7\\uf020 Soy sauce – low sodium \\uf0b7\\uf020 Balsamic vinegar \\uf0b7\\uf020 Salad dressing/Salad spritzers - vinaigrettes are a great choice \\uf0b7\\uf020 Marinara sauce \\uf0b7\\uf020 Cinnamon \\uf0b7\\uf020 Other favorite spices \\uf0b7\\uf020 Flaxseed \\uf0b7\\uf020 Psyliium\\n\\n61\\n\\nSnack-Foods:\\n\\n\\uf020 Rice Cakes \\uf0b7\\uf020 Popcorn \\uf0b7\\uf020 Nuts – raw walnuts/almonds unsalted– don’t buy too much. And once you get them home, put them\\n\\nin mini-ziplock snack bags separated 10 to a bag\\n\\n\\uf020 Dried fruits – apricots, cranberries, apples… \\uf0b7\\uf020\\n\\nIf you have a real sweet tooth and are looking for healthier options to prevent the 500 plus calorie dessert binges, try the following: \\uf06f\\uf020 Yogurt and granola \\uf06f\\uf020 Weight-watcher deserts – they typically keep them at 100 calories per serving \\uf06f\\uf020 Pudding cups – 60 calories per cup \\uf06f\\uf020 Gum/Small bag of hard candies – when you feel a craving coming on, chew on some gum or\\n\\npop a hard candy and suck on it for a while. It will often do the trick.\\n\\n\\uf06f\\uf020 Frozen yogurt – but just buy the smaller cartons to prevent eating a whole gallon\\n\\nNutrition Habit #7 Eliminate any unhealthy temptations from your environment (work, home, car) and replace with\\n\\nhealthy alternatives.\\n\\nIf you’re like most people, if it’s there staring you in the face, you’ll eat it. Make it more difficult to access the foods that stumble you and sabotage your efforts. Eliminate the following from your environment:\\n\\n\\uf020 Cookies, chocolate bars, pastries, candy and any high-calorie, sweetened snack foods \\uf0b7\\uf020 Salty foods such as potato chips, pretzels, taco chips, crackers, and other packaged munchies \\uf0b7\\uf020 White bread, white rolls, white buns \\uf0b7\\uf020 \\uf0b7\\uf020 Quick-fix prepared foods such as pizza, fried entrees and dinners, microwavable sandwiches \\uf0b7\\uf020 High-fat spreads and dips \\uf0b7\\uf020 Sugared soft drinks and beverages \\uf0b7\\uf020 Alcoholic beverages \\uf0b7\\uf020 Any food that can be classified as junk food or that you habitually binge on\\n\\nIce cream and high-sugar frozen deserts\\n\\nNutrition Habit #8 Avoid or Limit alcohol in your Diet\\n\\nAlthough alcohol is low in fat content, it is very high in empty calories. In addition, alcohol activates the enzyme that uptakes fat from our bloodstream and stores it in our fat cells. Therefore any food you consume in combination with alcohol will more likely end up in our fat storage depot areas like our hips, thighs and abs. And finally, alcohol lowers our inhibitions making us more likely to make poorer food choices. So practice moderation in this area please.\\n\\nNutrition Habit #9 Take a multi-vitamin everyday\\n\\nAs insurance to a healthy diet, we are going to recommend you take one multi-vitamin every day. Choose one that is as close to 100 percent of the requirements of as many of the vitamins and minerals as possible.\\n\\nYou know what they say - you are what you eat and what you put into your body. If you are serious about your health and fitness, adhere to the suggestions in this chapter. Looking good, feeling great and living life to the fullest is definitely within your reach.\\n\\n62\\n\\nSECTION SIX\\n\\nLIFESTYLE CHANGES\\n\\nOur deepest fear is not that we are inadequate.\\n\\nOur deepest fear is\\n\\nthat we are powerful beyond measure.\\n\\nIt is our light not our darkness\\n\\nthat most frightens us.\\n\\nWe ask ourselves,\\n\\nwho am I to be brilliant,\\n\\ngorgeous, talented and fabulous?\\n\\nActually, who are you not to be?\\n\\nYou are a child of God.\\n\\nYour playing small doesn’t serve the world.\\n\\nThere’s nothing enlightening about shrinking\\n\\nso that other people won’t feel insecure around you.\\n\\nWe were born to make manifest\\n\\n63\\n\\n64\\n\\nMove that Body!\\n\\nNEAT or Non-Exercise Activity Thermogenesis is the amount of calories we expend from activity that is not exercise related. Lack of time is the number one reason people say they can not participate in an exercise program. The good news is that just being active throughout the day means you do not have to spend hours at the gym! The problem is we have simply become too sedentary. The age of technology is making us fat. Escalators, elevators, remote controls, garage door openers, computers, home banking, the Internet.. The International Journal on Obesity estimates that we expend 500-800 calories less per day than we did a few decades ago. So all of the labor saving devices that are supposed to be making life easier are in fact making our health and our lives a lot worse.\\n\\nHere are some ways to increase daily caloric expenditure without actually \"exercising\": \\uf0b7\\uf020 Park one or two blocks away from wherever you’re going and walk there \\uf0b7\\uf020 Walk or cycle if your destination is less than 20 minutes away \\uf0b7\\uf020 Always park in the farthest parking stall instead of hunting for the perfect spot right in front of the shop \\uf0b7\\uf020 Take the stairs if you need to go fewer than 5 flights \\uf0b7\\uf020 Take a 10 minute walk before work, at lunch or after dinner \\uf0b7\\uf020 Schedule active outings with your family or friends (hikes, cycling, walks, swimming, kayaking, indoor\\n\\nrockclimbing)\\n\\n\\uf020 Do a few knee bends, heel raises or toe taps while making dinner \\uf0b7\\uf020 Do a few light exercises during TV commercials \\uf0b7\\uf020 At work, get up, move and stretch every 30 minutes. (Your back will thank you for it too.) \\uf0b7\\uf020 Sign up for a course (gardening, ballroom dancing, pottery); it will keep you busy and get you out of the\\n\\nhouse\\n\\nOne study at the University of South Carolina found that we expend approximately 10 calories less per day as a result of just using remote controls. 10 calories less – it does not sound like a lot. But 10 calories here and 15 calories there – it all adds up. It is easy to see how people are putting weight on so easily and so quickly. In this day and age, it is a lot easier to eat 3,500 excess calories than it is to expend 3,500 calories.\\n\\nIf you are exercising three hours per week, what are you doing the other 165 hours? How you spend the time outside of your exercise sessions will make a huge difference to your efforts and ultimately your results. Being active throughout the day will not take up any more of your time but you will end up burning more calories and feeling a lot better!\\n\\nThe Importance of Sleep: More and more literature is touting the importance of sleep in terms of health and fat loss. We now understand that when the body doesn’t get the 7-8 hours of sleep every night that it needs to rejuvenate/repair/heal, it finds ways to compensate for the lower levels of serotonin or dopamine caused by lack of sleep. It does this by increasing appetite and craving foods with sugar and fats that instantly give you the immediate release of serotonin and dopamine. It also causes you to store more fat as a defense mechanism to provide the energy to help manage the longer days. So get to bed early! Plus if you’re in bed at a decent hour, you’ll be less likely to be munching!\\n\\nManage your Stress: There has been quite a bit of research recently measuring stress hormones and how they affect our fat cells and fat metabolism. Dr. Pamela Peeke has been the leading researcher in this area and she has found that our body interprets any kind of stress in our live as physical stress and immediately responds using the \"Fight or Flight\" response. Unfortunately, most of the stress in our lives is not physical stress but rather, work, kids, financial etc - more of the emotional or mental type of stress. But nonetheless, as our stress increases, the stress hormone, cortisol, is released into the blood stream.\\n\\n65\\n\\nCortisol has two negative effects in terms of fat loss. One, it causes the body to crave more fat and sugar. And secondly, it causes the body to uptake more fat into the fat cells in order to store energy. Both act a defense mechanism to provide the body with energy to fight off the stress - unfortunately, since we\\'re not really undergoing physical stress instead, we just get fatter. Plus high levels of stress have been associated with increased risk for cardiovascular disease. The message is clear. If you want to obtain optimal health, you need to manage your stress. Take baths, get massages, write in a journal, read, pray, practice deep breathing, participate in Tai Chi, Yoga or meditation classes. Do whatever it takes to either interpret your stress differently or take care of yourself so that stress doesn\\'t tear you down.\\n\\nThink Positive and Get Healthy & Lose Fat: Thinking positive provides numerous health benefits, but did you know it will also help you lose body fat? Fat loss is a complex psychological phenomenon and can often result in a vicious cycle of weight loss and weight gain.\\n\\nFor example, if we make a conscious decision to drastically reduce our caloric intake, we will instantly experience deprivation. This will often result in feelings of anger as we question why others can eat Haagen-Daaz and chocolate and not struggle with their weight. Our will-power slowly dwindles and inevitably we give in to one of our temptations. We feel like a failure and decide, since we have screwed up, we might as well \"go for the gusto\" and binge out on all our favorites. Afterwards, we feel out of control and guilty for our actions. We feel hopeless and desperate and turn to food to comfort us. This just fuels our insecurities and low self-esteem as we start to believe we are fat, ugly and a loser. We decide the only way to feel better is to lose the weight and the cycle starts again!\\n\\nPart of initiating a fitness program is understanding the psychology of our behaviors and actions. There are lots of things we can do to gain control of our actions.\\n\\nOne aspect of gaining control is understanding the role of negative and irrational thinking. We are often our own worst critics and can be very hard on ourselves. Here are some things you might have said to yourself which might have sabotaged your efforts:\\n\\n\\uf020 \\uf0b7\\uf020 \\uf0b7\\uf020 Since I pigged out at lunch, the whole day is ruined. I might as well stuff myself today and start all over\\n\\nI missed my workout. The whole day is ruined. Why can’t I ever stick to anything? If I do not starve myself I will get fat!\\n\\nagain tomorrow!\\n\\n\\uf020 Things always go wrong! I am such a failure! \\uf0b7\\uf020 \\uf0b7\\uf020 \\uf0b7\\uf020 Once I get a six-pack then all the girls will be in love with me. I will be happy once I lose the weight! \\uf0b7\\uf020 \\uf0b7\\uf020 My thighs are the fattest I have ever seen! \\uf0b7\\uf020 \\uf0b7\\uf020 Why do I have such little will-power? \\uf0b7\\uf020 Why couldn\\'t I just have been born with a perfect body? I have got to lose 20 pounds within a month to get ready for my vacation or my holidays will be ruined! \\uf0b7\\uf020 I must never eat anything fattening! \\uf0b7\\uf020 \\uf0b7\\uf020 These things always happen to me! \\uf0b7\\uf020 \\uf0b7\\uf020\\n\\nIt is not the diet program that is wrong, it is me! I might have lost 10 pounds but I can not go to the beach until I am a perfect size six!\\n\\nIf I get skinny then my boyfriend will pay more attention to me.\\n\\nI will always be like this! I can\\'t seem to do anything right!\\n\\n66\\n\\nMany wise sayings express the effects our thinking has on our behaviors.\\n\\n\"Energy follows thought. You actually become what you think.\" Lynne Namka\\n\\n\"Change your thoughts and you change your world\" Norman V. Peale\\n\\n\"Negative thinking will always lead to failure; but positive faith – positive thinking – will lead you towards happy, healthy and abundant living.\" Albert E. Cliffe\\n\\n\"If you realized how powerful your thoughts are, you would never think a negative thought. They can have a powerful influence for good when they\\'re on the positive side, and they can and do make you physically ill when they\\'re on the negative side.\" Peace Pilgrim\\n\\nWe can not take our thoughts lightly because they can directly affect our biology, our feelings, actions and our progress. There are things that we can do immediately to overcome or control negative or irrational thinking. Here are some tips.\\n\\nMethods for overcoming negative or irrational thinking:\\n\\n1. Listen to your thoughts at the times when you feel worst. 2. Listen for irrational/negative thinking. 3. Dispute these thoughts by asking \"Why is this so?\" \"Where is this negativity coming from?\" and \"Could there be another possible explanation or interpretation?\" For example, replace negative thoughts with empowering ones such as this:\\n\\n\\uf020\\n\\nI’ve reached an expected plateau. That’s a good sign. My body is adjusting to the positive changes I’ve made. I’ll make some changes to my program to stimulate further progress\\n\\n\\uf020 As long as I continue working on my weight, I’ll achieve the goals I have set for myself. I’ll take\\n\\nconsistent action steps every day.\\n\\n\\uf020 No matter what happens, I’ll stay the course. If I do what is required, I will succeed. \\uf0b7\\uf020 Quitting will get me nowhere. I’ll analyze my schedule and make exercise a protected priority. \\uf0b7\\uf020 \\uf0b7\\uf020 \\uf0b7\\uf020 \\uf0b7\\uf020 The fitter I get, the more fun I have, and the more activities I can participate in. Life is more fun\\n\\nI feel great. I know I’m not at my goal yet but I’ve lost 20 pounds and increased my fitness level. I’ll stick to my program, a day at a time. Whatever I lose will be a positive. I am learning to love my God-given body, and I love how I feel and look.\\n\\nthan ever.\\n\\n\\uf020 Call yourself a runner, a dancer, a body builder, a health enthusiast….something with a winning\\n\\nidentity. Never think or call yourself a loser or failure.\\n\\n4. Imagine repeating what you have said to a close friend or child. We could never imagine talking to others as we often talk to ourselves. The next time you catch yourself thinking irrationally or negatively, ask yourself if you would ever speak this way to another human being. You deserve the same type of respect you would give anybody else! Remind yourself that if you continually practice negative self-talk, eventually, you may actually start to believe your own words. Your self-esteem can end up taking a real beating.\\n\\n5. Displace continuing irrational beliefs by techniques of\\n\\n\\uf020 Thought stopping. When worrying, instantly think of a stop sign and then focus on pleasant\\n\\nthoughts.\\n\\n\\uf020 Stress management. When worrying, participate in your favorite relaxation techniques like\\n\\nmassage, reading, baths, journal writing, etc.\\n\\n\\uf020 Thought reversal. Have positive messages or quotes posted around your work or home\\n\\nenvironment to help you put things into perspective.\\n\\n67\\n\\n6. Learn to live in the moment and to experience true joy in your life. Stop worrying about the past or the future. Most people have a very difficult time living in the now. Try this easy drill. Shut your eyes. Listen and try to identify all the sounds around you. Smell for different scents. Open your eyes and really look around you. Observe all the different colors and objects. The next time you eat, try to eat slowly and taste every single bite. Quick drills like this will help you to develop your skills of living in the moment.\\n\\n7. Each night before you fall asleep, make a mental note of what was the best part of your day or of\\n\\nsomething that you experienced that you really appreciated or enjoyed. By doing this, you will learn to look for the good things in life.\\n\\n8. Live today! Self-hatred takes a lot of time and energy. Obsessing about your body weight, nutrition plan and exercise program leaves you tired and depressed. Deciding to not enjoy the here-and-now because you have decided to wait until you lose the weight will leave you feeling deprived and will often lead to more negative feelings and behaviors. Remember that thin thighs, a small butt and a 6-pack set of abdominals is not the ticket to a meaningful existence. Fill your life with interesting experiences and people and you will enjoy a much higher quality of life.\\n\\nBreaking Old Habits:\\n\\nAs humans, we are creatures of habit, and often do things not because we need to but rather because it is just the way we have always done them.\\n\\nSome common examples are: \\uf0b7\\uf020 Salting your food \\uf0b7\\uf020 Eating during commercials \\uf0b7\\uf020 Always purchasing food at the movies \\uf0b7\\uf020 Eating while studying \\uf0b7\\uf020 Always over-eating at parties \\uf0b7\\uf020 Snacking while making dinner \\uf0b7\\uf020 Eating poorly when you are with friends \\uf0b7\\uf020 Always eating the same amount of food regardless of your hunger level \\uf0b7\\uf020 Stopping for an ice-cream or treat on your way home from a weekend destination regardless of your\\n\\nhunger level\\n\\nThe movies just would not be the same without popcorn! This is a habit and often, people will find themselves ordering popcorn even though they have just had dinner and are feeling quite full. Another example would be the mid-way rest-stop when coming home from the cottage or a weekend ski-trip. People will get into the habit of stopping for a Dairy Queen Blizzard or one of their other favorite treats regardless of their hunger level. Students will often get into the habit of eating while studying for exams.\\n\\nThe first step to getting control of these nutritional habits is to become aware of your patterns. A daily exercise and nutrition logbook will allow you to track your behaviors and will make patterns and habits very obvious. Once you discover what actually stimulates your less-than-healthy behavior, you have the choice of either changing the stimulus or situation or changing your response to the stimulus or situation.\\n\\nHere are the action steps you can take to overcoming habitual patterns.\\n\\nStep one: Recognize what stimulates the unhealthy action. Become aware of the habit. Monitor what you eat, when you eat, who you are with and how you felt.\\n\\nStep two: Change the stimulus\\n\\n68\\n\\nStep three: Change the response\\n\\nFor example:\\n\\nUnhealthy behavior\\n\\nChange stimulus\\n\\nChange response\\n\\nWhenever I am depressed I eat junk food\\n\\nWhenever I go out with Patti, we always drink too much and eat terribly\\n\\nEvery Friday night, friends come over to watch a rental movie and I always eat 8 slices of pizza Every time I eat ice cream, I always order a double scoop I always eat 2 sandwiches at lunch I always go to the cafeteria and buy 2 chocolate chip cookies for my mid-afternoon break\\n\\nTry not to get overly depressed, instead examine whether there could be any positive outcomes from the depressing situation. Try to develop the skills to become optimistic When you go out with Patti, bring along another friend who may be a better influence\\n\\nInstead of watching a movie, schedule a hike or a walk with your friends\\n\\nInstead of ordering ice cream, order a fruit salad Bring a bowl of chili to lunch\\n\\nTake a short walk on your break instead\\n\\nWhen you get depressed, watch a funny movie or call a best friend or go for a long walk\\n\\nYou and Patti make a healthy dinner at home and then go out dancing both agreeing that you will drink 2 glasses of water for every beer or alcoholic drink Order Japanese food instead of pizza\\n\\nOrder 1 scoop of ice cream instead of 2 Eat 1 sandwich and a small salad Bring a few fig newtons to work for your break\\n\\nLearning to Love your Body\\n\\nOften people have very unrealistic expectations of the type of body they would like to achieve. They often refer to popular magazines for an image of their ideal body. But they are ignorant of the fact that many of the models are 23 percent underweight and have been made-up for hours. Camera tricks are used and once the photos have been developed, the pictures are cropped, airbrushed and manipulated by computer to produce an unrealistic, unhealthy, and so-called \"perfect\" image. So be realistic with yourself!\\n\\n“Even I don’t wake up looking like Cindy Crawford.” Cindy Crawford\\n\\nIt is important for you to examine your genetics and to understand that fat loss is partially dependent on your genetic breakdown. Approximately 40-50 percent of \"fatness\" is genetically determined. You cannot change this! But you do have a choice. For example, if you are a pear shaped individual and everyone in your family is pear shaped, you can either choose to be an in-shape, lean, muscular pear shape or an out-of- shape, fatter pear shape, but you are always going to be a pear shape! So examine your parents and your family to determine the types of expectations you can place upon yourself. But don’t get discouraged just because your entire family struggles with weight. You still have 50% of the equation that you can control. And just because your family is overweight doesn’t mean you are destined to struggle with your weight for your entire life. It does probably mean though that you will have to work a bit harder and be a bit smarter than someone who was born to lean parents.\\n\\n69\\n\\n70\\n\\nSECTION SEVEN\\n\\nACTIVITY & NUTRITION LOGS\\n\\n“Live your life each day\\n\\nas you would climb a mountain.\\n\\nAn occasional glance toward the summit\\n\\nkeeps the goal in mind,\\n\\nbut many beautiful scenes\\n\\nare to be observed\\n\\nfrom each new vantage point”\\n\\n71\\n\\n72\\n\\nKeeping a Food and Activity Log\\n\\nStudies have shown that just the act of writing your exercise and food intake down significantly improves your habits. Also, a journal will point out bad habits or patterns that you have developed. Just noticing these slips is the first step to improving your lifestyle. Most of our clients have had a lot of success with recording their diet and activity on a daily basis and turning in their forms to their trainer to review.\\n\\nWe have supplied you with one week’s worth of logs with a summary page at the end. To continue logging, please visit our website at www.nwwomensfitness.com. Click on Services, click on Personal Training, click on Forms & Questionnaires the click on Activity and Nutrition Log. At the start of each week, print 7 copies of this form and the Weekly Synopsis, complete it each day and turn it into your trainer at the end of each week.\\n\\nYou can also utilize online Exercise and Nutrition Logs such as www.livestrong.com/myplate, www.sparkpeople.com or www.fitday.com.\\n\\nSome important points to record:\\n\\nTime of eating: Record precisely when you eat or drink anything. You may notice you either consistently eat too late, most of your calories are consumed too late in the day, you\\'re eating too few meals or that you\\'re leaving too much time between eating.\\n\\nWhat you\\'re eating and drinking: This data is very important and you are going to want to be exact and precise. It helps if you carry your log book with you so you can record your meal right after you eat. You should record every single thing you put in your mouth and exactly how much of it. Portion size is critical to help you determine where you can cut back if you need to reduce your caloric intake. Be sure to include water intake. It is helpful to do a summary at the bottom of each page that adds up exactly how many fruits, vegetables, grain servings, dairy products and glasses of water you consumed. That will help you determine on a daily basis if you\\'re meeting all your requirements.\\n\\nWhere you\\'re eating and who you\\'re eating with: You may notice that when you sit in front of the TV you always eat or eat too much. You may discover that on the weekends when you go out with friends you always overeat. You could possibly be a social eater.\\n\\nHow you are feeling during each meal: Are you bored, lonely, depressed, excited, happy, stressed out? You may determine that you are an emotional eater and will need to come up with a list of alternative activities to do when you\\'re experiencing these feelings.\\n\\nHow you are feeling after each meal: Did you overeat or eat just until you were comfortably satisfied?\\n\\nActivity Log: Record your daily exercise. You may notice that on the days you exercise you eat really well and the days you don\\'t, your nutrition is very poor.\\n\\nGoal setting: We like to encourage setting and reassessing goals on a daily basis. Everyday decide what your goal for the day will be - drink 8 glasses of water, eat 5 vegetable servings, consume 5 small meals...Pick an area that you need to focus on and then stick to it for the entire day. At the end of the day reassess your goal. Did you achieve it? Yes - Congratulations! No - Why not? What can you do tomorrow to ensure you are successful?\\n\\nDaily gratification: Include a section to record at least one thing that happened or something you saw on that day that you’re grateful for.\\n\\nWeekly Summary: At the end of the week, calculate how you did in all the important areas.\\n\\n73\\n\\nDaily Activity and Nutrition Log\\n\\nName: __________________________________________________ Date:_____________________\\n\\nExercise:\\n\\nCARDIO-VASCULAR\\n\\nMUSCLE-CONDITIONING\\n\\nFLEXIBILITY\\n\\nTime:\\n\\nTime:\\n\\nIntensity:\\n\\nIntensity:\\n\\nType:\\n\\nNutrition:\\n\\nBreakfast\\n\\nMid-morning\\n\\nLunch\\n\\nMid-afternoon\\n\\nDinner\\n\\nsnack\\n\\nsnack\\n\\nTime:\\n\\nTime:\\n\\nTime:\\n\\nTime:\\n\\nTime:\\n\\nWhat:\\n\\nWhat:\\n\\nWhat:\\n\\nWhat:\\n\\nWhat:\\n\\nLocation/\\n\\nLocation/\\n\\nLocation/\\n\\nLocation/\\n\\nLocation/\\n\\nEnvironment:\\n\\nEnvironment:\\n\\nEnvironment:\\n\\nEnvironment:\\n\\nEnvironment:\\n\\nFeelings:\\n\\nFeelings:\\n\\nFeelings:\\n\\nFeelings:\\n\\nFeelings:\\n\\nEstimated calories:\\n\\nEstimated calories:\\n\\nEstimated calories:\\n\\nEstimated calories:\\n\\nEstimated calories:\\n\\nEstimated Total Daily Calories:____________\\n\\nDid you drink 10 glasses of water today?\\n\\nYES NO\\n\\nHow many?

So how can one mere book possibly give you all of that?\\n\\nBecause this book is unlike any other fitness book ever created. Because no matter who you are, what you want, or where you happen to be standing right at this moment, the world’s greatest workout—the greatest workout for you—is now at your fingertips.\\n\\nYou see, just walking into a gym doesn’t guarantee you a great workout. It’s a lot like walking into a supermarket. Just because you fill your shopping cart with lots of great food doesn’t mean you know how to whip up a great meal. Cook all of those foods too fast, too long, or in the wrong combinations and even the freshest, most expensive\\n\\ningredients turn into slop.\\n\\nThe same thing happens in the gym: There are dozens of\\n\\nshiny machines and piles of free weights, and literally thousands of things you can do with them to build muscle and burn fat. But simply having access to a lot of equipment doesn’t mean you’ll know how to craft a great workout—one that will maximize your gains and minimize the time you spend reaching them.\\n\\nIf you’ve ever been frustrated by fitness plans in the past—or found yourself dropping out because of a lack of results, a lack of time, or because your routine called for equipment that wasn’t available on a regular basis, this book is for you. If you want to see progress immediately and feel yourself getting stronger and leaner by the day, this book is for you. If you want to take the gains you’ve reached and turbocharge them, this book is for you. If you want the perfect workout for the time you have, the equipment you have, and the goals you have, this book is for you.\\n\\nAnd most important: If you want total confidence that\\n\\nthe workout you’re doing is the absolute best possible workout, bar none, this book is for you.\\n\\nUnlike other exercise books that give you unyielding\\n\\nsystems incapable of adapting to time or equipment constraints, or that simply list hundreds of exercises but don’t tell you how to meld them into a cohesive workout, this book is different. Like a Swiss Army knife, it’s a multifaceted tool that adapts to provide you with the results you want, no matter the circumstances.\\n\\nAs the editorial director of Men’s Fitness, and the health\\n\\nand wellness editor of ABC News, I’ve tried just about every exercise plan ever created. I’ve lifted fast, I’ve lifted slow; I’ve lifted heavy, I’ve lifted light; I’ve run marathons and I’ve done wind sprints. (Although I have not, and will not, Zumba.) And I’ve spent more than 20 years reading studies and theories on building muscle, burning fat, and boosting endurance.\\n\\nBut what makes me excited about this book—what makes it so different from other exercise guides on the market—is that it guarantees you the absolute best workout no matter where you find yourself, what your goals are, or what equipment you have.\\n\\nWant the ultimate full-body fat-burning workout for the\\n\\ngym? It’s in here.\\n\\nWant the absolute best upper-body workout but have\\n\\naccess only to a pair of dumbbells? You’re covered.\\n\\nWant to shred your abs but have nothing but a pair of\\n\\ncross-trainers and a jogging trail? You’ve got the plan. Want to build muscle even while you’re trapped in a motel room or the world’s lamest hotel gym? This book takes every circumstance into consideration and gives you only the best.\\n\\nI know how good the workouts are in here because I know the team that built them: Sean Hyson, C.S.C.S., has been designing and editing workouts for the readers of Men’s Fitness and Muscle & Fitness for more than 10 years; he may well be the most knowledgeable fitness editor in the business. And I know how good the workouts are because I’ve done them myself—and they have kicked my ass. I’ve been astounded by the results!\\n\\nNow it’s time for you to build muscle, burn fat, and get into the greatest shape of your life in record time—all the while knowing that no matter where you are, no matter what equipment you have, the workout you’re doing is the absolute best workout for you, with the absolute maximum return on investment.\\n\\nGet ready to start winning.\\n\\nDavid Zinczenko\\n\\nIntroduction\\n\\nBe your best, wherever, whenever If you’re reading this book, you already appreciate the importance of working out. You know that without a regular training routine you’re not going to be your best— and let’s face it, being successful at this thing called life means constant striving to become the best you can be.\\n\\nOf course, when it comes to training—like most\\n\\neverything else in life—sometimes circumstances seem to conspire to keep you from working out. Maybe you’ll find yourself on the road without access to a gym or with access to only a really lame one. Or you might be in a situation where the only training equipment at your disposal is a TRX system, bands, or even less. Or maybe you have all the equipment you need but could use a different routine—one that shakes your body out of the complacency that results from sticking with a good thing for too long. You want to be your best, but sometimes that means making the best of a bad situation. Now, thanks to this book, you can always get a great workout—no matter where you are.\\n\\nConsider this a kind of Rosetta stone for training. No matter what kind of equipment you have (or lack thereof), or your degree of training experience, we’ve got a workout for you. In fact, we’ve got 101 of them. Your surroundings will never limit your routine again, with routines for\\n\\nbarbells, dumbbells, and even just one dumbbell. You’ll find routines that utilize suspension trainers, exercise bands, medicine balls, Swiss balls, or nothing but your body weight alone. And you’ll get to handpick from workouts that target the whole body or a program that focuses on body parts individually, along with specific workouts for the upper body and lower body. Plus, we’ve included routines for every cardio machine imaginable.\\n\\nWith this book, the coast is clear for you to get bigger, stronger, and leaner than ever, sculpting the body you’ve always wanted, regardless of your resources.\\n\\nNow, like most everything, this book has an upside and a downside. On the upside, you now have a resource that covers all your workout needs under every conceivable circumstance. The question “What kind of workout should I do?” has been answered forever. On the downside, you have no more excuses. You can’t skip sessions because you’re on the road and your hotel has a crappy, antiquated, little gym or no gym at all. Hell, you don’t even have an excuse to skip a workout if you’re lost in the arctic tundra (see this page)! You also can no longer say that you don’t have time to train, because some of these workouts require less time than an average water-cooler conversation (there’s a dedicated section of short workouts ranging from 30 minutes down to only four). This body-carving tome will fast-track your gains and\\n\\nteach you how to upgrade your current routine easily, with an incredible array of body-challenging routines. One hundred one options is a surefire plateau buster.\\n\\nNearly as diverse as the workouts within these pages are\\n\\nthe fitness experts we’ve recruited to design them, providing you with a wealth of authoritative information that has stood the test of thousands of training clients. Yet because training is only half the equation of physique transformation, we’ve also got your nutrition needs covered. Our newly erected Men’s Fitness Food Pyramid provides you with a foundation for building muscle while losing fat, employing the simplest calculations and menu plan.\\n\\nSo, as of right now, you officially have no more\\n\\nlimitations to your training—at least when it comes to location, time, and equipment. And, for better or worse, that also means no more excuses. With this book, the world becomes your gym—one that’s open 24/7, 365 days —with everything you need to build loads of quality muscle. Take advantage of your membership today and you’re guaranteed to look and feel your best for a lifetime to come.\\n\\n01 THE MEN’S FITNESS FOOD PYRAMID\\n\\nRemember the USDA Food Pyramid? The one that was posted by the lunch line in your grade school cafeteria and taught in health class? The government’s official position on how you should eat to be fit and healthy included recommendations to consume up to 11 servings of pasta, bread, and crackers per day; limit meat and eggs to three servings; and count potatoes as a vegetable.\\n\\nYeah, don’t eat like that.\\n\\nThe Food Pyramid was so misleading and inaccurate that in 2011 it was replaced with the USDA’s MyPlate, an improved but still flawed approach to fighting obesity. To be fair, the government’s nutrition advice is aimed at the average American who desires to be in only average shape (read: not obese). As we assume you picked up this book to be bigger, stronger, more ripped, and healthier than that, you need an entirely different approach.\\n\\nTo that end, we’ve created the Men’s Fitness Food Pyramid—an easy visual guide to eating for physique enhancement, performance, and optimal health. See how the pyramid works below and then use it to build a better body.\\n\\nHIT YOUR NUMBERS\\n\\nAs a physique-conscious eater, you need to think in terms of macronutrients as well as calories. Every food you eat gets counted toward a total target amount (in grams) of protein, carbs, and fat, which you can determine by multiplying the numbers in the Men’s Fitness Food Pyramid by your body weight in pounds. Hit these numbers and you’ll hit your goals.\\n\\nWith that said, your nutrition doesn’t need to be as\\n\\nprecise as target coordinates for a missile attack. You’ll do just fine eyeballing portions of protein, carbs, and fat (which we’ll show you how to do) and keeping a general tally.\\n\\nMAKE ADJUSTMENTS AS NECESSARY\\n\\nThe calorie and macronutrient recommendations here are just a starting point. Every trainee needs to find the proper amounts for his own body. If you’re not losing weight, reduce your carbs gradually, and try experimenting with bumping up your protein and fat intake a bit. If you feel as if you can’t gain weight, you can add more carbs and even more fat, which will increase your calories sharply.

To make size gains, you need at least one gram of protein per pound of your body weight to support optimal growth. When dieting, you must create a caloric deficit—but that can cause muscle loss if you end up cutting protein to do it. That’s why we increase protein intake and decrease starchy carbs. To get lean, you may increase your protein to as many as 1.5 grams per pound of body weight; but start lower and increase gradually as you reduce your calories slowly. If you feel like you’re not recovering from training or you’re losing muscle, up the protein fast.\\n\\nThe best protein sources are eggs, chicken, fish, lean beef, turkey, quinoa (for vegetarians), and protein powder. A three-ounce portion of lean meat or fish is about the size and thickness of the palm of your hand and contains 20–25 grams of protein, five grams of fat or fewer, and zero carbs.\\n\\nCARBS\\n\\nAll carbohydrates break down into glucose, raising your blood sugar levels faster than any other nutrient. As a result, the pancreas releases insulin to remove surplus sugar from the bloodstream and maintain normal levels. Research, including a study at the University of Washington School of Medicine, has found that exercise— particularly strength training—increases insulin sensitivity in the muscles. So if you’ve just worked out, more of the\\n\\ncarbs you eat afterward will be carried by insulin directly to your muscles for replenishment. (Incidentally, this goes for protein too, which is why it’s helpful to consume a mixture of protein and carbs after training—we’ll discuss this more later.) On the other hand, if you’ve been sitting on the couch watching football, those carbs will just get stored around your waist.\\n\\nFor this reason, we recommend that most of your carbs\\n\\ncome before, during, and shortly after training. It also means that you need to eat fewer carbs when you want to get lean—you need to keep insulin levels low. “If someone is in fat-loss mode,” says John Meadows, C.S.S.N., a nutrition coach and national-level bodybuilder, “I like to limit carbs to pre-, intra-, and post-workout meals, when they’ll go where you want them”—that is, to muscle tissue. For muscle gain, Meadows prefers to add carbs (shakes included) to meals around training time first, before adding them to other meals.\\n\\nCarb foods include potatoes, sweet potatoes, rice, oats, fruits, and vegetables. Fruits should be consumed in their whole-food form and limited to two or three pieces daily (excess fructose, the sugar in fruit, is stored as fat). Green vegetables can be eaten steadily regardless of the goal. Eat one gram of carbohydrate per pound of your body weight when dieting and two grams per pound when you want to put on muscle.\\n\\nA fist-size portion of cooked rice or potatoes is about\\n\\none cup and gives you 40–45 grams of carbs and negligible protein and fat.\\n\\nFAT\\n\\n“We need to provide a baseline level of good fats for hormone production,” says Nate Miyaki, C.S.S.N., a nutrition consultant and bodybuilder in San Francisco, CA. Fat, particularly the much-maligned saturated kind, helps in the creation of testosterone, which does everything from getting you big and lean to keeping your “little friend” ready to say hello. Contrary to popular opinion, when dieting, you don’t need to drop your fat intake much, if at all; fat loss comes fastest when carbohydrate intake is reduced. Plus, fat is satiating as well as a good source of energy.\\n\\nMost of your fats should come by way of your protein foods, but avocados, nuts, seeds, and a small amount of oil like coconut and olive oil can be included as well. Aim for 0.4 grams per pound of your body weight daily to start. One tablespoon of any oil is about 15 grams of fat, and one cup of almonds or peanuts has 70 grams of fat. Two tablespoons of nut butter is about the length of your thumb and contains 15–20 grams of fat.\\n\\nWORKOUT NUTRITION\\n\\nResearch hasn’t yet clarified the optimal amount of protein or carbs you should eat around workouts for the maximum benefit. But it is clear that some is better than none, and the presence of both is crucial. A 2006 study in the European Journal of Applied Physiology gave male subjects one of the following to consume after weight training: a 6 percent carbohydrate solution, six grams of\\n\\namino acids (components of protein), a combination of both, or a placebo. Those drinking the carb-and-aminos shake experienced greater muscle gains than any of the other groups, which the researchers presumed was because the concoction did the most to reduce muscle protein breakdown after training.\\n\\nMeadows recommends taking in 25–50 grams of\\n\\nprotein, 25–35 grams of carbs, and 10 grams of fat before training. Afterward, consume another 20–40 grams of protein and 40–80 grams of carbs—you can begin chugging this shake during the workout as well to limit muscle breakdown even further, though this may not be necessary and could upset your stomach. We like to make shakes with whey isolate or hydrolysate as the protein source, and Vitargo or highly branched cyclic dextrin for carbs.\\n\\nIf powders and shakes aren’t in your budget, Miyaki says you can go old-school and eat fruit pre- and post-workout. One or two pieces should provide enough carbs to halt muscle breakdown. And a lean three-ounce slice of protein to accompany it is fine.\\n\\nA PERFECT DAY How to plan your eating to achieve your goals\\n\\nLet’s say you’re a\\n\\n180 POUND MAN who wants to lose his gut.\\n\\nYou could start your diet eating about\\n\\n2,100 CALORIES DAILY (180 × 12)\\n\\nconsisting of 180g PROTEIN, 180g CARBS, and 70g FAT.\\n\\nHERE’S A LOW-STRESS EATING PLAN TO FIT THIS GUY’S BUSY SCHEDULE.\\n\\nBREAKFAST\\n\\n8 oz black coffee\\n\\n3 scrambled eggs\\n\\n1/3 cup unsweetened oatmeal with cinnamon\\n\\nPOST-WORKOUT\\n\\n25g whey protein\\n\\n1 banana\\n\\nLUNCH\\n\\n3 oz grilled salmon\\n\\nLarge raw salad w/ 2 tbsp olive oil and vinegar 1 cup sweet potato or white potato (cooked)\\n\\nDINNER\\n\\n6 oz baked chicken breast\\n\\n1 cup jasmine rice or potato (cooked)\\n\\nSteamed broccoli\\n\\nSNACK\\n\\nMeal-replacement shake with 50g protein, 25g carbs, 5g fat\\n\\nDESSERT\\n\\n2 tbsp almond butter mixed with one scoop chocolate casein protein and water (to make a pudding)\\n\\n02 HOW TO WARM UP\\n\\nWe’ll keep this brief. When you’re eager to work out, the last thing you want to do is slow your roll with a long warmup that has you flopping around the floor like a fish, draining your momentum. If you passed fifth grade P.E., you’ve already had it drilled into you that warming up is crucial and not to be skipped, so we’ll spare you the speech about howimportant it is. Instead of lecturing, we’ll give you some warmup options that get you sweating and ready to perform any of the workouts that follow, but also fit into the time you have and your level of patience—whatever the case may be. Most important is that you don’t start lifting heavy weights, jumping, or running totally cold, which common sense should tell you is an injury waiting to happen.\\n\\nOPTION 1 THE BEST WARMUP\\n\\nIf you have at least an hour in which to train, or a history of injuries that could otherwise impede your ability to train safely, your warmup should begin with foam rolling and include a wide array of dynamic exercises and static stretches.\\n\\nIf you’ve tried a foam roller after a tough workout, you were instantly aware of its ability to help relieve muscle aches and soreness. It also provides an easy way to start getting warmed up, as it promotes blood flow. Rest your muscles on the roller (a tennis ball, softball, or lacrosse ball work, too) and roll them out for about 30 seconds each. When you find a tender spot, hold the position until you feel it begin to release (or for as long as you can stand it). Pay extra attention to the hips, glutes, outer and inner thighs, lower back, calves, and lats. You can repeat the rolling after your workout as well if you like, as this may enhance recovery.\\n\\nA)\\n\\nB) fuzzy). This could be a set of 30 jumping jacks, a five- minute walk on the treadmill (set to a slight incline), or a\\n\\nPerform some light activity that elevates your heart rate and makes you feel warm (though not necessarily\\n\\nminute or two of jumping rope. Other cardio machines like a stationary bike or an elliptical machine can also get your blood flowing.\\n\\nNow you’ll begin what’s often called a dynamic C) warmup. In addition to encouraging further blood flow and higher body temperature, dynamic exercises take your muscles through the ranges of motion you’ll use in your workout, preparing you to get into those positions safely. There are endless options, but try this routine.\\n\\n1 SHOULDER OVER AND BACK\\n\\nPERFORM 15 REPS\\n\\nHold a band, dowel, yardstick, or light bar in front of your hips with hands outside shoulder width. Keeping your elbows straight, raise your arms overhead and behind your body as far as you can. Bring them back in front of you again. Continue going over and back and gradually narrow your grip as you feel your shoulders loosen up.\\n\\n2 HIP HINGE\\n\\nPERFORM 15 REPS\\n\\nPlace your hands on your hips and stand with feet hip width. Push your hips back, bending your knees only as needed, until you feel a stretch in your hamstrings. Squeeze your glutes as you forcefully push your hips forward again to stand up straight.\\n\\n3 OVERHEAD SQUAT\\n\\nPERFORM 10 REPS\\n\\nHold a band, dowel, yardstick, or light bar overhead with hands outside shoulder width. Stand with feet shoulder width and toes turned out slightly. Bend your hips back and squat as low as you can without letting your tailbone tuck under. Keep the object you’re holding above and slightly behind your head the whole time—don’t let it drift in front of you.\\n\\n4 SIDE LUNGE\\n\\nPERFORM 10 REPS ON EA CH LEG\\n\\nStand with feet hip width and step out to your left. Lower your body until your left knee is bent 90 degrees, or until you feel a stretch in the right side of your groin, but keep your right leg straight. Repeat on the right side.\\n\\n5 BENTOVER YTW\\n\\nPERFORM 8 REPS OF EA CH\\n\\nStand with feet shoulder width and bend your hips back, keeping your lower back flat, until your torso is about 45 degrees to the floor. Let your arms hang. Now squeeze your shoulder blades together and raise your arms up and out to your sides about 45 degrees to form a Y shape. Lower them and then raise them out to your sides 90 degrees to form a T. Lower and then raise them out to your sides, but bend your elbows 90 degrees to form a W.\\n\\n6 CAT/CAMEL\\n\\nPERFORM 10 REPS\\n\\nKneel on the floor with knees under your hips and hands beneath your shoulders. Arch your back so your chest rises—you should look like a cat stretching. Now round your entire back so it looks like a camel’s hump.\\n\\n7 BIRD DOG\\n\\nPERFORM 10 REPS ON EA CH SIDE\\n\\nFrom the kneeling position, extend your left hand out in front of you. Simultaneously kick your right leg back straight, bracing your core and squeezing your glutes as you do so. Hold for a moment and then switch legs.\\n\\n8 HIP CIRCLE\\n\\nMA KE 10 CLOCKWISE CIRCLES A ND THEN SWITCH LEGS; REPEA T ON BOTH LEGS IN THE COUNTERCLOCKWISE DIRECTION\\n\\nFrom the kneeling position, raise your right knee off the floor and make circles with it, opening your hip as much as possible on each revolution. Keep your shoulders square to the floor.\\n\\n9 GROINER\\n\\nPERFORM 10 REPS ON EA CH SIDE\\n\\nGet into pushup position with your hands shoulder width, feet close together, and body in a straight line. Jump your left foot forward and land it to the outside of your left hand. Let your hips sink a bit to feel the stretch and then reverse it—jump your left foot back while the right one comes up to your right hand.\\n\\nD)At this point, it’s wise to statically stretch muscles\\n\\nthat you know to be chronically tight. For most\\n\\npeople, the hips, glutes, and lats are bound up due to many hours sitting at desks in front of computers, but stretch whatever areas you feel need it most. Hold each stretch for 30 seconds and repeat for three sets on each side. The following are some suggestions.\\n\\nHIP FLEXOR STRETCH\\n\\nGet into lunge position on the floor with your right leg back. Place your hands on your hips and push your hips forward until you feel a stretch in your right hip. Squeeze your glutes on your right side. For a more intense stretch, reach your right arm overhead and lean back slightly while keeping your hips forward. Another progression is to reach back and grasp the outside of your rear foot and gently pull it off the floor. You’ll feel the stretch go into the top of your thigh.\\n\\nLAT STRETCH\\n\\nGrasp a sturdy upright object with your left hand, thumb facing up, and bend your hips back until your torso and arm are in line and you feel a stretch in your lat. Move gently from side to side so you stretch the entire muscle.\\n\\nPEC STRETCH\\n\\nPlace the meat of your right forearm against a sturdy upright object (a doorframe is perfect) and bend your elbow 90 degrees. Gently lean forward so you feel a stretch on your pec.\\n\\nPIRIFORMIS STRETCH\\n\\nSit on a bench and cross your left leg over your right knee, bending your left knee 90 degrees. Gently push your left knee down so you feel a stretch on the outside of your left glutes.\\n\\nCALF STRETCH\\n\\nPlace your hands against a wall and stagger your feet so one is close to the wall and your rear leg is straight. Both feet face forward and your rear leg should be aligned with your upper body. Lean forward until you feel your calf stretch on your trailing leg.\\n\\nOPTION 2 THE MEATHEAD’S WARMUP\\n\\nMost guys come into the gym and grasp the bar or a pair of dumbbells and do a light set of 15–20 reps. Then they go a little heavier and cut the reps down a bit. They’ll do one more set and, now that they’re sweating, figure they’re ready to go.\\n\\nWhile this is hardly the best way to prep your body, it does serve the purpose most of the time, assuming you’re not training too heavy. But take it a little slower and more deliberately, and you’ve got a more decent warmup routine for when you’re doing one of our lifting workouts and need to get done in a hurry.\\n\\nHere’s how to warm up for a heavy strength workout that begins with a barbell exercise. More accurately, this is called “working up” in powerlifting circles, because the goal is to gradually work your way up to using the heaviest weights possible. You start with the empty bar and perform 10–15 reps with perfect form and then add weight in moderate increments until you’re at the maximum load you plan to lift on the exercise.\\n\\nHere’s how it might look for a guy work ing up to a 275-pound squat\\n\\nfor fiv e reps:\\n\\nThere’s no exact formula for how to do this, so the weights and reps above aren’t mandatory, but the idea is to start very light, pump some blood into the working muscles and lubricate the joints, and then add weight steadily until you comfortably arrive at the heaviest load you can use for the target reps. The reps on these work-up sets are kept low (after the first set or two) because you need to conserve energy for the main effort, the work set. These sets also serve to reinforce good technique, so the form on the exercise is fresh in your mind and the body is in its groove to do it properly when you get to a challenging load.\\n\\nHow long should you rest between sets? Since work-up sets aren’t as taxing as your main work sets, you shouldn’t need to rest long. A minute or so will be fine for most until you get up to heavy weights, at which time you can rest longer.\\n\\nThere are a few tricks you can employ to make this process even more effective and make your top set even heavier, or at least feel easier. Try doing your last work-up set a little heavier than the main set, but only for one or two reps, so it’s not too strenuous. Then back down to the weight you intend to use for the work set.\\n\\nFor instance, if y ou’re going to perform a squat with 275 for fiv e, y our last four sets could look lik e this:\\n\\nIn other words, you gradually work up to an even heavier weight, reducing your reps to minimize fatigue, and then go back down to 275. The set with 300 might be way more than you can handle for five reps, but done for only one, it will feel relatively easy. By comparison, 275 will feel much easier when it’s done afterward. Obviously, this won’t work on super-heavy sets when your target reps are in the 1–3 range, but it’s great when they’re between 4 and 8.\\n\\nAnother trick, which we learned from Jason Ferruggia, a\\n\\nstrength coach in Los Angeles, CA, is to back the weight down for a set before you reach your target. This works well if you’re trying to hit a new max (one rep), which can be very intimidating. The weight tends to feel very heavy at around 90 percent of your max, and it can dissuade you from going any heavier. By going a bit lighter for a set and then working your way back up, you give your nervous system more time to adapt. The weight feels lighter, so you feel more confident, and the rest of the way up to your max weight goes smoother.\\n\\nSay y ou’re try ing to bench press 315 for the first time. Your last few sets could dev elop lik e this:\\n\\nTo be clear, working up is not optional. Because it can be time consuming, if you have time for only one kind of warmup, this should be it. But we strongly suggest that, whenever possible, you employ one of the other options we list here beforehand.\\n\\nIncidentally, working up applies to training with\\n\\nkettlebells/dumbbells, a suspension trainer, and bands as well. Start with light resistance, gradually tapering your reps as you up the intensity.\\n\\nOPTION 3 THE PRACTICAL WARMUP\\n\\nAs the name implies, this routine is for when you have time to warm up, but not enough to do everything listed in Option 1. In this case, you need to get a good sweat going and prepare your muscles and joints to move while doing the bare essentials.\\n\\nAccording to Ben Bruno, a celebrity trainer at Rise Movement in West Hollywood, CA, you should hit a cardio machine for five minutes followed by these stretches. “Do toe-touch squats and sumo squat holds (both of which are explained below) to improve mobility,” Bruno says.\\n\\nTOE-TOUCH SQUAT\\n\\nStand with feet shoulder width and toes turned slightly out. Reach down to touch your toes with legs extended and then bend your hips back to squat down, keeping your lower back in its natural arch. Now reach your hands overhead and come up.\\n\\nSUMO SQUAT HOLD\\n\\nStand with feet shoulder width and toes turned slightly out. Bend your hips back and squat down, keeping your lower back flat and reaching your hands to your toes in the bottom position. Hold the position for a few seconds and then use your elbows to push your knees farther apart so you can sink deeper into the squat.\\n\\nDID WE SAY THIS WOULD BE BRIEF?\\n\\nIn a nutshell, that’s all you need to know about warming up. Note that even if you’re doing a lower-body workout, it’s smart to include some upper-body warmup moves because the entire body is connected. Tightness or coldness in the upper torso can lead to injury when working the legs, and vice versa; so while you may abbreviate or recombine the warmup moves listed here, don’t ignore whole muscle areas just because you’re not training them that day. For the cardio routines beginning in chapter 26, you don’t need to do any more warming up than what is already built into the workouts.\\n\\n03 FULL GYM\\n\\nWe all love to bitch about our gyms. They don’t have enough benches, the machines are always broken, and so on. It’s only when we’re forced to train at home or in a hotel that we realize what a luxury even the most average commercial fitness center is.\\n\\nIf you’re lucky enough to have a membership to a training facility, this chapter is for you. Or, if you’ve put together a well-stocked home gym, this is where you should start as well. While it may not be the fitness paradise you crave, it almost certainly has all the tools you need to build a great body. The workouts that follow will show you how to take advantage of them.\\n\\nWe’re assuming your gym has barbells, dumbbells, a powerrack, adjustable benches, cables, Swiss balls, and pullup bars. With that much inventory, you can easily complete the various options of workouts we outline for you. These include three distinct routines for gaining muscle, two for losing fat, and two for body recomposition —workouts that hit the magical combination of both muscle gain and fat loss to reshape your physique with minimal change in body weight.\\n\\nTHE BEST BODY- RECOMPOSITION WORKOUT [option A] WORKOUT #1 BY JOE DOWDELL, C.S.C.S.\\n\\nWe can’t ov erstate the aw esomeness of G erman engineering. The\\n\\nland that brought us jet planes, the M ercedes, and H eidi Klum also\\n\\nintroduced perhaps the best method of body recomposition know n to the\\n\\nfitness industry —that is, a timeless strategy to gain muscle and lose body fat\\n\\nsimultaneously . A chtung!\\n\\nHOW IT WORKS\\n\\nH ala Rambie, a scientist w ho defected to West G ermany during the C old War,\\n\\nfound that fat loss could be accelerated by raising lev els of blood lactate—an\\n\\nenergy substrate. M ore lactate corresponds to greater release of grow th\\n\\nhormone, w hich tells y our body to grow muscle and burn flab.\\n\\nThe best way to raise lactate quickly is to pair upper- and lower-body exercises, or opposing movements, for reps in the 8–15 range. The sweet spot for sets is three, and rest periods are restricted to 30–60 seconds. This approach has since become known as German Body Comp.\\n\\nDIRECTIONS\\n\\nA lternate sets of “A ” and “B” exercises. S o y ou’ll do a set of A , rest, then a\\n\\nset of B, rest again, and so on for all the prescribed sets. The remaining\\n\\nexercises are done as straight sets.\\n\\nTo increase the intensity, decrease your rest between sets by 15 seconds every two weeks. Start by resting 60 seconds for the first two weeks. Then in Weeks 3 and 4, rest 45 seconds, and so on.\\n\\nTEMPO\\n\\nE ach exercise is assigned a tempo.\\n\\n(A “0” indicates no time—simply mov e on to the next digit.) F or example, a\\n\\nfront squat w ith a tempo of 3110 w ould be done like so: Take three seconds\\n\\nto low er y ourself into the squat. P ause for one second at the bottom.

Bend your hips back to reach down and grasp the bar, hands just outside your knees. Keeping your lower back in its natural arch, drive your heels into the floor and pull the bar up along your shins until you’re standing with hips fully extended and the bar is in front of your thighs.\\n\\n1B 1¼ NEUTRAL-GRIP DUMBBELL BENCH PRESS\\n\\nSETS: 3 REPS: 8–10 TEMPO: 3020 REST: 60 SEC.\\n\\nLie back on a flat bench with a dumbbell in each hand. Turn your wrists so your palms face each other. Press the weights over your chest and then lower back down. Come back up one quarter of the way, and then down again. Now press up to lockout once more. That’s one rep. Take three seconds to lower the weights down from the lockout position, and two seconds when pressing to lockout.\\n\\n2A BULGARIAN SPLIT SQUAT\\n\\nSETS: 3 REPS: 8–10 (EA CH SIDE) TEMPO: 3110 REST: 60 SEC.\\n\\nStand lunge-length in front of a bench. Hold a dumbbell in each hand and rest the top of your left foot on the bench behind you. Lower your body until your rear knee nearly touches the floor and your front thigh is parallel to the floor.\\n\\n2B INVERTED ROW\\n\\nSETS: 3 REPS: 10–12 TEMPO: 2011 REST: 60 SEC.\\n\\nSet a barbell in a power rack (or use a Smith machine) at about hip height. Lie underneath it and grasp it with hands about shoulder-width apart. Hang from the bar so your body forms a straight line. Squeeze your shoulder blades together and pull yourself up until your back is fully contracted.\\n\\n3A DIP\\n\\nSETS: 3 REPS: 10–12 TEMPO: 3110 REST: 60 SEC.\\n\\nSuspend yourself over the bars of a dip station and lower your body until your upper arms are parallel to the floor.\\n\\n3B SEATED INCLINE DUMBBELL CURL\\n\\nSETS: 3 REPS: 10–12 TEMPO: 4010 REST: 60 SEC.\\n\\nSet an adjustable bench between 45 and 60 degrees and sit back against it with a dumbbell in each hand. Curl the weights to shoulder height without allowing your elbows to drift in front of your shoulders.\\n\\n4 SWISS BALL ROLLOUT\\n\\nSETS: 3 REPS: 10–15 TEMPO: 2020 REST: 60 SEC.\\n\\nKneel on the floor and rest your forearms on a Swiss ball. Keeping your core braced, roll the ball forward so your arms are extended. Stop before your lower back begins to sag. Roll yourself back.\\n\\nTHE BEST BODY- RECOMPOSITION WORKOUT [option B] WORKOUT #2 BY JOE DOWDELL, C.S.C.S.\\n\\nU se this routine just as y ou did the prev ious one—Body -\\n\\nRecomposition O ption A .

Grasp the bar with hands at shoulder width and raise your elbows until your upper arms are parallel to the floor. Take the bar out of the rack and let it rest on your fingertips—as long as your elbows stay up, you’ll be able to balance the bar. Step back and set your feet at shoulder width with toes turned out slightly. Squat as low as you can without losing the arch in your lower back.\\n\\n1B NEUTRAL-GRIP CHINUP\\n\\nSETS: 3 REPS: 8–10 TEMPO: 4010 REST: 60 SEC.\\n\\nUse a chinup bar that has handles so you can grasp it with your palms facing each other (if you have only a straight bar, hook a V-grip cable handle over it, or use a suspension trainer as shown). Hang from the handles and then pull yourself up until your chin is over them.\\n\\n2A ROMANIAN DEADLIFT\\n\\nSETS: 3 REPS: 8–10 TEMPO: 3110 REST: 60 SEC.\\n\\nHold a barbell with a shoulder-width grip and stand with feet hip width.

If you choose to repeat the workout, vary the sets and reps you perform on these last four exercises each session. This will help you to continue milking gains from the circuit for months on end. Rotate between 3 sets of 10 reps, 4 sets of 5 reps, and 2 sets of 15 reps.\\n\\n1 SWISS BALL PLANK CIRCLE\\n\\nSETS: 2 REPS: 30–45 SECONDS (EA CH DIRECTION) REST: 60–90 SEC.\\n\\nPlace a Swiss ball on the floor and get into pushup position with your hands on it.

Now explosively extend your hips as if jumping while at the same time shrugging your shoulders and pulling the bar straight up in front of your torso. As the bar reaches chest level, bend your elbows so that your palms face the ceiling and catch the bar at shoulder level, upper arms parallel to the floor. Bend your hips and knees as you catch the bar to absorb the impact and then stand up straight.\\n\\n2D PUSH PRESS\\n\\nSETS: 3–5 REPS: 6 REST: 90 SEC.\\n\\nHold the bar at shoulder level. Dip your knees to gather momentum and then extend them explosively to press the weight overhead.\\n\\n3A SQUAT\\n\\nSETS: 4 REPS: 5 REST: 0 SEC.\\n\\nSet up in a squat rack or cage. Grasp the bar as far apart as is comfortable and step under it. Squeeze your shoulder blades together and nudge the bar out of the rack. Step back and stand with your feet shoulder width and your toes turned slightly outward. Take a deep breath and bend your hips back and then bend your knees to lower your body as far as you can without losing the arch in your lower back. Push your knees outward as you descend.

Hang from the bar and then pull yourself up until your chin is over it.\\n\\n04 BARBELL\\n\\nBecause of its association with bench pressing, squatting, and deadlifting, the barbell tends to be thought of as a tool that’s good only for performing specific lifts or hitting one muscle group at a time. In later chapters we’ll show you how to get great workouts for any body part with a barbell alone, but here we’ve got routines that work your whole body.\\n\\nYou don’t necessarily need a bench, a rack, or even two matched plates to get a good workout with a barbell. A corner of a room in which you can wedge one end can be enough. And if you use the Olympic lifts—the exercises contested in Olympic weightlifting competitions—you can hit every major muscle of the body in minutes. These are just two of the approaches you’re about to discover.\\n\\nTHE BEST BARBELL-ONLY WORKOUT [option A] WORKOUT #8 BY JOE STANKOWSKI, C.P.T.\\n\\nIf y ou train at home or any w here else that prov ides only a barbell\\n\\nand a small amount of w eight, y ou can make the most of it by\\n\\nspeeding or slow ing y our reps and performing y our exercises circuit-sty le.\\n\\nHOW IT WORKS\\n\\nThe barbell w as inv ented to carry balanced loads but w orks just as w ell out\\n\\nof balance. The follow ing exercises can be performed w ith one end w edged\\n\\nbetw een tw o w alls w hile y ou lift the other end like a lev er. You may find\\n\\nthat pressing the bar like a lev er feels less stressful to y our shoulders, plus it\\n\\nactiv ates y our core to a greater degree.\\n\\nDIRECTIONS\\n\\nP erform the exercises as a circuit, completing one set of each in turn w ithout\\n\\nrest. If an exercise feels easy using the load y ou hav e av ailable, perform\\n\\ny our reps slow er and w ith more control. (O r, if y ou hav e extra w eight, load\\n\\nit.) A nother option is to choke dow n on the bar. G ripping it low er w ill decrease\\n\\ny our mechanical adv antage and make the exercise harder.\\n\\nAfter the last exercise, rest two minutes and then repeat the entire circuit. Continue for 20 minutes. You\\n\\ncan repeat the workout up to four times per week, resting a day between sessions.\\n\\n1 SPLIT SQUAT TO PRESS\\n\\nREPS: 10–12 (EA CH SIDE) REST: 0 SEC.\\n\\nWedge the end of the barbell into a corner of the room (to avoid damage to the walls, you may have to wrap a towel around it). Load the opposite end with a weight plate and grasp it toward the end. Get into a lunge position with your left leg in front, bent to where your thigh is parallel to the floor and your right knee nearly touches the floor. Stand up explosively and press the bar straight up.\\n\\n2 SINGLE-ARM ROW W/ PARTIAL LUNGE\\n\\nREPS: 10–12 (EA CH SIDE) REST: 0 SEC.\\n\\nHold the barbell behind the sleeve (where you load the weights) with your left hand. Get into a lunge position but not deep—keep both legs slightly extended so that the bar and plate don’t brush the floor. Draw your shoulder blade back and row the bar to your ribs.\\n\\n3 BARBELL RUSSIAN TWIST\\n\\nREPS: 10–12 (EA CH SIDE) REST: 0 SEC.\\n\\nGrasp the bar near the very end again—this time with both hands. Stand with feet shoulder width. Swing the bar to your left, pivoting your feet as needed, and then swing to your right.\\n\\n4 LEVER FLOOR PRESS\\n\\nREPS: 10–12 (EA CH SIDE) REST: 120 SEC.\\n\\nLie on your back on the floor and grasp the end of the bar again behind the sleeve with your left hand. Hold it just above your shoulder and extend your right arm out to your side for support. Press the bar over your chest.\\n\\nTHE BEST BARBELL-ONLY WORKOUT [option B] WORKOUT #9 BY BRIAN GRASSO\\n\\nC all this one the “N o E xcuses Workout” because w e hav e y et to hear\\n\\na compelling reason w hy someone can’t succeed w ith it. F irst of all, it\\n\\ntakes only six minutes to complete. S econd, it requires just a barbell and a\\n\\npair of plates. Load the bar once and y ou’re ready to go. Think y ou can\\n\\nhandle that?\\n\\nHOW IT WORKS\\n\\nThe w orkout is a barbell complex—a series of exercises that flow . The finish\\n\\nposition of the hang clean sets y ou up perfectly for the front squat, w hich then\\n\\nallow s y ou to mov e right into the ov erhead press, and so on.\\n\\nChoose one weight, which will be determined by the exercise you can lift the least amount on (in this case, the overhead lunge), and go for it. The pace will be so intense that you’ll be grateful the workout is over in six minutes. Fortunately, your metabolism will remain accelerated for 48 hours afterward.\\n\\nDIRECTIONS\\n\\nP erform the exercises as a circuit, completing one set of each in turn w ithout\\n\\nrest.

Repeat for three total circuits.\\n\\nChoose a load you could use for 10 reps on a normal overhead press, and keep that same weight for all the exercises.\\n\\n1 ROMANIAN DEADLIFT\\n\\nREPS: 3 REST: 0 SEC.\\n\\nHold the bar at shoulder width and stand with feet hip width. Bend your hips back as far as you can. Allow your knees to bend as needed while you lower the bar along your shins until you feel a stretch in your hamstrings. Keep your lower back arched throughout. Squeeze your glutes as you come back up.\\n\\n2 HANG CLEAN\\n\\nREPS: 3 REST: 0 SEC.\\n\\nWith the bar in front of your thighs, bend your hips and knees so that the bar lowers to just above your knees. Now explosively extend your hips as if jumping while at the same time shrugging your shoulders and pulling the bar straight up in front of your torso. As the bar reaches chest level, bend your elbows so that your palms face the ceiling and catch the bar at shoulder level. Bend your hips and knees as you catch the bar to absorb the impact.\\n\\n3 FRONT SQUAT\\n\\nREPS: 3 REST: 0 SEC.\\n\\nFrom the catch position of the hang clean, squat as low as you can without losing the arch in your lower back.\\n\\n4 OVERHEAD PRESS\\n\\nREPS: 3 REST: 0 SEC.\\n\\nFrom standing, press the bar overhead, pushing your head forward and shrugging your traps as the bar passes your face.\\n\\n5 OVERHEAD LUNGE\\n\\nREPS: 3 (EA CH SIDE) REST: SEE DIRECTIONS\\n\\nHold the bar overhead and step forward with your left leg. Lower yourself until your left thigh is parallel to the floor and your rear knee nearly touches the floor.\\n\\n05 DUMBBELLS & KETTLEBELLS\\n\\nEver since the reemergence of the kettlebell as a training staple about a decade ago, there’s been a debate over which is superior, dumbbells or kettlebells. While this argument is pretty much a stalemate, we’ll take kettlebells.\\n\\nFor one, kettlebells have thicker handles, so your grip and forearms are recruited more heavily. For another, the bell hangs at a distance from the handle, so the load is offset, which makes every move more difficult to stabilize and more demanding of your core to provide that stability. Furthermore, just about any exercise you can think to do with a dumbbell can be replicated with a kettlebell and will feel much harder.\\n\\nBut, hey, people have been getting ripped sans kettlebells for years, so if dumbbells are all you have, forget what you read above. Dumbbells tend to take up less space and are a little more convenient to store, and they’re certainly more common and easy to find, so you might as well learn how to make the most of them. This chapter explores your options when training\\n\\nconditions are most dire—when you have access only to embarrassingly light weights, mismatched weights, or even just one weight. All the workouts that follow can be performed with either dumbbells or kettlebells. Or, a single bell, as the case may be.\\n\\nTHE BEST TWO- DUMBBELL/KETTLEBELL WORKOUT [option A] WORKOUT #10 BY JOE STANKOWSKI, C.P.T.\\n\\nWhether y ou’re v isiting relativ es or in a hotel w ith an underw helming\\n\\n“fitness center,” there may come a time w hen all y ou hav e access to\\n\\nis a measly pair of dumbbells or kettlebells. N ot a problem, now that y ou\\n\\nhav e this routine.\\n\\nHOW IT WORKS\\n\\nIn this situation, the load y ou hav e w ill be more appropriate for some\\n\\nexercises than others. To see that y ou get the most out of the w orkout w e\\n\\nprescribe here, w hatev er the poundage y ou hav e to w ork w ith, y ou’ll need to\\n\\nadjust the speed of y our reps. A pair of 25-pound dumbbells, for example,\\n\\nprobably w on’t be challenging on exercises such as the stepup. In this case,\\n\\nperform y our reps more slow ly to test y our endurance and build muscle\\n\\ncontrol. O n other exercises, like the bentov er lateral raise, 25 pounds may be\\n\\njust right or a bit heav y , so perform y our reps explosiv ely .\\n\\nIf you should happen to have two unevenly weighted dumbbells, such as a 25-pounder and a 15-pounder, don’t be discouraged. Simply switch the weights in your hands each time you repeat the circuit. Asymmetrical loads force\\n\\nyour core to stabilize you even more on each exercise.\\n\\nDIRECTIONS\\n\\nP erform the exercises as a circuit, completing one set of each in turn w ithout\\n\\nrest. A fter the last exercise, rest tw o minutes and then repeat. C ontinue for 20\\n\\nminutes. You can repeat the w orkout up to four times per w eek.\\n\\n1 SIDE PLANK W/ LATERAL RAISE\\n\\nSETS: A S MA NY A S POSSIBLE REPS: 10–12 (EA CH SIDE) REST: 0 SEC.\\n\\nLie on your left side resting your left forearm on the floor for support. Hold the dumbbell in your right hand. Raise your hips up so that your body forms a straight line and brace your abs—your weight should be on your left forearm and the edge of your left foot. From this position, raise the weight in your right hand until your arm is parallel to the floor. If the dumbbell or kettlebell you have is too heavy to perform a lateral raise with in this position, you can use a weight plate from the dumbbell (if it’s the plate-loaded kind), or simply skip the lateral raise and use the weight to resist your side plank.\\n\\n2 SINGLE-LEG ROMANIAN DEADLIFT\\n\\nSETS: A S MA NY A S POSSIBLE REPS: 10–12 (EA CH SIDE) REST: 0 SEC.\\n\\nHold a dumbbell in one hand and stand on the opposite leg.

MURPHY, M.F.S.\\n\\nA s trendy as kettlebells hav e become, many chain gy ms don’t offer\\n\\nenough that y ou can be sure y ou’ll get a matching pair at a giv en time\\n\\n(especially if that time is during peak hours). Your best bet then is to do w hat\\n\\ny ou can w ith a single kettlebell.\\n\\nIncidentally, if you train at home and have just one\\n\\ndumbbell that you’ve been using as a paperweight up until now, this workout applies equally to you (kettlebells and dumbbells can be used interchangeably).\\n\\nHOW IT WORKS\\n\\nO ne bell offers a distinct set of benefits from a pair. Your body w ill hav e to\\n\\ncompensate for the imbalance by recruiting y our core muscles more intensely ,\\n\\nand w orking one side at a time w ill make for longer sets w ith a greater\\n\\ncardiov ascular demand. Done as a circuit, the exercises that follow raise y our\\n\\nheart rate ev en further, making this w orkout a great adjunct to a strict diet for\\n\\nfat loss.\\n\\nDIRECTIONS\\n\\nThe w orkout consists of tw o circuits. In C ircuit 1, y ou’ll perform the exercises\\n\\nin sequence for six reps each. C omplete as many rounds as possible in six\\n\\nminutes, and then rest one minute. Repeat tw ice more and then rest tw o\\n\\nminutes before beginning C ircuit 2.\\n\\nCIRCUIT 1\\n\\n1 ONE-ARM SNATCH\\n\\nREPS: 6 (EA CH SIDE) REST: 0 SEC.\\n\\nHold a kettlebell in front of your thighs with your right hand and stand with feet between hip and shoulder width. Keep your torso as upright as possible and bend your knees until the weight hangs at mid-shin level— maintain the arch in your lower back. Jump, extending your hips explosively, and raise the weight straight up your body. When it gets to your chest, flip your wrist and “catch” the bell overhead with arm extended.\\n\\n2 KETTLEBELL PRESS-OUT\\n\\nREPS: 6 REST: 0 SEC.\\n\\nHold the weight close to your chest at shoulder level with both hands on the handle and palms facing each other. Squat down as deeply as you can and then press the bell straight out in front of you with arms extended. Bring it back to your chest and repeat for reps while maintaining the squat position.\\n\\n3 HARD-STYLE KETTLEBELL SWING\\n\\nREPS: 6 REST: 0 SEC.\\n\\nStand with feet hip-width apart and the weight on the floor. Grasp the kettlebell with both hands (palms facing you) and, keeping your lower back flat, extend your hips to raise it off the floor. From there, take a deep breath and bend your hips back, allowing the weight to swing back between your legs. Explosively extend your hips and exhale—allowing the momentum to swing the weight up to shoulder level. Control the descent, but use the momentum to begin the next rep.\\n\\nCIRCUIT 2\\n\\nTURKISH GETUP\\n\\nLie on your back on the floor holding a kettlebell with your right hand over your chest, arm perpendicular to the floor. Bend your right knee 90 degrees and plant your foot on the floor. Brace your abs and raise your torso off the floor. Use your left hand for support. Now use your right foot to raise your hips off the floor. Sweep your left leg back and rest on your left knee. Come up to a standing position, and then reverse the motion to return to the floor. Note that the foot that rests on the floor changes with the hand that’s holding the weight (when you perform the getup with the left hand, your left foot will lie flat). Perform one rep with the weight in your right hand and then immediately switch hands and repeat. Switch back to your right hand and do two reps. Then do two on your left. Continue adding one extra rep in this fashion until you’re up to five on each side. Without rest, reverse the process and work back down to one rep.\\n\\n06 MACHINES\\n\\nWe’ve never been big fans of machines at Men’s Fitness. For most people, they represent taking the path of least resistance—literally. Machines determine your range of motion and the way your muscles move the weight, so you don’t train your body to do these things. If you’re just getting into lifting and want to gain weight and get stronger, machines aren’t the best way to go. But if you’re older and have nagging injuries, or you want to isolate one muscle at a time to bring it up, machines may be your best weapons.\\n\\nOf course, you may find yourself in a situation where it’s\\n\\nmachines or bust, as in the case of some hotel gyms and community fitness centers. In any event, you can get just as hard a workout with machinery as you can with iron. A note here: Whenever possible, we’d prefer you do your machine exercises on Hammer Strength equipment (lifefitness.com). This is a quality brand that offers a unique feature—isolateral movement. That means you can lift each limb independently. In this way, Hammer Strength equipment follows your unique biomechanics, letting your limbs work in their natural fashion, rather than having to conform to the narrower paths that most machines set.\\n\\nTHE BEST ALL-MACHINE WORKOUT WORKOUT #13 BY JASON FERRUGGIA\\n\\nThere are three likely reasons y ou w ould do a w orkout entirely w ith\\n\\nmachines. O ne is that y ou fear free w eights. A nother is that y ou’re in\\n\\na hotel gy m w ith machines as y our only w orkout options, and the third is that\\n\\ny ou’re a little beat up and need to protect ov erw orked joints or w ork around\\n\\nnagging injuries. Whatev er the case may be, machines are suitable muscle-\\n\\nbuilding equipment, and y ou can train y our w hole body w ith them.\\n\\nHOW IT WORKS\\n\\nThis w orkout uses a classic body building approach: py ramid sets. You start\\n\\nw ith higher reps and increase the w eight slightly each set w hile reducing reps\\n\\nto gradually w arm up the muscles and joints and recruit more and more\\n\\nmuscle fibers. N o matter how hard y ou train or how heav y y ou go, y ou’re\\n\\nunlikely to get injured, because the machines are stabilizing the load for y ou.\\n\\nThis isn’t alw ay s ideal, but it does allow y ou to push y ourself and focus y our\\n\\nmind solely on the muscles y ou w ant to w ork w ithout w orry ing about a freak\\n\\naccident keeping y ou out of the gy m for w eeks.\\n\\nDIRECTIONS\\n\\nP erform the exercise pairs (marked “A ” and “B”) as alternating sets. S o y ou’ll\\n\\ndo a set of A , rest, then a set of B, rest again, and continue for all the\\n\\nprescribed sets. The remaining exercises are done as conv entional straight\\n\\nsets.\\n\\n1A CHEST PRESS\\n\\nSETS: 3 REPS: 12, 10, 8 REST: 60 SEC.\\n\\nAdjust the height of the seat so that the handles are in line with the middle of your chest. When you grasp the handles, your elbows should be bent nearly 90 degrees. Press the handles until your elbows are locked out. Keep tension on your muscles at the bottom of each rep.\\n\\n1B CHEST-SUPPORTED ROW\\n\\nSETS: 3 REPS: 12, 10, 8 REST: 60 SEC.\\n\\nUsing a chest-supported row machine, row the weight to your belly, squeezing your shoulder blades together at the top of the movement.\\n\\n2A SHOULDER PRESS\\n\\nSETS: 3 REPS: 12, 10, 8 REST: 60 SEC.\\n\\nAdjust the seat of a shoulder press machine so that the handles are at shoulder level. If you have shoulder problems, and if your machine allows it, grasp the handles so your palms face each other. Otherwise, grasp them with palms facing forward as normal. Make sure your elbows track in a normal pressing path as you press the handles overhead.\\n\\n2B NEUTRAL-GRIP PULLDOWN\\n\\nSETS: 3 REPS: 15, 12, 10 REST: 60 SEC.\\n\\nAttach a close-grip V-handle to the pulley of a lat- pulldown machine, or use two single-grip handles as shown. Grasp the handle so your palms face each other and set your legs under the pad. Pull the handle to your collarbone, driving your elbows down and back.\\n\\n3 CALF RAISE ON LEG PRESS\\n\\nSETS: 3 REPS: 25, 20, 15 REST: 60 SEC.\\n\\nSet up in a leg press machine and place your feet at the bottom of the foot plate at shoulder width so that only the balls of your feet are on the plate. Remove the safeties and allow the weight to flex your ankles slowly until you feel a stretch in your calves. Extend your ankles to raise the weight back up.\\n\\n4 LEG PRESS\\n\\nSETS: 4 REPS: 25, 20, 15, 10 REST: 120 SEC.\\n\\nAdjust the seat of the machine so that you can sit comfortably with your hips beneath your knees and your knees in line with your feet. Remove the safeties and lower your knees toward your chest until they’re bent 90 degrees and then press back up. Be careful not to go too low or you risk your lower back coming off the seat (which can cause injury).\\n\\n07 BANDS\\n\\nThe elastic exercise band tends to get lumped in with the Body Bar, aerobics step, and Shake Weight as so-called “wussy” equipment, while the barbell and dumbbell are beyond reproach. But this isn’t a fair judgment, especially if you’re using high-quality bands.\\n\\nWe like the loop bands that Elitefts.net sells. They’re\\n\\ndurable and can be used for multiple purposes andnumerous exercises. If a cheap one is all you have, you can make do, but Elite’s bands are a good investment, especiallyif you plan on traveling a lot. Lightweight and compact, they allow you to take your workouts with you. What bands provide that no other equipment (except\\n\\ncables) can is accommodating resistance. Take the pushup, for example. The closer you get to locking out your elbows, the easier the exercise feels. The movement feels hardest when your chest is close to the floor. Adding resistance to the pushup with a band will intensify the last few inches of the move—as the band gets more stretched out—making you work harder, and there’s nothing wussy about that.\\n\\nTHE BEST FULL-BODY BAND WORKOUT WORKOUT #14 BY BEN BRUNO\\n\\nThis w orkout gets y our blood mov ing. In fact, it makes it run up and\\n\\ndow n y our body as y ou alternate betw een upper- and low er-body\\n\\nexercises, forcing y our heart to w ork extra hard, w hich in turn, stimulates\\n\\ncalorie burning. The result is increased strength and conditioning w hile\\n\\ntrimming fat.\\n\\nHOW IT WORKS\\n\\nThe exercises are grouped into “non-competing” mini-circuits. This means that\\n\\nthey w ork different areas of the body so muscle fatigue isn’t carried ov er from\\n\\none mov e to the next. F or instance, follow ing up a pushup w ith a good\\n\\nmorning w on’t make y our chest any more tired, so y ou can giv e each\\n\\nexercise y our full effort and strength. Your heart, how ev er, experiences the\\n\\nopposite effect. With blood racing back and forth to different muscles, y our\\n\\nheart rate is constantly elev ated. This leads to more calories burned during the\\n\\nw orkout and greater fat loss afterw ard.\\n\\nDIRECTIONS\\n\\nP erform the exercise groups in sequence. S o y ou’ll do one set of A , B, and C ,\\n\\nresting as prescribed betw een them, and then repeat until all the prescribed\\n\\nsets for that group are completed. N ote that the last group is just tw o\\n\\nexercises, though done in the same fashion. M ake sure y ou hav e a few\\n\\ndifferent band options so y ou can use the appropriate tension on each\\n\\nexercise.\\n\\n1A PUSHUP\\n\\nSETS: 4 REPS: 10–12 REST: 60 SEC.\\n\\nGrasp the end of a band in one hand and wrap it around your back. Get into pushup position with your hands shoulder width and your core braced. Pin both hands to the floor with the ends of the band in your palms and perform pushups.\\n\\n1B GOOD MORNING\\n\\nSETS: 4 REPS: 12 REST: 60 SEC.\\n\\nStand on the band and loop the other end over the back of your neck and stand tall. Keeping your lower back in its natural arch, bend your hips back and lower your torso until it’s nearly parallel to the floor. Think about keeping your chest up and pointing forward. Explosively extend your hips to come back up.\\n\\n1C PULL APART\\n\\nSETS: 4 REPS: 10 REST: 60 SEC.\\n\\nStand on and grasp a band loop, or a single tube as shown, hands shoulder width. Keeping your arms straight, raise your arms in front of your body to shoulder level. Now, without letting your arms drop, draw your arms out 90 degrees to your sides as if you were pulling the tube apart. Squeeze your shoulder blades together.\\n\\n2A SQUAT\\n\\nSETS: 4 REPS: 20 REST: 60 SEC.\\n\\nStand on the band or tube with feet shoulder width and toes turned slightly out. Grasp the ends of the band in each hand and hold them at shoulder level with palms facing you. Bend your hips back and squat down as low as you can without losing the arch in your lower back. Explosively extend your hips to come back up.\\n\\n2B BAND ROW\\n\\nSETS: 4 REPS: 15 REST: 60 SEC.\\n\\nAttach the band to a doorknob or other sturdy object of similar height. Hold the opposite end in both hands and stand back from the door so you feel tension on the band. Row the band to your belly.\\n\\n2C PALLOF PRESS\\n\\nSETS: 4 REPS: 10 (EA CH SIDE) REST: 60 SEC.\\n\\nAttach the band to a sturdy object at stomach level. Hold the other end with both hands and step away from the attachment point, turning your body perpendicular to it to put tension on the band. Pull the band in front of your chest and then press it out with arms straight. Bend your arms and draw your hands back toward you, resisting the band from twisting your torso. That’s one rep.\\n\\n3A TRICEPS PUSHDOWN\\n\\nSETS: 4 REPS: 20 REST: 60 SEC.\\n\\nAttach the band to a sturdy overhead object and grasp the free end with both hands. Tuck your elbows to your sides and extend your elbows to lock them out.\\n\\n3B BICEPS CURL\\n\\nSETS: 4 REPS: 15 REST: 60 SEC.\\n\\nAnchor the band under your feet, holding an end in each hand. Curl it without letting your upper arms drift forward.\\n\\n08 SUSPENSION TRAINER\\n\\nThe suspension trainer boom began about a decade ago, and what was once a piece of novel equipment is now hanging in gyms everywhere. The most popular brand, of course, is the TRX (trx.com), but competitors like the Jungle Gym XT (lifelineusa.com)—which we use to show the exercises that follow—are fine, too, so long as they offer foot cradles for performing lower-body exercises. With a suspension trainer’s incredible versatility, the number of exercises you can perform with it is about aslimitless as your imagination. It allows you to train the whole body using exercises that would be nearly impossible with free weights, machines, or any other equipment. And unlike those other tools, the suspension trainer can travel anywhere you do, and takes up about as much space in your suitcase as a pair of pants.\\n\\nWe suggest you don’t leave home without either one.\\n\\nTHE BEST SUSPENSION- TRAINER WORKOUT WORKOUT #15 BY JAY CARDIELLO\\n\\nA suspension trainer, such as the TRX or Jungle G y m XT, can mean\\n\\nthe difference betw een sticking w ith y our training w hile on the road\\n\\nand returning from y our trav els feeling slobbish. S o long as y our suspension\\n\\ntrainer is fully adjustable and offers foot cradles y ou’ll hav e a total-body gy m\\n\\nthat y ou can unpack from y our suitcase w henev er, w herev er.\\n\\nHOW IT WORKS\\n\\nThe kind of instability a suspension trainer prov ides is ideal for core\\n\\nstrengthening. To increase the instability , w e’v e designed this w orkout using\\n\\nunilateral exercises, meaning that y ou’ll be training each side of y our body\\n\\nindiv idually . If y ou need to reduce the intensity of an exercise, simply\\n\\nincrease the angle of y our body to the floor (shorten the length of the\\n\\nhandles/straps).\\n\\nThe workout at right lets you customize your training,\\n\\ngiving you a specific period of time in which to do your reps, rather than a concrete number of reps to hit every set.\\n\\nDIRECTIONS\\n\\nP erform the exercises as a circuit, completing one set of each in sequence. Do\\n\\nas many reps as y ou can in 30 seconds, resting only as long as it takes to set\\n\\nup the next exercise. P erform tw o to four circuits.\\n\\n1 SINGLE-LEG ROW\\n\\nREPS: A S MA NY A S POSSIBLE IN 30 SEC. (EA CH SIDE) REST: 0 SEC.\\n\\nAttach a suspension trainer to a doorframe or other sturdy object and stand on your left leg. Hold the handles and get into a lunge position with your rear knee bent— but keep your foot raised above the floor. Row your body to the handles while driving your right knee up in front of you.\\n\\n2 SINGLE-LEG WOBBLE LUNGE\\n\\nREPS: A S MA NY A S POSSIBLE IN 30 SEC. (EA CH SIDE) REST: 0 SEC.\\n\\nSet the foot cradle of the suspension trainer to about a foot and a half above the floor and turn around. Raise your right foot and rest it inside the cradle. Bend your left knee so you descend into a lunge position.\\n\\n3 UNI-BRIDGE PRESS\\n\\nREPS: A S MA NY A S POSSIBLE IN 30 SEC. (EA CH SIDE) REST: 0 SEC.\\n\\nFace the suspension trainer’s attachment point and hold one handle in your left hand. Pick up a water bottle (or some other source of light resistance) in your right hand as if you were going to press. Lean back so your body is in a straight line at an angle, suspended by the handle. Row your body up until the handle touches your ribs while pressing the right hand over your chest.\\n\\n4 TAP OUT\\n\\nREPS: A S MA NY A S POSSIBLE IN 30 SEC. (EA CH SIDE) REST: 0 SEC.\\n\\nSet your feet in the cradles of the trainer and get into pushup position. Keeping your body straight, reach up with your right hand and tap the inside of your left elbow. Put your hand back down and repeat with the left hand. Continue for 30 seconds.\\n\\n5 PUSHUP ROCKET\\n\\nREPS: A S MA NY A S POSSIBLE IN 30 SEC. REST: 0 SEC.\\n\\nGet into pushup position with your feet in the cradles of the trainer and perform explosive pushups so that your hands leave the floor and you can clap in midair.\\n\\n09 MEDICINE BALL\\n\\nThe first medicine balls, used by athletes in ancient Persia, were bladders filled with sand. While medicine ball construction has come a long way since then, the science of how to use one hasn’t really had to evolve.\\n\\nMed balls can be thrown, caught, rested on, or lifted\\n\\nlike other weights, to apply a variety of stimuli to the muscles. Whether you want to experiment with one as a fun way to change up your workouts, or you find yourself someplace where the med ball (or a similar-sized volleyball or soccer ball) is the only implement you have to work with, we can show you how to use it like the sophisticated tool that it is.\\n\\nTHE BEST MEDICINE- BALL WORKOUT WORKOUT #16 BY ZACH EVEN-ESH\\n\\nThe medicine ball has been around forev er, but most guy s don’t know\\n\\nw hat to do w ith it, besides holding it against their chests during situps.\\n\\nE v en a light ball can deliv er an intense w orkout that burns fat and builds\\n\\nathletic pow er.\\n\\nHOW IT WORKS\\n\\nThe med ball can be used to replicate v arious O ly mpic w eightlifting exercises,\\n\\nand it makes performing them much simpler. These burn calories and build\\n\\nspeed, w hich is helpful if y ou’re interested in being competitiv e in backy ard\\n\\npickup games. In fact, the med ball is probably the most useful tool for\\n\\ndev eloping explosiv e strength because it’s meant to be throw n as hard as\\n\\npossible. When y ou toss it, y ou teach y our body to accelerate w ithout braking\\n\\nitself for safety .\\n\\nImagine a bench press done explosively—your shoulders\\n\\nmust slow it down at the end of the range of motion or they risk getting torn out of their sockets by the speed. The ball allows your body to “let go” safely because, well, you actually let go.\\n\\nA med ball can also be used to create an unstable\\n\\nsurface, such as by doing pushups on it. The dome shape\\n\\nforces you to stabilize your body more or risk taking a spill, and that means more activation of the abs.\\n\\nDIRECTIONS\\n\\nP erform the exercise pairs (marked “A ” and “B”) as supersets, so y ou’ll\\n\\ncomplete one set of A and then B before resting. Repeat until all sets are\\n\\ncomplete and then go on to the next superset.\\n\\n1A CLEAN AND PRESS\\n\\nSETS: 3 REPS: 10 REST: 0 SEC.\\n\\nHold the ball and stand with feet shoulder width. Bend your hips and knees and lower your body with arms extended until the ball is just above knee level. Explosively extend your hips and knees as if jumping, shrug your shoulders, and raise the ball to shoulder level. Squat down as you “catch” the momentum of the ball. Stand up and press it overhead. That’s one rep.\\n\\n1B SITUP AND THROW\\n\\nSETS: 3 REPS: 10 REST: 60 SEC.\\n\\nHold the ball with both hands in front of your chest and sit on the floor. Anchor your feet under something sturdy for support, and lie back on the floor a few feet away from a brick or concrete wall. Explosively sit up and throw the ball into the wall and then catch it on the rebound. If you have a partner, you can throw the ball to him instead and let him throw it back.\\n\\n2A MOUNTAIN CLIMBER\\n\\nSETS: 2 REPS: 20 (EA CH LEG) REST: 0 SEC.\\n\\nHold the ball with both hands and get into pushup position on the floor. Drive one knee up to your chest and then quickly drive it back while you raise the opposite knee.\\n\\n2B CLOSE-GRIP PUSHUP\\n\\nSETS: 2 REPS: 15 REST: 60 SEC.\\n\\nGet into pushup position on the floor, resting your hands on the ball. Keeping your body straight and your core braced, perform a pushup on the ball.\\n\\n3A BULGARIAN SPLIT SQUAT\\n\\nSETS: 2 REPS: 10 (EA CH SIDE) REST: 0 SEC.\\n\\nStand lunge length in front of a bench holding the ball with both hands at arm’s length overhead. Bend your left knee and rest the top of your left foot on the bench behind you. Lower your body until your front thigh is parallel to the floor.\\n\\n3B SEATED KNEE TUCK\\n\\nSETS: 2 REPS: 10 REST: 60 SEC.\\n\\nSit on a bench and squeeze the ball between your feet. Extend and elevate your legs out in front of you and extend your torso so that your body forms a straight line. Hold on to the bench for support. Crunch your torso forward and bring your knees to your chest.\\n\\n10 SWISS BALL\\n\\nSwiss balls were created as a tool for rehab, but their value in working the core and a host of stabilizer muscles is now universally known. If you’re a man of average height (about 5′9″), a ball with a 65-centimeter diameter will work best for you. Always make sure the ball is fully inflated and, for heaven’s sake, don’t try to stand on it. Wacky parlor tricks have given the Swiss ball a bad name, but used properly, it can improve your balance and strength rather than deprive you of them.\\n\\nTHE BEST SWISS-BALL WORKOUT WORKOUT #17 BY JIM SMITH, C.S.C.S.\\n\\nIt may be hard to imagine w orking y our entire body w ith just a S w iss\\n\\nball.

But the ball can let\\n\\ny ou get into positions to w ork y our muscles that y ou w ouldn’t normally think\\n\\nof, and the stability those positions require w orks more muscle than y ou\\n\\nrealize.\\n\\nHOW IT WORKS\\n\\nM any of the exercises flow into each other or consist of combinations of\\n\\nmov ements that flow together to equal one rep. C ontrolling these mov ements\\n\\non an unstable ball makes ev ery mov e a core exercise, ev en w hile y ou’re\\n\\ntargeting the chest, shoulders, legs, and back.\\n\\nDIRECTIONS\\n\\nP erform the exercises as a circuit, completing one set of each in turn w ithout\\n\\nrest. A fter the last exercise, rest tw o to three minutes and then repeat the\\n\\nentire circuit for three total sets.\\n\\n1 PUSHUP W/ FEET ON BALL\\n\\nSETS: 3 REPS: 20 REST: 0 SEC.\\n\\nGet into pushup position on the floor with hands shoulder width and rest your feet on the ball. Brace your abs and lower your body until your chest is just above the floor. Push back up. Do not let your hips dip or sway side to side at any point.\\n\\n2 T ON BALL\\n\\nSETS: 3 REPS: 20 REST: 0 SEC.\\n\\nLie chest-down on the ball and raise your arms out in front of you with palms facing up. Now move them out 90 degrees to form a T shape. Hold for one or two seconds with your shoulder blades squeezed together.\\n\\n3 BODY-WEIGHT SQUAT\\n\\nSETS: 3 REPS: 20 REST: 0 SEC.\\n\\nStand with feet shoulder width and toes turned out slightly. Sit back with your hips and lower your body as far as you can without rounding your lower back. Push your knees out as you descend and keep your chest up.\\n\\n4 LEG CURL\\n\\nSETS: 3 REPS: 20 REST: 0 SEC.\\n\\nLie on your back on the floor and rest your heels on a Swiss ball. Brace your abs and drive your heels into the ball to raise your hips off the floor. Bend your knees and roll the ball toward you. Keep your hips elevated the entire set.\\n\\n5 PIKE-UP TO SUPERMAN\\n\\nSETS: 3 REPS: 20 REST: 120–180 SEC.\\n\\nGet into pushup position with your toes on the ball. Bend your hips and roll the ball toward you so your torso becomes vertical. Roll back so your body is straight again and extend your spine, then roll the ball up your legs so your body forms a straight line with arms extended overhead but hands still on the floor. You should look like Superman flying downward. That’s one rep. Pull with your lats to return to the pushup position and begin the next rep.\\n\\n11 BODY WEIGHT\\n\\nThe most obvious advantage of body-weight workouts is that you can do them without equipment and in almost any location. But if that means absolutely no equipment— as in, not even a pullup bar—you’ll need to get pretty creative to be able to work your back.\\n\\nWe got that creative. When it’s warm, you may want to take your workouts\\n\\noutdoors and make use of equipment at your local playground, but you may not know how best to make a workout with it.\\n\\nWe know how to make a workout with it. If you thought body-weight training was just pushups\\n\\nand situps, these routines will open your eyes to the multitude of ways you can get ripped at those times when you feel as if you have no options at all.\\n\\nTHE BEST BODY-WEIGHT WORKOUT [option A] WORKOUT #18 BY ZACH EVEN-ESH\\n\\nIf y ou’v e ev er w ondered how guy s w ho w ork out exclusiv ely on\\n\\nmonkey bars in the park get so ripped, this w orkout is the answ er.

N ot only w ill y ou burn fat and build muscle w ith just\\n\\nthree exercises—y ou’ll learn one of the secrets street gy mnasts use to bang\\n\\nout dozens of reps of pullups and dips at a clip: the 10 to 1 method.\\n\\nHOW IT WORKS\\n\\nThe circuit w e’v e designed here doesn’t let up. When y ou train any squat\\n\\nv ariation, plus the pullup and the dip, y ou w ork nearly ev ery muscle in y our\\n\\nbody , and y our heart w ill race to supply them w ith blood and oxy gen.\\n\\nP erforming a decreasing number of reps—10 to 1—helps y ou keep the\\n\\nw orkout going despite being fatigued and builds the endurance that ultimately\\n\\nleads to being able to rattle off a high number of reps in one shot. In addition\\n\\nto getting y ou leaner, feel free to use this w orkout to w in bar bets about how\\n\\nmany pullups y ou can do.\\n\\nDIRECTIONS\\n\\nP erform the exercises as a circuit, completing a set of each in turn and resting\\n\\nas little as possible betw een sets. Repeat for 10 circuits (until y ou’re doing\\n\\nonly one rep per exercise).\\n\\n1 JUMP SQUAT\\n\\nREPS: 10 TO 1 REST: 0 SEC.\\n\\nStand with feet shoulder-width apart and squat down about halfway. Jump as high as you can. Land with soft knees and begin the next rep. Perform 10 reps. Each time you repeat the circuit, perform one less rep. So the next round you’ll do 9 reps, then 8, and so on down to 1 rep.\\n\\n2 PULLUP\\n\\nREPS: 10 TO 1 REST: 0 SEC.\\n\\nHang from a pullup bar, jungle gym, or tree limb and pull yourself up until your chin is higher than your hands. Perform 10 reps down to 1 as described at left.\\n\\n3 DIP\\n\\nREPS: 10 TO 1 REST: 0 SEC.\\n\\nSuspend yourself over parallel bars and then lower your body until your upper arms are parallel to the floor. Perform 10 reps down to 1.\\n\\nTHE BEST BODY-WEIGHT WORKOUT [option B] WORKOUT #19 BY ZACH EVEN-ESH\\n\\nA lack of training equipment doesn’t necessarily doom y ou to a\\n\\nw orkout consisting only of pullups and pushups. With a little creativ ity ,\\n\\ny ou can still train like an animal (y ou’ll get the reference below ) w hile\\n\\ntargeting y our entire body —not just the upper. This w orkout is outside the box\\n\\n—so much so, in fact, that y ou’ll hav e to go outdoors to do it.\\n\\nHOW IT WORKS\\n\\nThis routine requires a park or play ground area w ith monkey bars and plenty\\n\\nof open space. You’ll use classic, though under-prescribed, body -w eight\\n\\nexercises like the bear craw l and crab w alk, w hich y ou probably hav en’t tried\\n\\nsince y our day s in summer camp. A s y ou’ll come to remember, they ’re not\\n\\neasy —especially for a grow n man w ell north of 100 pounds. They require a\\n\\nlot of w ork from y our heart, lungs, and core. Later, the parallel bar hand w alk\\n\\nw ill blow up y our grip and forearms; the sprints w ill fry y our legs.\\n\\nDIRECTIONS\\n\\nP erform the exercise pairs (marked “A ” and “B”) as supersets, so y ou’ll\\n\\ncomplete one set of A and then one set of B before resting. Repeat until all\\n\\nsets are complete. N ote that the parallel bar hand w alk is done as straight sets\\n\\n—do a set, rest, and repeat.\\n\\nThis workout combines well with Body-Weight option A,\\n\\nso if you want to integrate them both into a training week, perform A first, rest a day, and then perform B. (You can also add in option C, coming up next.)\\n\\n1A BEAR CRAWL\\n\\nSETS: 3 REPS: CRA WL FOR 50 FEET REST: 0 SEC.\\n\\nBend down and plant your hands on the ground.

But if y ou hav e nothing elev ated on w hich to step, y ou can substitute a\\n\\nlunge for the stepup. To target y our back, w hich is usually unw orkable\\n\\nw ithout hav ing at least a bar of some sort to pull on, w e’re employ ing the\\n\\n“blurpee”—as made famous by fitness expert Tim F erriss, author of The F our-\\n\\nH our Body .\\n\\nThe wider foot placement used in the blurpee requires more work from the lats to pull the hips and legs forward as the body comes back from the pushup position. (The\\n\\nextra “l” in blurpee stands for “lats.”)\\n\\nDIRECTIONS\\n\\nP erform the exercises as conv entional straight sets, completing all sets for one\\n\\nexercise before mov ing on to the next.\\n\\n1 CLOSE-GRIP PUSHUP\\n\\nSETS: 3 REPS: 15 REST: 60–90 SEC.\\n\\nGet into pushup position and place your hands close so that your thumbs touch. Keep your body straight and your core braced. If that’s too easy, elevate your feet on a chair or some other raised surface.\\n\\n2 STEPUP\\n\\nSETS: 3 REPS: 20 REST: 60–90 SEC.\\n\\nStand in front of a bench or chair and place one foot on it so that your thigh is parallel to the floor. Drive your heel into the surface and squeeze your glutes as you step up onto the bench, but let your trailing foot hang off of it.\\n\\n3 BLURPEE\\n\\nSETS: 3 REPS: 20 REST: 60–90 SEC.\\n\\nStand with feet outside shoulder width and bend down and place your hands on the floor.

Not that you’ll ever get bored of bombing your bi’s and tri’s, but we’ve provided you with five different ways to work them—with a barbell, dumbbells, bands, a suspension trainer, and yes, even body weight alone. Just try to leave some time in your week for the leg workouts, OK?\\n\\nTHE BEST DUMBBELL- ONLY ARM WORKOUT WORKOUT #22 BY JIM SMITH, C.S.C.S.\\n\\nYou can’t go w rong w ith a pair of dumbbells. A rguably the most\\n\\nv ersatile equipment in a trainer’s arsenal, dumbbells are a fav orite\\n\\namong competitiv e body builders, w ho happen to know a thing or tw o about\\n\\nstacking impressiv e arms. Whether or not y ou w ant body build-eresque arms,\\n\\ndumbbells can prov e inv aluable in y our quest to improv e them.\\n\\nHOW IT WORKS\\n\\nYou’ll make use of peak contractions (holding the top, flexed, position of a rep\\n\\nfor a second or tw o), slow negativ es (low ering the w eight w ith control), and\\n\\nstretching betw een sets. A ll of these strategies increase blood flow to the\\n\\narms and encourage grow th.\\n\\nDIRECTIONS\\n\\nP erform 1A and 1B as supersets. S o y ou’ll complete one set of A and then go\\n\\non to B before resting. Repeat for the prescribed sets. E xercises 2A , 2B, and\\n\\n2C are a triset—complete one set of each w ithout rest and then repeat for all\\n\\nthe prescribed sets.\\n\\n1A SEATED CURL\\n\\nSETS: 3 REPS: 12 REST: 0 SEC.\\n\\nSit on an incline bench or seat with a backrest holding a dumbbell in each hand. Keeping your upper arms against your sides, curl the weights simultaneously, rotating your wrists outward so that your palms face you in the top position. Hold the top position for two seconds, squeezing your biceps, and take three to five seconds to lower the weights on each rep.\\n\\n1B DIAMOND PUSHUP\\n\\nSETS: 3 REPS: 20 REST: 60 SEC.\\n\\nGet into pushup position but place your hands close together so your thumbs and index fingers touch. Keeping your body in a straight line with abs braced, lower your torso until your chest is just above the floor and then press back up.\\n\\n2A HAMMER CURL\\n\\nSETS: 4 REPS: 8 REST: 0 SEC.\\n\\nHold a dumbbell in each hand with palms facing your sides. Keeping your upper arms against your sides, curl the weights at the same time.\\n\\n2B NEUTRAL-GRIP TRICEPS EXTENSION\\n\\nSETS: 4 REPS: 12 REST: 0 SEC.\\n\\nLie back on a bench or the floor holding a dumbbell in each hand with palms facing each other. Press the weights over your chest and then bend your elbows to lower the weights toward your face until you feel a stretch in your triceps. Extend your elbows. Keep your elbows facing the ceiling the entire set.\\n\\n2C BICEPS/TRICEPS STRETCH\\n\\nSETS: 4 REPS: HOLD FOR 30 SEC. (EA CH SIDE)\\n\\nPlace the palm of one hand on a bench, box, or other low, flat surface with your fingers pointing toward you. Lean away to apply a stretch and hold it for 30 seconds. Now reach your arm overhead and bend the elbow. Gently pull your arm behind your head to stretch your triceps for 30 seconds.\\n\\nTHE BEST BARBELL-ONLY ARM WORKOUT WORKOUT #23 BY JASON FERRUGGIA\\n\\nA barbell’s main selling point is that it allow s y ou to maximally\\n\\nstimulate muscle, but it isn’t w ritten in stone (or, perhaps, iron) that\\n\\ny ou must use heav y w eights, or any w eight at all. If a barbell is all y ou hav e\\n\\nto train w ith, w e’ll assume that y ou don’t hav e a lot of w eight at y our\\n\\ndisposal any w ay , so this w orkout is a minimalist’s dream.\\n\\nHOW IT WORKS\\n\\nThe P oundstone curl is simply a barbell curl done w ith the empty bar alone—\\n\\nfor an enormous number of reps (in this case, w e prescribe 100). It’s named\\n\\nafter professional strongman Derek P oundstone, w ho, despite being 350\\n\\npounds w ith biceps like footballs, still sw ears by this deceptiv ely hard\\n\\nexercise. The point is simply to giv e the biceps shock treatment w ith a\\n\\nprotocol they ’v e nev er encountered before—v ery high reps and short rest until\\n\\nexhaustion.\\n\\nThe pullover/triceps extension works your lats as well as your triceps. By getting the lats involved, you incorporate strong stabilizing muscles that will let you go a little heavier on the triceps extensions—even if all the weight you have left to add is a couple of 2.5-pound plates.\\n\\nDIRECTIONS\\n\\nP erform all the sets for the first exercise before mov ing on to the second.\\n\\n1 POUNDSTONE CURL\\n\\nSETS: A S MA NY A S NEEDED REPS: 100 TOTA L REST: A S NEEDED\\n\\nGrasp the barbell at shoulder width. Keeping your upper arms at your sides, curl the bar.\\n\\n2 PULLOVER/TRICEPS EXTENSION\\n\\nSETS: 6 REPS: 12–15 REST: 45 SEC.\\n\\nHold the bar with an overhand, shoulder-width grip and lie back on a flat bench. Press the bar toward the ceiling and then reach it back over your head while bending your elbows until you feel a stretch in your lats. Then pull the bar back over your chest and extend your elbows.\\n\\nTHE BEST BAND-ONLY ARM WORKOUT WORKOUT #24 BY NICK TUMMINELLO\\n\\nS ometimes building muscle is as simple as doing reps as fast as y ou\\n\\ncan to get a pump as quickly as possible. It may sound haphazard,\\n\\nbut this band-only w orkout can add as much as an inch to y our upper arms in\\n\\njust six w eeks!\\n\\nHOW IT WORKS\\n\\nThis w orkout should be implemented for a period of six w eeks—enough time\\n\\nto elicit grow th, but not so much as to allow y our muscles to adapt to the\\n\\nstresses. O v er this time period, y ou’ll gradually increase the v olume y ou\\n\\nperform on y our exercises (there are only tw o), w hich forces y our body to\\n\\nadapt to a rapidly increasing w orkload. The pushdow n and curl pump y our\\n\\narms full of blood, driv ing nutrients into the muscles and stretching their cells.\\n\\nA s fun as the pump is for show ing off, it’s also a sign that real grow th is on\\n\\nthe w ay .\\n\\nDIRECTIONS\\n\\nA lternate the band pushdow n and band curl.

In\\n\\nWeeks 5 and 6, perform four sets. A ssuming y ou’re follow ing the w eight-gain\\n\\neating rules outlined in C hapter 1, y ou could see up to a solid inch added to\\n\\ny our arms in that span.\\n\\n1 BAND PUSHDOWN\\n\\nREPS: 60 REST: 0 SEC.\\n\\nAttach the band to the top of a sturdy object, such as a pipe or a beam. If you’re using a loop band, grasp the middle of it with both hands. Tuck your elbows to your sides and extend your elbows as in a triceps pushdown. Try to get 60 reps in 30 seconds. It’s OK if you rock back and forth a bit.\\n\\n2 BAND CURL\\n\\nREPS: 60 REST: 120 SEC.\\n\\nAnchor the band under your feet, holding the other end with both hands. Curl as fast as you can for 30 seconds, aiming again for 60 reps.\\n\\nTHE BEST SUSPENSION- TRAINER ARM WORKOUT WORKOUT #25 BY BEN BRUNO\\n\\nO v er the past decade, suspension trainers hav e sky rocketed in\\n\\npopularity , and for good reason. The kind of w hole-body training y ou\\n\\ncan perform on a suspension sy stem is as efficient as it is effectiv e, and\\n\\nstudies hav e show n that compound mov ements release more muscle-building\\n\\nhormones than do isolation mov es. While the follow ing w orkout seems to\\n\\ntarget y our entire upper body , the stress it places on y our arms in particular\\n\\nw ill get them looking as good as if they w ere trained w ith isolation\\n\\nmov ements.\\n\\nHOW IT WORKS\\n\\nThe w orkout starts w ith pushups and row s. It w ill hit the chest, shoulders,\\n\\nand back, too, of course; but it w on’t shortchange y our biceps and triceps. In\\n\\nfact, ev en though y ou’re not w orking them in isolation, the bi’s and tri’s w ill\\n\\nkick in harder because they ’re lifting more of y our w eight than they could if\\n\\ny ou w ere doing simple curls or extensions. N ev ertheless, there’s a place for\\n\\nthese mov ements, too—right after the compound lifts, w hen y ou’re looking to\\n\\nfinish the arms off w ith more direct stimulation.\\n\\nDIRECTIONS\\n\\nP erform the exercise pairs (marked “A ” and “B”) as alternating sets. You’ll do\\n\\na set of A , rest, then a set of B, rest again, and continue for all the prescribed\\n\\nsets.\\n\\n1A PUSHUP\\n\\nSETS: 4 REPS: 10–12 REST: 60 SEC.\\n\\nAttach the suspension trainer to a sturdy overhead object and lengthen the straps to a point where you’re sure you can do 10–12 pushups. (You can lower the handles over time to make the set harder, and later, elevate your feet; shorten the straps to make it easier.) Grasp the handles and get into pushup position with hands under your shoulders. Your entire body should be straight and your core braced. Lower your body until your chest is between the handles.\\n\\n1B ROTATIONAL INVERTED ROW\\n\\nSETS: 4 REPS: 10–12 REST: 60 SEC.\\n\\nHold the handles and lean back with arms extended so that your body is supported by the trainer and only your feet are on the floor. Brace your core and hold your body in a straight line. (The lower you set the handles, the harder the exercise; you can elevate your feet to make it even harder.) Start with your palms facing your feet, and as you row your body up, twist your wrists outward so that your palms face up in the top position.\\n\\n2A TRICEPS EXTENSION\\n\\nSETS: 4 REPS: 10 REST: 60 SEC.\\n\\nLengthen the straps and stand underneath the trainer’s anchor point. Lean your weight forward and bend your elbows so you feel a stretch in your triceps. Your palms should face each other behind your head. Keeping your body straight and your abs braced, extend your elbows, rotating your palms so they face down in the extended position.\\n\\n2B BICEPS CURL\\n\\nSETS: 4 REPS: 10 REST: 60 SEC.\\n\\nFace the trainer’s attachment point and grasp the handles with palms facing up. Lean back with your abs braced, body straight, and arms extended in front of you. Curl your body up to the handles.\\n\\nTHE BEST BODY-WEIGHT ARM WORKOUT WORKOUT #26 BY BEN BRUNO\\n\\nWhat if y ou’v e got nothing—no barbells, no dumbbells, no bands, or a\\n\\nsuspension sy stem—but are still itching to pump up the guns? N o\\n\\nproblem! S o long as y ou can find an ov erhead pipe or crossbar that w ill\\n\\nsupport y our w eight, and some lev el ground, y ou can w ork y our arms. In\\n\\nfact, by follow ing the w orkout below , y ou w on’t just w ork y our arms; y ou’ll\\n\\nmake them grow .\\n\\nHOW IT WORKS\\n\\nU pper-body training, in its simplest terms, is about pushing and pulling. P air\\n\\nthe tw o mov ement patterns up and y ou’v e got a complete arm blast, and\\n\\nthat’s w hat w e did here. You’ll finish w ith eccentric chinups, w hich are just\\n\\nnormal chins done w ith an extra-slow negativ e. This causes more muscle\\n\\ndamage in the biceps, leading to greater grow th, and that’s alw ay s cool—\\n\\nev en if there’s no one else around to notice.\\n\\nDIRECTIONS\\n\\nP erform the exercise pairs (marked “A ” and “B”) as alternating sets. You’ll do\\n\\na set of A , rest, then a set of B, rest again, and continue for all the prescribed\\n\\nsets.\\n\\n1A CLOSE-GRIP PUSHUP\\n\\nSETS: 5 REPS: 12–15 REST: 60 SEC.\\n\\nPlace your hands inside shoulder width and lower your body until your chest is about an inch above the floor. To increase the difficulty, elevate your feet on a bench or box.\\n\\n1B CHINUP\\n\\nSETS: 5 REPS: 6–8 REST: 60 SEC.\\n\\nGrasp the chinup bar at (or slightly inside) shoulder width, with palms facing you. Pull yourself up until your chin is over the bar.\\n\\n2A TRICEPS EXTENSION\\n\\nSETS: 4 REPS: 10 REST: 60 SEC.\\n\\nGet into pushup position and rest your forearms on the floor, palms down. Keeping your core tight and your body in a straight line, extend your elbows so your arms are straight.\\n\\n2B ECCENTRIC CHINUP\\n\\nSETS: 4 REPS: 3 REST: 60 SEC.\\n\\nGrasp a chinup bar at shoulder width with palms facing you and jump into the top position of a chinup. Take five seconds to lower yourself down to the hang position. That’s one rep.\\n\\n13 BICEPS\\n\\nWhen you first start training, an equal amount of arm work for the biceps and triceps is enough to stimulate even gains. But down the line, one muscle always seems to develop ahead of the other and you end up needing to give the weaker one greater attention. If it’s your biceps, you’re about to learn a bevy of new curls that will peak your peaks fast and for a long time to come.\\n\\nTHE BEST FULL-GYM BICEPS WORKOUT WORKOUT #27 BY HARRY CLAY\\n\\nWhen y ou’v e got total gy m access y ou need to take adv antage of it.\\n\\nH ow ev er, for the more zealous among us, there is a risk of\\n\\nov ertraining smaller body parts—like biceps—in an attempt to sample all of a\\n\\ngy m’s w ares.

F attening the grip on dumbbell curls requires more tension\\n\\nfrom y our hands and forearms to hoist the w eight, and this transfers to y our\\n\\nbiceps. The rarely seen behind-the-back cable curl puts the biceps at an\\n\\nespecially tough mechanical disadv antage, w hich forces y ou to ov ercome a\\n\\nlot of resistance as y ou contract them from a stretched position. The E Z-bar\\n\\npreacher curl finishes the w orkout w ith the strictest possible mov ement.\\n\\nDIRE C TIO N S P erform the exercises at the end of an upper-body w orkout\\n\\nonce per w eek.\\n\\n1 FAT-GRIP HAMMER CURL\\n\\nSETS: 3 REPS: 10–12 REST: 60 SEC.\\n\\nSelect two dumbbells and wrap towels around each handle to thicken it. Another option is to use rubber-grip sleeves like Fat Gripz (available at fatgripz.com) or Grip4orce (shown below, grip4orce.com). Keeping your upper arms stationary at your sides and your palms facing, curl the weights.\\n\\n2 BEHIND-THE-BACK CABLE CURL\\n\\nSETS: 3 REPS: 10–12 (EA CH SIDE) REST: 60 SEC.\\n\\nAttach a D-handle to the low pulley of a cable machine, grasp the handle in your left hand, and step forward (away from the machine) until there is tension on the cable and your arm is drawn slightly behind your body. Stagger your feet so your right leg is in front. Curl the handle but do not allow your elbow to point forward.\\n\\n3 EZ-BAR PREACHER CURL\\n\\nSETS: 2 REPS: 8–10 REST: 60 SEC.\\n\\nSit at a preacher bench and adjust the height so that your armpits touch the top of the bench. Grasp an EZ- curl bar at shoulder width with arms extended (but allow a slight bend at the elbows). Curl the bar, keeping the backs of your arms against the bench. Take three seconds to lower the bar back down.\\n\\nTHE BEST BARBELL-ONLY BICEPS WORKOUT WORKOUT #28 BY JIM SMITH, C.S.C.S.\\n\\nThe biceps are small muscles that aren’t designed to handle a lot of\\n\\nw eight, but they do respond w ell to high reps, short rest periods, and\\n\\nmultiple angles. With only a barbell loaded w ith a modest amount of w eight\\n\\nand some earnest effort, y ou can build a solid pair of biceps muscles w ithout\\n\\nov ertaxing y our biceps tendons.\\n\\nH O W IT WO RKS The w orkout starts w ith a rev erse curl—the w eakest grip\\n\\ny ou can curl w ith because y our palms are facing dow n.

MURPHY, M.F.S.\\n\\nIt w as once thought that the pump w as just a cosmetic side effect of\\n\\nlifting w eights, but it’s actually an integral part of the muscle-building\\n\\nprocess. P erforming reps creates tension in the muscles that, to some degree,\\n\\npinches off the v eins that take blood out of them w hile the arteries that\\n\\ndeliv er blood to the muscles continue unobstructed. S o the muscles fill up w ith\\n\\nblood faster than they can be cleared of it. This “cell sw elling” stretches the\\n\\nmuscle cell membranes, sending the body the message that the muscles aren’t\\n\\nbig enough to handle the blood flow to them.\\n\\nBands create enormous tension throughout a muscle’s\\n\\nentire range of motion, and yet the tension is easily adjusted depending on how you stand or position your body. This makes them great tools for pumping up your biceps.\\n\\nH O W IT WO RKS The w orkout is designed for use w ith tw o or more bands,\\n\\nbut if y ou hav e only one, y ou can perform any of the curls one arm at a\\n\\ntime.

Spread your arms apart as in a normal dumbbell flye and lower your body until you feel a stretch in your chest, then squeeze the dumbbells and bring your hands back to pushup position. Keep your abs and glutes braced and your back flat throughout. If you’re using plate-loaded dumbbells, you may be able to roll the weight plates on the floor during the flye. Otherwise, you can place a towel under each dumbbell to facilitate sliding. If this is too difficult, perform the exercise on your knees.\\n\\n3 PULLOVER\\n\\nSETS: 3 REPS: 12–15 REST: 60 SEC.\\n\\nLie on your back on the floor and hold one dumbbell overhead with both hands.

Allow your arms to extend in front of you. Squeeze your shoulder blades together and draw your arms back until they’re 90 degrees out to your sides. (Keep a slight bend in your elbows.) That’s one rep of the reverse flye. Perform five reps. Now, from the start position of the reverse flye, draw your upper arms back with your elbows bent 90 degrees and knuckles facing the ceiling. Your upper body should make a W shape. That’s one rep of the external rotation. Perform five reps. From there, return to the starting position with arms extended and pull your hands to your forehead, twisting your palms to face in front of you as you pull. That’s one face pull. Perform five reps.

The imbalance results from sitting at desks w ith poor posture\\n\\nfor hours on end and is compounded by most gy mgoers’ preference for bench\\n\\npresses ov er rear-delt exercises. This workout forces your rear delts to work harder than they ever have, and you’ll need only your body weight to do it.\\n\\nH O W IT WO RKS The Y raise and rear-delt fly e may be familiar to y ou, as\\n\\nthey ’re often performed w ith dumbbells. But a suspension trainer makes them\\n\\nmore effectiv e because y ou’re lifting y our body w eight as opposed to tiny\\n\\n(and possibly pink) hand w eights.

Get into pushup position with your feet in the cradles and hands placed shoulder width on the floor. Keeping your abs braced, lower your body until your chest is just above the floor and then push back up. Now bend your hips and raise them into the air until your torso is vertical. Straighten your body again. That’s one rep.\\n\\n2 Y RAISE\\n\\nSETS: 2 REPS: 12–15 REST: 60 SEC.\\n\\nGrasp the handles and stand with feet about shoulder width. Lean back 45–60 degrees, so your body is supported by the trainer, and brace your abs. Raise your arms up and out into a Y shape with palms facing forward. Your body will become more vertical, but don’t allow your shoulders to lose tension at the top of the movement. Your weight will shift from the back foot to the front foot.\\n\\n3 REAR-DELT FLYE\\n\\nSETS: 4 REPS: 12–15 REST: 60 SEC.\\n\\nShorten the length of the handles, but stand as you did for the Y raise.

Push your hands into the floor to drive your weight back so your hips rise into the air. Your back should be straight and your head behind your hands. Lower your body in an arcing motion so that your chest scoops downward and nearly scrapes the floor. Continue moving forward as you press your body up so your torso is vertical and your legs are straight and nearly on the floor.

Your arms should form a Y shape with your body. Hold for a second. From there, bend your elbows and draw your arms back until your elbows are near your sides and your body now forms a W shape. Hold for a second. Think about doing a pullup—you’re performing the same movement on the floor.\\n\\n1C SHOULDER STRETCH\\n\\nSETS: 4 REPS: HOLD FOR 30 SEC.

MURPHY, M.F.S.\\n\\nYour av erage trainer can think of only tw o w ay s to w ork y our\\n\\nshoulders w ith dumbbells—presses and raises. We’v e got a third to add\\n\\nto the mix, and this three-pronged attack can build shoulders as round and\\n\\ndense as cannonballs.\\n\\nH O W IT WO RKS The first exercise, a neutral-grip ov erhead press, is the\\n\\nsafest w ay to do any pressing mov ement. If y ou’v e backed off of shoulder\\n\\nw ork in the past because it hurt to execute, relief can be as simple as turning\\n\\ny our palms to face each other. In this position, y our upper-arm bones can\\n\\nglide through the shoulder joints w ithout risk of impingement.\\n\\nYou’ll follow this up with a variety of shoulder raises, ending with a crucifix hold, in which you keep your arms raised for time. This is an exercise popular among strongman competitors, whose shoulders are the size of pumpkins. Finally, the workout ends with seated dumbbell cleans. If you’ve ever done power cleans, you know what exploding a weight up from the floor to shoulder level can do for your shoulders, and this variation isolates them\\n\\nmore. It’s as simple to do as it sounds: heave the weights up. Brute force builds big shoulders.\\n\\nDIRE C TIO N S C omplete all sets for one exercise before mov ing on to the\\n\\nnext.\\n\\n1 NEUTRAL-GRIP OVERHEAD PRESS\\n\\nSETS: 5 REPS: 8 REST: 60 SEC.\\n\\nHold a dumbbell in each hand at shoulder level with palms facing each other and elbows pointing forward. Brace your core and press the weights straight overhead. At the top, shrug your shoulders and hold for a second.\\n\\n2 RAISE COMPLEX\\n\\nSETS: 3 REPS: 12–15 REST: SEE BELOW\\n\\nHold dumbbells at your sides with palms facing you. Raise the weights up in front of you to shoulder level with thumbs pointing up. Complete 12–15 reps and then raise the weights out to your sides 90 degrees (bend your elbows a bit as you lift). Complete your reps and then switch to a lighter pair of dumbbells. Raise them out to your sides and up to ear level with straight arms and thumbs pointing up. Hold this position 30 seconds. Squeeze your glutes to help support you.\\n\\n3 SEATED DUMBBELL CLEAN\\n\\nSETS: 3 REPS: 12–15 REST: 60 SEC.\\n\\nHold a dumbbell in each hand and sit on the edge of a bench. Keeping your lower back flat, lean forward. Explosively straighten your body and shrug the weights so your arms rise. Allow the momentum to flip your wrists so you catch the weights at shoulder level.\\n\\n18 BACK\\n\\nGetting your mind into back training isn’t as easy as it is with the chest and arms. Because you can’t see your back, it is tougher to visualize how it is working, and so you must learn to focus on the feeling of your muscles contracting with each rep. Finding the right training implements for your needs can help with this. If dumbbells don’t work for you, bands might, because their accommodating resistance makes reps feel different than with free weights. It’s possible that simple pullups do the trick, because you’re able to imagine your hands as hooks designed to allow your lats to move your body up and down. Whatever may work best for you, we’ve got it covered here, so you can build your back with the same intensity you do your arms.\\n\\nTHE BEST FULL-GYM BACK WORKOUT WORKOUT #53 BY JIM SMITH, C.S.C.S.\\n\\nDeadlifts are one of our fav orite exercises at M en’s F itness.

Keeping your back flat, extend your hips to stand up, pulling the bar up along your legs to lockout. Perform three warmup sets of five reps using 20%, 40%, and 60% of your deadlift max, respectively. (If you don’t know how much you can lift for one rep on the deadlift, estimate it conservatively.) Rest 90 seconds between these warmups. When you’re done, perform one set with 70–75% of your max for five reps and then rest 15 seconds. Perform three more sets of as many reps as possible, resting 15 seconds between sets. You may get only one or two reps on these last three sets, and that’s OK.

The trick is to keep the circuit going, switching to exercises that are just easy enough to let you continue doing reps. Unlike with weights, dropsets based on mechanical advantage allow you to keep the same load— your body—which ensures your lats get the greatest possible stimulus.\\n\\nDIRE C TIO N S P erform the exercises as a circuit, completing one set of each\\n\\nin sequence w ithout rest.

Eventually, every guy has to work his calves, even if it’s only during the few months leading up to summer. We don’t blame you for skipping them—even great trainers fail to program calf work into workouts because they don’t contribute to overall size, strength, and athleticism like the other muscles do. But that doesn’t mean they can’t bring your whole physique down if they’re stringy.\\n\\nThese routines bring the calves up fast.

Having a thick neck and traps that reach to your ears (collectively called “the yoke”) is the hallmark of defensive linemen, wrestlers, bouncers, and other badasses who clearly don’t work out just to look pretty. A guy who’s yoked looks like he can handle business.\\n\\nGetting that look isn’t as hard as you might think, but you will need either a barbell or dumbbells. With them, and the following workouts, you’ll never have to worry about being called a “pencil-neck geek” ever again.\\n\\nTHE BEST BARBELL-ONLY TRAPS WORKOUT WORKOUT #78 BY JASON FERRUGGIA\\n\\nYou’v e got to feel bad for w ould-be body builders w ho try to isolate\\n\\ntheir traps w ith a dozen different exercises and still can’t get them to\\n\\ngrow —w hile O ly mpic w eightlifters focus on just tw o lifts and their traps are\\n\\nup to their ears. The reason is that the snatch—one of the tw o exercises\\n\\ncontested in w eightlifting competition—incorporates a pow erful shrugging\\n\\nmotion that requires a lot of effort from the traps.

Instead, we split up our body into parts that we train on different days; hence the term “split routine.” Yet there exists another way—to train the entire upper body one day and the lower half another—and there are several advantages to it.\\n\\nWorking the whole upper body one day allows you to\\n\\ncome back a few days later and work it again. Say you normally train your chest once every five days. You could hit it twice in three days, doubling the muscle-building stimulus simply by switching from body-part workouts to an upper-body split.\\n\\nUpper-body splits are also ideal for strength building,\\n\\nallowing you to focus workouts around a main lift and then working all the muscles that play a part in making that lift stronger.\\n\\nThe upper-body workouts we’ve included here pair up\\n\\nwell with the lower-body routines that follow them, something to consider if you’re looking for a complete program.\\n\\nTHE BEST UPPER-BODY WORKOUT [option A] WORKOUT #80 BY C.J.

Do not perform this w orkout more than tw ice a w eek, and allow at\\n\\nleast three day s before repeating it.\\n\\nOn each lift that you use the 25-rep rule for, spend the\\n\\nfirst three or four sets warming up so that only the last two are done with heavy weights. For a lower-body workout to match this one, flip to the next chapter.\\n\\n1 OVERHEAD PRESS\\n\\nSETS: 5 REPS: 5 REST: 90 SEC.\\n\\nSet the bar up in a squat rack or cage and grasp it just outside shoulder width.

Pull the bar out of the rack and lower it to your sternum, tucking your elbows about 45 degrees to your sides. When the bar touches your body, drive your feet hard into the floor and press the bar back up. Perform several warmup sets, keeping your reps to five or fewer. Gradually work up to the heaviest weight that you can perform three reps with (this should take at least five sets). Refer back to chapter 2 for instructions on how to work up appropriately. Be sure to use a spotter or perform your sets in a power rack with spotter bars in place.\\n\\n2 NEUTRAL-GRIP FLOOR PRESS\\n\\nSETS: 4 REPS: 8, 8, 6, 5 REST: 180 SEC.\\n\\nGrasp a dumbbell in each hand and lie back on the floor.

Keeping your upper arms in place, curl the weights, rotating your palms to face your biceps in the top position. Turn your palms to face down, and then lower the weights slowly, as in a reverse curl. That’s one rep.\\n\\n25 LOWER BODY\\n\\nBecause the abs and lower back are automatically involved in any kind of leg training you do it makes sense to work them on the same day you do squats or other lower-body training. This is the template for the classic lower-body split.\\n\\nCombine these with the upper-body workouts on the\\n\\nprevious pages and you can put together a six-week program for total-body muscle and strength that also adds pounds to your favorite lifts fast.\\n\\nTHE BEST LOWER-BODY WORKOUT [option A] WORKOUT #82 BY C.J.

Note that the rest interval does not mean\\n\\ncomplete rest, but a very easy pace. If you don’t have a heart rate monitor, you can estimate your heart rate by putting your index and middle fingers to your carotid artery (to the left of your throat) and counting the beats in your pulse for six seconds.

(So, a 30-year-old would have an approximate MHR of 190 beats per minute.) The high-intensity work sets call for a heart rate that’s 85–95% of your maximum; so, a 30-year- old will keep his heart rate between 160 and 180 beats per minute during that time.\\n\\nNote that the rest interval does not mean complete rest, but a very easy pace. If you don’t have a heart rate monitor, you can estimate your heart rate by putting your index and middle fingers on your carotid artery (to the left of your throat) and counting the beats in your pulse for six seconds. Multiply by 10 to get beats per minute.\\n\\nTHE BEST VERSACLIMBER WORKOUT WORKOUT #90 BY HARRY CLAY\\n\\nA sk a U F C fighter w hat he fears most and he w on’t name an\\n\\nopponent.

Land on the balls of your feet as you sprint, not your heels. Your front foot should land directly beneath you (unless the hill is especially steep). Your arms should pump vigorously forward and backward as you run. Let your hands come up to face level and then back to your pockets, but no further.

A pair like chest and shoulders w ould not w ork because it inv olv es the\\n\\nsame muscles and w ill fatigue y ou too fast.\\n\\nChoose an exercise for each body part and a weight that allows you 10–12 reps for each. Begin alternating sets of the two moves, resting as little as possible between sets. Go a few reps short of failure on every set. Continue until 30 minutes is up. Make note of the rest periods you took between sets and the total number of reps you performed. The next time you repeat the\\n\\nworkout, try to improve your performance without extending the time frame.

We’re busy ladies, so if we can get more bang for our buck with quick workouts, sign us up!\\n\\nHere, we share a four-minute thigh routine you can do daily. But don’t be fooled — just because it’s short doesn’t mean it should be easy. Quality is better than quantity, so focus on form, add a dumbbell if bodyweight is a bit too easy, and get to work.\\n\\n1. Side squats\\n\\nSquats are a girl’s best friend — they work your legs and your booty. Add in the side step and you’ll feel an extra burn in your thighs and hips.\\n\\nEquipment needed: a small dumbbell or weight if you need a challenge\\n\\nStand up straight with your legs shoulder-width apart and arms at your side (or holding a weight to your chest).\\n\\nStep to the right, and as you do so, sit back into a squat, raising your arms to a comfortable position in front of you if just using your bodyweight.\\n\\nRise and return to standing in center. Repeat on the left side.\\n\\nComplete 1 round for 1 minute.\\n\\n2. Plié leg lift\\n\\nIf you’ve ever done ballet, you know it’s killer on the thighs — that’s why we stole this dance-inspired move from a barre workout!\\n\\nEquipment needed: none\\n\\nStart in a plié squat position, hands on your sides. Toes should be pointed out, feet wider than shoulder-width apart and knees slightly bent.\\n\\nSquat down, pushing you hips back, and on your way up, lift the right leg up into the air at your side. Go as high as is comfortable. Safely return to the starting position.\\n\\nRepeat the same steps, raising the left leg.\\n\\nComplete 1 round for 1 minute.\\n\\n3. Single-leg bridge\\n\\nNo thigh-toning routine is complete without a bridge, which strengthens your hamstrings, glutes, and core. To get the most out of this exercise, squeeze your cheeks when you reach the top, really forming a mind-body connection.\\n\\nEquipment needed: a mat, plus a small dumbbell or weight if you need a challenge\\n\\nStart lying face up on a mat, knees bent with feet on the floor and palms facing down at your sides.\\n\\nLift your right leg up off the ground and straighten it out in front of you while your left leg stays bent.\\n\\nPressing your left heel into the floor, lift your pelvis up toward the ceiling, squeezing at the top when you reach a stiff bridge position.\\n\\nSlowly lower back down to the ground and repeat for 30 seconds. Switch legs, and complete 30 seconds with the left leg up to round out this exercise.\\n\\n4. Scissor planks\\n\\nBy this point you should be getting a little tired, but the scissor plank will challenge you until the end!\\n\\nEquipment needed: hardwood floor, towel or slider for each foot\\n\\nStart in a plank position with towels or sliders positioned under each toe.\\n\\nBracing your core and upper body, slowly drag your feet apart as wide as they’ll go. Pause, then pull them back to center using your thigh muscles. Keep your hips square to the ground and your core tight.\\n\\nComplete 2 rounds of 30 seconds each.\\n\\nTakeaway\\n\\nFind a way to work this routine into your daily schedule and commit to push harder each time.

This is a great exercise to use as a warmup.\\n\\nDirections:\\n\\nLie on your back with your knees bent, feet flat on the floor, and your arms extended by your sides.\\n\\nPushing through your feet and bracing your core, raise your bottom off the ground until your hips are fully extended, squeezing your glutes at the top.\\n\\nSlowly return to the starting position and repeat.\\n\\nChair squat\\n\\nShare on Pinterest\\n\\nSquat to strengthen your legs and core, which will make everyday movements easier. Starting with a chair underneath you will help you master proper form.\\n\\nDirections:\\n\\nStand in front of the chair with your feet shoulder-width apart, toes pointed slightly out.\\n\\nHinging at your hips and bending your knees, lower back and down until your bottom touches the chair, allowing your arms to extend out in front of you.\\n\\nPush up through your heels and return to the starting position.\\n\\nKnee pushup\\n\\nShare on Pinterest\\n\\nA beginner-style pushup, this move will help you build strength before attempting a standard pushup.\\n\\nDirections:\\n\\nGet into a high plank position from your knees.\\n\\nMaintaining a straight line from your head to your knees, bend your elbows to lower yourself down to the ground. Keep your elbows at a 45-degree angle.\\n\\nPush back up to start.\\n\\nStationary lunge\\n\\nShare on Pinterest\\n\\nHit your quads, hamstrings, and glutes with a stationary lunge.\\n\\nDirections:\\n\\nSplit your stance with your right leg in front. Your right foot should be flat on the ground, and your left foot should be up on its toes.\\n\\nBend your knees and lunge, stopping when your right thigh is parallel to the ground.\\n\\nPush up through your right foot to return to the starting position. Repeat for desired number of reps, then switch legs.\\n\\nPlank to Downward Dog\\n\\nShare on Pinterest\\n\\nThis move will test your upper body, especially your shoulders. Who says you need weights for a shoulder workout?\\n\\nDirections:\\n\\nGet into a high plank position, with your hands stacked underneath your shoulders and your feet close together.\\n\\nKeeping your core engaged and your hands and feet stationary, pike your hips up and back into the Downward Dog pose. Your body should form a triangle with the ground. Keep your neck neutral. Your gaze should be directed toward your feet.\\n\\nHold here for a second, then return to the plank. Repeat.\\n\\nStraight-leg donkey kick\\n\\nShare on Pinterest\\n\\nBuild those glutes with donkey kicks.\\n\\nDirections:\\n\\nGet on all fours, with your hands aligned with your shoulders and your knees aligned with your hips.\\n\\nKeeping your back straight, push your right foot out to the imaginary wall behind you while keeping your leg straight.\\n\\nYour foot should remain flexed (toes pointing down to the floor) throughout. Take care to keep your hips square to the ground. Squeeze your buttocks at the top.\\n\\nReturn to the starting position. Repeat for the desired number of reps. Repeat on the other leg.\\n\\nBird Dog\\n\\nShare on Pinterest\\n\\nA full-body move that requires balance and stability, the Bird Dog pose is easily scalable to your ability level. Start with this version if you’re a beginner.\\n\\nDirections:\\n\\nGet on all fours, ensuring your hands are directly underneath your shoulders and your knees are underneath your hips.\\n\\nKeeping your neck neutral, simultaneously extend your left arm and right leg, keeping your hips square to the ground. Pause here for 2 seconds.\\n\\nReturn to the start position. Repeat with your right arm and left leg.\\n\\nForearm plank\\n\\nShare on Pinterest\\n\\nA full-body exercise that requires strength and balance, planks put the core into overdrive.\\n\\nDirections:\\n\\nAssume a plank position on your forearms. Your body should form a straight line from head to feet.\\n\\nEnsure your lower back and hips don’t sag. Hold the position for 30 seconds to 1 minute.\\n\\nSide-lying hip abduction\\n\\nShare on Pinterest\\n\\nYou may not think about strengthening your hip muscles until they start to bother you, but please reconsider!\\n\\nThis is especially the case if you sit all day. Counteracting that with hip-targeting movements will be very beneficial.\\n\\nDirections:\\n\\nLie on your left side, with your left leg straight, right leg straight, and right foot resting on the ground.\\n\\nLift your right leg up, maintaining the position of your body. Make sure your hips don’t open up.\\n\\nReturn to the start position. Repeat for the desired number of reps, then do the other side.\\n\\nBicycle crunch\\n\\nShare on Pinterest\\n\\nAlthough you’ll work your core with almost all of these strength exercises, a targeted ab move doesn’t hurt.\\n\\nDirections:\\n\\nLie on your back and bring your legs to a tabletop position. Bend your elbows, and put your hands behind your head.\\n\\nCrunch up and bring your right elbow to your left knee, straightening your right leg.\\n\\nRelease the crunch slightly. Bend your right leg and straighten your left leg, then bring your left elbow to your right knee.\\n\\nRepeat for the desired number of reps.\\n\\nIntermediate routine\\n\\nIf you’ve mastered the beginner routine, you’re ready to take on these intermediate moves.\\n\\nComplete 2 sets of 10 to 15 reps of each exercise below, then move on to the next after 1 minute of rest.\\n\\nAn alternative, more advanced approach is to complete timed rounds. For instance, complete 1 minute of each exercise and repeat the circuit twice.\\n\\nCompete against yourself to get just 1 or 2 more reps each time you complete the routine.\\n\\nSingle-leg bridge\\n\\nAny time you take an exercise to a single leg, you’ll automatically make it harder.\\n\\nHere, follow the steps for a bridge, but lift one foot off the ground while keeping your leg bent for an intermediate challenge.\\n\\nComplete the same number of reps on each side.\\n\\nSquat\\n\\nTaking out the chair allows you to master the form of a regular bodyweight squat.\\n\\nThe same motion is still applicable here, though. Imagine you’re sitting down in a chair by hinging at the hips and pushing your bottom back.\\n\\nPushup\\n\\nA standard pushup is the more challenging version of a knee pushup. Assume a high plank position and complete the pushup in the same way, allowing your elbows to flare out at a 45-degree angle.\\n\\nWalking lunge\\n\\nBy traveling instead of staying stationary in a lunge, you’ll add aspects of stability, mobility, and balance.\\n\\nStart with your feet together and step forward, lunging with your right leg. Stand up, then repeat with your left leg.\\n\\nPike pushups\\n\\nAdding a pushup to your pike will target those shoulders even more. The movement here is all in the arms, so keep the rest of your body stable.\\n\\nTo perform, assume a pike position and bend at the elbows — allowing them to flare out to the sides — directing the top of your head toward the ground.\\n\\nGet-up squat\\n\\nGet-up squats are great for time under tension, or keeping your legs and glutes under continuous work, which adds to the burn.\\n\\nDirections:\\n\\nDrop down into a squat position. You won’t stand at all during this move.\\n\\nDrop your knees down to the ground one at a time so you’re kneeling.\\n\\nStep your feet back to the ground one at a time, maintaining that squat position.\\n\\nRepeat as quickly as you can while maintaining good form.\\n\\nSuperman\\n\\nWork your lower back — and the whole backside of your body — with a superman. Go as slowly as you can here to really reap the benefits of this move.\\n\\nDirections:\\n\\nLie on your stomach, arms and legs extended.\\n\\nKeeping your neck neutral, recruit your core and the back of your body to simultaneously raise your arms and legs up and off the ground as high as they’ll go.\\n\\nPause for 1 second at the top, and slowly lower back to the start position.\\n\\nPlank with alternating leg lift\\n\\nAdding a leg lift to a regular plank makes you unstable, requiring your core to work in overdrive and your three limbs to support more weight.\\n\\nLift one leg up, hold for 5 seconds, and return it to the ground. Repeat with the other leg.\\n\\nKneeling side plank with hip abduction\\n\\nHolding your body up with your knee and your extended arm during a hip abduction makes this move an upper body exercise, too. Plus, it recruits the core even more.\\n\\nTo perform, assume a kneeling side plank, then lift the free leg up, pause, and lower it back down. Repeat on both sides.\\n\\nDead bug\\n\\nActivate those deep core muscles with a dead bug.\\n\\nDirections:\\n\\nStart lying on your back, legs at tabletop, and arms extended in front of you.\\n\\nIn a coordinated motion, extend your left leg and drop your right arm above your head, taking care that your lower back stays flat to the ground.\\n\\nBring your leg back to tabletop and your arm in front of you, then repeat with the opposite arm and leg.\\n\\nAdvanced routine\\n\\nWhen the intermediate routine becomes a breeze, take a stab at these advanced moves.\\n\\nBridge with leg extended\\n\\nLifting the foot then extending the leg straight out will make a single-leg bridge even more difficult.\\n\\nKeep your foot flexed throughout the movement. Complete the same number of reps on both legs.\\n\\nOverhead squat\\n\\nExtending your arms overhead will challenge your mobility and range of motion in your upper body, as well as give your lower body the benefits of a squat.\\n\\nTo perform, complete a squat with your arms extended overhead throughout.\\n\\nOne-legged pushup\\n\\nLifting one leg will again put more weight into your other three limbs, thus creating more of a challenge.\\n\\nTo get it done, assume a pushup position and lift one leg off the ground, then complete the pushup.\\n\\nJumping lunges\\n\\nJumping exercises — often known as plyometrics — require you to give it your max effort for a short interval of time.\\n\\nBecause of the power and strength they require, you’ll feel the burn quickly.\\n\\nAdd a jump to your lunge, really exploding up in each rep, to challenge yourself.\\n\\nElevated pike pushups\\n\\nElevating your feet in a pike pushup will make this version the hardest.\\n\\nPut your feet on an elevated surface, like a bench or a step, and complete an elevated pike pushup.\\n\\nThe higher the surface, the more challenging it will be.\\n\\nGet-up squat with jump\\n\\nInstead of stepping your feet back up from kneeling, jump them. You’ll need lots of power and strength for this move.\\n\\nAdvanced Bird Dog\\n\\nGet into a high plank position, then complete a Bird Dog, lifting one arm and the opposite leg simultaneously.\\n\\nAs with all advanced exercises, maintaining a straight spine is key here.\\n\\nOne-leg or one-arm plank\\n\\nLifting one arm or one leg — and holding it there — will take a plank up a notch. Hold for as many seconds as you can, then switch sides.\\n\\nOne leg will be more challenging than one arm, so choose the right version for you.\\n\\nSide plank with hip abduction\\n\\nPlank off your foot instead of your knee for a full-body challenge in this hip abduction.\\n\\nTo perform, assume a side plank, then perform a leg lift. Repeat on both sides.\\n\\nHollow hold to jackknife\\n\\nThis move requires you to contract your abs throughout.\\n\\nDirections:\\n\\nGet into a hollow hold position: Lie on your back and extend your arms above your head. Engage your core, lift your legs and upper body off the floor, and hold them there.\\n\\nAdd in a jackknife: Crunch up, bringing your arms overhead toward your toes and your legs toward the center of your body.\\n\\nSlowly release back to the jackknife position and repeat.\\n\\nThe bottom line\\n\\nBodyweight exercises will make your at-home workout challenging no matter your fitness level. Start with our beginner routine, and in just a matter of months, you could be well on your way to mastering the advanced routine.

It doesn’t have to be much though, give it about five minutes to get your muscles active and your heart rate up.\\n\\nThis will help you do exercises properly and help prevent injury. You can run in place, do air punches and kicks, or some jumping jacks.\\n\\nHere is NF Senior Coach Staci (you might know her incredible story) showing you many beginner options you can use to warm up as well:\\n\\nIf you’re curious, here’s my personal (advanced) warm-up:\\n\\nAdvanced Warm-up Routine:\\n\\nJump rope: 2-3 minutes\\n\\nJumping jacks: 25 reps\\n\\nBodyweight squats: 20 reps\\n\\nLunges: 5 reps each leg.\\n\\nHip extensions: 10 reps each side\\n\\nHip rotations: 5 each leg\\n\\nForward leg swings: 10 each leg\\n\\nSide leg swings: 10 each leg\\n\\nPush-ups: 10-20 reps\\n\\nSpider-man steps: 10 reps\\n\\nOur goal isn’t to tire you out, instead we want to warm you up.\\n\\nThat’s step one.\\n\\nCompleting your chosen at-home workout would be step two.\\n\\nBelow, you’ll find 8 sequences you can follow along with!\\n\\nHome Workout #1: Beginner Bodyweight\\n\\nThis at-home routine, as we lay out in our Beginner Bodyweight Workout article, is as follows:\\n\\nBodyweight squats: 20 reps\\n\\nPush-ups: 10 reps\\n\\nWalking lunges: 10 each leg\\n\\nDumbbell rows (using a gallon milk jug or another weight): 10 each arm.\\n\\nPlank: 15 seconds\\n\\nJumping Jacks: 30 reps\\n\\nWe also turned it into a fun infographic with superheroes, because that’s how we roll:\\n\\nThe above is what we call “circuit training,” with the objective being to run through the workout sequence once, then again, then again.\\n\\nNote: Not a milk drinker?\\n\\nIf you don’t have milk in the house for the rows, find something of roughly the same weight with a good handle.\\n\\nAlso, if you want to download this Beginner Bodyweight Workout as a worksheet, you can do so when you sign up in the box below:\\n\\nGrab Your Beginner Bodyweight Routine Worksheet. No Gym Required!\\n\\nComplete this workout at home, no equipment required\\n\\nAvoid the common mistakes everybody makes when doing bodyweight exercises\\n\\nLearn how to finally get your first pull-up\\n\\nIt’ll help you track your progress as you begin your training.\\n\\nHome Workout #2: Advanced Bodyweight\\n\\nIf the beginner at-home workout above is too easy for you, move on to our Advanced Bodyweight Workout.\\n\\nThe Advanced Bodyweight Workout:\\n\\nOne-legged squats – 10 each side [warning: super-difficult, only attempt if you’re in good enough shape]\\n\\nBodyweight squats: 20 reps\\n\\nWalking lunges: 20 reps (10 each leg)\\n\\nJump step-ups: 20 reps (10 each leg)\\n\\nPull-ups: 10 reps [or inverted bodyweight rows]\\n\\nDips (between bar stools): 10 reps\\n\\nChin-ups: 10 reps [or inverted bodyweight rows with underhand grip]\\n\\nPush-ups: 10 reps\\n\\nPlank: 30 seconds\\n\\nNot familiar with these moves?

Maybe you can find the hotel gym, but I bet it’s terrible! It probably has 2 machines, a broken treadmill, and no free weights.\\n\\nUgh.\\n\\nInstead, how about a 20-min workout you can do in the room itself! Utilize the furniture to its full potential.\\n\\nHotel Workout Level 1:\\n\\nBodyweight squats: 20 reps\\n\\nIncline push-ups: 15 reps (feet on floor, hands on edge of bed or desk)\\n\\nOne-arm luggage rows: 10 reps (each arm, use your suitcase as your weight)\\n\\nReverse crunches: 10 reps\\n\\nHotel Workout Level 2:\\n\\nOverhead Squats: 25 reps\\n\\nPush-Ups: 20 reps\\n\\nInverted Rows using the desk in your hotel room: 10 reps\\n\\nReverse Crunches: 15 reps\\n\\nSet the alarm clock to 15 minutes from now and see how many circuits you can do!\\n\\nCheck out our full post on hotel circuits if you want Level 3!\\n\\nWe have a LOT of business travelers throughout the Rebellion!

You can do a complete routine right in your own home!\\n\\nHIIT is just following a specific regimen where you vary your speeds and intensity throughout a shorter run, swim, bike, or row.\\n\\nUnless you have a giant backyard, running at home might be tough.\\n\\nBut you know what doesn’t require a lot of room?\\n\\nBurpees!\\n\\nTo complete a burpee:\\n\\nStart standing up, then squat down and kick your legs out.\\n\\nDo a push-up, bring your legs back in, and explode up into a jump.\\n\\nFor a HIIT workout, try to do 20 repetitions, then rest for two minutes.\\n\\nRepeat until you hate yourself.\\n\\nCheck out our full guide on How to Start Interval Training for some more ideas on HIIT workouts.\\n\\nYou can also check out our post “The 20-Min HIIT Workout for Home” for another living-room-friendly interval routine!\\n\\nHome Workout #5: Attack of the Angry Birds\\n\\nThe Angry Birds Workout is designed to be done when you have 5 or 10 minutes to kill.\\n\\nSort of like playing Angry Birds…\\n\\nHere’s how The Angry Birds Workout Plan works: it’s deceptively simple – only four major movements.\\n\\nBodyweight squats\\n\\nPush-ups\\n\\nPull-ups (or inverted rows)\\n\\nPlanks\\n\\nIf you don’t have time to run through the whole sequence, no problem!\\n\\nDepending on how much time you have during the day, you can do your whole workout at once, or break up your training into four different sessions throughout the day (with each session being ONE of the exercises).\\n\\nHere’s a sample day for your No-Equipment Workout:\\n\\nWake up, do 40 jumping jacks to warm up, and then do bodyweight squats.\\n\\nAt lunch, you grab your suitcase (if you’re at work, milk jug if you’re at home) and do inverted rows.\\n\\nAfter work, you do another 50 jumping jacks and then do your push-ups.\\n\\nAfter dinner, you do your planks while watching TV.\\n\\nYou could even split it up over two days if needed, but the goal would be to do it the whole sequence at once.\\n\\nThe main Angry Birds Workout article describes in detail Levels 1-6, but here’s Level 3 for you:\\n\\nBodyweight squats: 50 reps\\n\\nPush-ups: 50 reps\\n\\nPull-ups: 10 reps\\n\\nPlanks: 3-minute hold\\n\\nOnce you’ve done the complete routine, you have my permission to whip out your phone and play the actual game!\\n\\nHome Workout #6: Train like Batman\\n\\nWe love the Caped Crusader here at Nerd Fitness, so naturally we have The Batman Bodyweight Workout for you to try!\\n\\nBonus points if you somehow do this no-equipment workout in a cave, as that’s how Bruce Wayne would roll.[1]\\n\\nThis workout is separated into two days for you.\\n\\nHere’s a video for the first day:\\n\\nBatman No-Equipment Workout Day 1:\\n\\nRolling squat tuck-up jumps: 5 reps\\n\\nSide to side push-ups: 5 reps\\n\\nModified headstand push-ups: 5 reps\\n\\nJump pull-up with tuck / Pull-up with Tuck-up: 5 reps\\n\\nHandstands against wall: 8 seconds\\n\\nHere’s a video for the second day:\\n\\nBatman No-Equipment Workout Day 2:\\n\\n‘180 Degree’ jump turns: 5 reps\\n\\nTuck front lever hold: 8 seconds\\n\\nTuck back lever hold: 8 seconds\\n\\nLow frog hold: 8 seconds\\n\\nThis is a relatively advanced workout already, but if you want to progress to the next level, check out the main Batman Bodyweight Workout for tips on how to do just that.\\n\\nJoin our free weekly newsletter! It would make Alfred Pennyworth proud.\\n\\nHome Workout #7: The PLP Progression\\n\\nThe PLP is a progressive program in which you complete one additional rep of three exercises – Pull-Ups, Lunges, and Push-Ups – every day, for two months.\\n\\nNOTE: This is NOT a beginner program, and should not be attempted unless you have been training consistently and can do multiple repetitions of pull-ups and push-ups with great form.\\n\\nLike this perfect push-up:\\n\\nAnd this perfect pull-up:\\n\\nHere’s how the PLP Progression works:\\n\\nDay 1:\\n\\nPull-ups: 10 reps\\n\\nPush-ups: 10 reps\\n\\nLunges: 10 reps (each leg)\\n\\nDay 2:\\n\\nPull-ups: 11 reps\\n\\nPush-ups: 11 reps\\n\\nLunges: 11 reps (each leg)\\n\\nDay 3:\\n\\nPull-ups: 12 reps\\n\\nPush-ups: 12 reps\\n\\nLunges: 12 reps (each leg)\\n\\nHow long do you keep doing this?\\n\\nAs originally envisioned by Chad Waterbury, the PLP Workout lasts 60 days.[3]\\n\\nYeah…by the end of it you’ll be doing more than 50 pull-ups.\\n\\nThere are two versions:\\n\\nIf you can do 10 straight pull-ups: Start day 1 with 10 reps of each.\\n\\nIf you cannot do 10 straight pull-ups: Start day 1 with 1 rep of each.\\n\\nComplete your required reps each day in as many sets as you need, whenever you need to. The goal is to do it in as few sets as possible, but enough so that you can complete each rep with proper form.\\n\\nWant to learn more? Check out my results on the PLP Workout.\\n\\nHome Workout #8: The Star Wars Workout!\\n\\nDo you have access to a hallway that you can commandeer for a bit?\\n\\nThen you can do our Star Wars Workout!\\n\\nIt’s designed to be done in a very small space, like your home’s hallway…or an escape pod.\\n\\nThe “Padawan” Level of this workout is:\\n\\n30-second knee or feet front plank (3 Sets)\\n\\n10 assisted squats or squats (3 Sets)\\n\\n10 doorway rows (3 Sets)\\n\\nA 60-second Farmer-carry (Farmer’s Walk) dumbbells (or milk jugs) (2 sets)\\n\\nMarch in place for 3 minutes of intervals (6 sets of 20 seconds on, 10 seconds off)\\n\\n8 elevated or knee push-ups (4 sets)\\n\\n60-second Doorway Leans (2 sets)\\n\\nIf you want to advance to the Jedi Knight or Master Levels, check out The Star Wars Workout, which will also offer you a full description of each move.\\n\\nBonus No-Equipment Workout: The Playground Circuit\\n\\nDo you have a nearby playground? Why not work out there! If you have kids, you can do it together. Or let them ignore you.\\n\\nI’ll give you a Level One workout, and a Level Two. Check out The 20-Minute Playground Workout for some Level Three exercises.\\n\\nPlayground Workout Level One:\\n\\nAlternating step-ups: 20 reps (10 each leg)\\n\\nElevated push-ups: 10 reps\\n\\nSwing rows: 10 reps\\n\\nAssisted lunges: 8 reps each leg\\n\\nBent leg reverse crunches: 10 reps\\n\\nPlayground Workout Level Two:\\n\\nBench jumps: 10 reps\\n\\nLower incline push-ups: 10 reps\\n\\nBody rows: 10 reps\\n\\nLunges: 8 reps each leg\\n\\nStraight leg reverse crunches: 10 reps\\n\\nAfter you’ve gone through a complete set three times, go down the slide!\\n\\nWorking out doesn’t have to suck...we know how to make it fun! Join the Rebellion to become part of our community!\\n\\nCan Home Workouts Build Muscle or Help With Weight Loss?\\n\\nThroughout our Online Coaching Program, we get two common questions for those wanting to train at home:\\n\\nCan working out at home help me build muscle?\\n\\nCan working out at home help me lose weight?\\n\\nThe answer to both of these: yep!\\n\\nLet’s tackle them one by one.\\n\\n#1) Can working out at home help me build muscle?\\n\\nYou can 100% build muscle mass at home.\\n\\nJust ask out friend Jimmy here:\\n\\nRead more on how Jimmy turned into Spider-Man from home!\\n\\nThe trick is to follow a progressive overload strategy, as Coach Jim outlines in this video:\\n\\nWith progressive overload, we want to make our workouts more and more challenging, thus putting additional strain on our muscles.\\n\\nSo to build muscle with home workouts, focus on:\\n\\nIncreasing your repetitions.\\n\\nDecreasing your rest periods between exercises.\\n\\nPerforming more difficult variations (knee push-ups to push-ups).\\n\\nIncreasing your time under tension (by going slower).\\n\\nThat will help you build strength and muscle from your casa.\\n\\nNext up:\\n\\n#2) Can working out at home help me lose weight?\\n\\nYou can totally train at home for a successful weight loss strategy.\\n\\nAgain, we have a great example with one of our Online Coaching Clients, Sarah the Supermom:\\n\\nThe trick here is to couple your home workouts with adjustments to your nutrition.\\n\\nWe’re big believers that you can’t outrun your fork, so any successful weight loss plan will include a focus on building a healthy plate.\\n\\nThat will look something like this:\\n\\nIf you want some help on adjusting your nutrition, I’ve got two great resources for you:\\n\\nThe Nerd Fitness Guide to Healthy Eating. This massive resource will help you slowly adjust your nutrition, without forcing you to give up the food you love (yes, you can still eat pizza here and there).
