So how can one mere book possibly give you all of that?\\n\\nBecause this book is unlike any other fitness book ever created. Because no matter who you are, what you want, or where you happen to be standing right at this moment, the world’s greatest workout—the greatest workout for you—is now at your fingertips.\\n\\nYou see, just walking into a gym doesn’t guarantee you a great workout. It’s a lot like walking into a supermarket. Just because you fill your shopping cart with lots of great food doesn’t mean you know how to whip up a great meal. Cook all of those foods too fast, too long, or in the wrong combinations and even the freshest, most expensive\\n\\ningredients turn into slop.\\n\\nThe same thing happens in the gym: There are dozens of\\n\\nshiny machines and piles of free weights, and literally thousands of things you can do with them to build muscle and burn fat. But simply having access to a lot of equipment doesn’t mean you’ll know how to craft a great workout—one that will maximize your gains and minimize the time you spend reaching them.\\n\\nIf you’ve ever been frustrated by fitness plans in the past—or found yourself dropping out because of a lack of results, a lack of time, or because your routine called for equipment that wasn’t available on a regular basis, this book is for you. If you want to see progress immediately and feel yourself getting stronger and leaner by the day, this book is for you. If you want to take the gains you’ve reached and turbocharge them, this book is for you. If you want the perfect workout for the time you have, the equipment you have, and the goals you have, this book is for you.\\n\\nAnd most important: If you want total confidence that\\n\\nthe workout you’re doing is the absolute best possible workout, bar none, this book is for you.\\n\\nUnlike other exercise books that give you unyielding\\n\\nsystems incapable of adapting to time or equipment constraints, or that simply list hundreds of exercises but don’t tell you how to meld them into a cohesive workout, this book is different. Like a Swiss Army knife, it’s a multifaceted tool that adapts to provide you with the results you want, no matter the circumstances.\\n\\nAs the editorial director of Men’s Fitness, and the health\\n\\nand wellness editor of ABC News, I’ve tried just about every exercise plan ever created. I’ve lifted fast, I’ve lifted slow; I’ve lifted heavy, I’ve lifted light; I’ve run marathons and I’ve done wind sprints. (Although I have not, and will not, Zumba.) And I’ve spent more than 20 years reading studies and theories on building muscle, burning fat, and boosting endurance.\\n\\nBut what makes me excited about this book—what makes it so different from other exercise guides on the market—is that it guarantees you the absolute best workout no matter where you find yourself, what your goals are, or what equipment you have.\\n\\nWant the ultimate full-body fat-burning workout for the\\n\\ngym? It’s in here.\\n\\nWant the absolute best upper-body workout but have\\n\\naccess only to a pair of dumbbells? You’re covered.\\n\\nWant to shred your abs but have nothing but a pair of\\n\\ncross-trainers and a jogging trail? You’ve got the plan. Want to build muscle even while you’re trapped in a motel room or the world’s lamest hotel gym? This book takes every circumstance into consideration and gives you only the best.\\n\\nI know how good the workouts are in here because I know the team that built them: Sean Hyson, C.S.C.S., has been designing and editing workouts for the readers of Men’s Fitness and Muscle & Fitness for more than 10 years; he may well be the most knowledgeable fitness editor in the business. And I know how good the workouts are because I’ve done them myself—and they have kicked my ass. I’ve been astounded by the results!\\n\\nNow it’s time for you to build muscle, burn fat, and get into the greatest shape of your life in record time—all the while knowing that no matter where you are, no matter what equipment you have, the workout you’re doing is the absolute best workout for you, with the absolute maximum return on investment.\\n\\nGet ready to start winning.\\n\\nDavid Zinczenko\\n\\nIntroduction\\n\\nBe your best, wherever, whenever If you’re reading this book, you already appreciate the importance of working out. You know that without a regular training routine you’re not going to be your best— and let’s face it, being successful at this thing called life means constant striving to become the best you can be.\\n\\nOf course, when it comes to training—like most\\n\\neverything else in life—sometimes circumstances seem to conspire to keep you from working out. Maybe you’ll find yourself on the road without access to a gym or with access to only a really lame one. Or you might be in a situation where the only training equipment at your disposal is a TRX system, bands, or even less. Or maybe you have all the equipment you need but could use a different routine—one that shakes your body out of the complacency that results from sticking with a good thing for too long. You want to be your best, but sometimes that means making the best of a bad situation. Now, thanks to this book, you can always get a great workout—no matter where you are.\\n\\nConsider this a kind of Rosetta stone for training. No matter what kind of equipment you have (or lack thereof), or your degree of training experience, we’ve got a workout for you. In fact, we’ve got 101 of them. Your surroundings will never limit your routine again, with routines for\\n\\nbarbells, dumbbells, and even just one dumbbell. You’ll find routines that utilize suspension trainers, exercise bands, medicine balls, Swiss balls, or nothing but your body weight alone. And you’ll get to handpick from workouts that target the whole body or a program that focuses on body parts individually, along with specific workouts for the upper body and lower body. Plus, we’ve included routines for every cardio machine imaginable.\\n\\nWith this book, the coast is clear for you to get bigger, stronger, and leaner than ever, sculpting the body you’ve always wanted, regardless of your resources.\\n\\nNow, like most everything, this book has an upside and a downside. On the upside, you now have a resource that covers all your workout needs under every conceivable circumstance. The question “What kind of workout should I do?” has been answered forever. On the downside, you have no more excuses. You can’t skip sessions because you’re on the road and your hotel has a crappy, antiquated, little gym or no gym at all. Hell, you don’t even have an excuse to skip a workout if you’re lost in the arctic tundra (see this page)! You also can no longer say that you don’t have time to train, because some of these workouts require less time than an average water-cooler conversation (there’s a dedicated section of short workouts ranging from 30 minutes down to only four). This body-carving tome will fast-track your gains and\\n\\nteach you how to upgrade your current routine easily, with an incredible array of body-challenging routines. One hundred one options is a surefire plateau buster.\\n\\nNearly as diverse as the workouts within these pages are\\n\\nthe fitness experts we’ve recruited to design them, providing you with a wealth of authoritative information that has stood the test of thousands of training clients. Yet because training is only half the equation of physique transformation, we’ve also got your nutrition needs covered. Our newly erected Men’s Fitness Food Pyramid provides you with a foundation for building muscle while losing fat, employing the simplest calculations and menu plan.\\n\\nSo, as of right now, you officially have no more\\n\\nlimitations to your training—at least when it comes to location, time, and equipment. And, for better or worse, that also means no more excuses. With this book, the world becomes your gym—one that’s open 24/7, 365 days —with everything you need to build loads of quality muscle. Take advantage of your membership today and you’re guaranteed to look and feel your best for a lifetime to come.\\n\\n01 THE MEN’S FITNESS FOOD PYRAMID\\n\\nRemember the USDA Food Pyramid? The one that was posted by the lunch line in your grade school cafeteria and taught in health class? The government’s official position on how you should eat to be fit and healthy included recommendations to consume up to 11 servings of pasta, bread, and crackers per day; limit meat and eggs to three servings; and count potatoes as a vegetable.\\n\\nYeah, don’t eat like that.\\n\\nThe Food Pyramid was so misleading and inaccurate that in 2011 it was replaced with the USDA’s MyPlate, an improved but still flawed approach to fighting obesity. To be fair, the government’s nutrition advice is aimed at the average American who desires to be in only average shape (read: not obese). As we assume you picked up this book to be bigger, stronger, more ripped, and healthier than that, you need an entirely different approach.\\n\\nTo that end, we’ve created the Men’s Fitness Food Pyramid—an easy visual guide to eating for physique enhancement, performance, and optimal health. See how the pyramid works below and then use it to build a better body.\\n\\nHIT YOUR NUMBERS\\n\\nAs a physique-conscious eater, you need to think in terms of macronutrients as well as calories. Every food you eat gets counted toward a total target amount (in grams) of protein, carbs, and fat, which you can determine by multiplying the numbers in the Men’s Fitness Food Pyramid by your body weight in pounds. Hit these numbers and you’ll hit your goals.\\n\\nWith that said, your nutrition doesn’t need to be as\\n\\nprecise as target coordinates for a missile attack. You’ll do just fine eyeballing portions of protein, carbs, and fat (which we’ll show you how to do) and keeping a general tally.\\n\\nMAKE ADJUSTMENTS AS NECESSARY\\n\\nThe calorie and macronutrient recommendations here are just a starting point. Every trainee needs to find the proper amounts for his own body. If you’re not losing weight, reduce your carbs gradually, and try experimenting with bumping up your protein and fat intake a bit. If you feel as if you can’t gain weight, you can add more carbs and even more fat, which will increase your calories sharply. For any formulation you make, give it at least a week to take effect before you make any changes.\\n\\nThe M en’s F itness F ood P y ramid w as created w ith cooperation from the\\n\\nM en’s F itness N utrition A dv isory Board.

It includes John M eadow s, C .S .S .N .;\\n\\nN ate M iy aki, C .S .S .N .; C hris M ohr, P h.D.; and S helby S tarnes.\\n\\nPROTEIN\\n\\nWith protein being the main component of muscle tissue, your intake of it must remain high no matter your goal. To make size gains, you need at least one gram of protein per pound of your body weight to support optimal growth. When dieting, you must create a caloric deficit—but that can cause muscle loss if you end up cutting protein to do it. That’s why we increase protein intake and decrease starchy carbs. To get lean, you may increase your protein to as many as 1.5 grams per pound of body weight; but start lower and increase gradually as you reduce your calories slowly. If you feel like you’re not recovering from training or you’re losing muscle, up the protein fast.\\n\\nThe best protein sources are eggs, chicken, fish, lean beef, turkey, quinoa (for vegetarians), and protein powder. A three-ounce portion of lean meat or fish is about the size and thickness of the palm of your hand and contains 20–25 grams of protein, five grams of fat or fewer, and zero carbs.\\n\\nCARBS\\n\\nAll carbohydrates break down into glucose, raising your blood sugar levels faster than any other nutrient. As a result, the pancreas releases insulin to remove surplus sugar from the bloodstream and maintain normal levels. Research, including a study at the University of Washington School of Medicine, has found that exercise— particularly strength training—increases insulin sensitivity in the muscles. So if you’ve just worked out, more of the\\n\\ncarbs you eat afterward will be carried by insulin directly to your muscles for replenishment. (Incidentally, this goes for protein too, which is why it’s helpful to consume a mixture of protein and carbs after training—we’ll discuss this more later.) On the other hand, if you’ve been sitting on the couch watching football, those carbs will just get stored around your waist.\\n\\nFor this reason, we recommend that most of your carbs\\n\\ncome before, during, and shortly after training. It also means that you need to eat fewer carbs when you want to get lean—you need to keep insulin levels low. “If someone is in fat-loss mode,” says John Meadows, C.S.S.N., a nutrition coach and national-level bodybuilder, “I like to limit carbs to pre-, intra-, and post-workout meals, when they’ll go where you want them”—that is, to muscle tissue. For muscle gain, Meadows prefers to add carbs (shakes included) to meals around training time first, before adding them to other meals.\\n\\nCarb foods include potatoes, sweet potatoes, rice, oats, fruits, and vegetables. Fruits should be consumed in their whole-food form and limited to two or three pieces daily (excess fructose, the sugar in fruit, is stored as fat). Green vegetables can be eaten steadily regardless of the goal. Eat one gram of carbohydrate per pound of your body weight when dieting and two grams per pound when you want to put on muscle.\\n\\nA fist-size portion of cooked rice or potatoes is about\\n\\none cup and gives you 40–45 grams of carbs and negligible protein and fat.\\n\\nFAT\\n\\n“We need to provide a baseline level of good fats for hormone production,” says Nate Miyaki, C.S.S.N., a nutrition consultant and bodybuilder in San Francisco, CA. Fat, particularly the much-maligned saturated kind, helps in the creation of testosterone, which does everything from getting you big and lean to keeping your “little friend” ready to say hello. Contrary to popular opinion, when dieting, you don’t need to drop your fat intake much, if at all; fat loss comes fastest when carbohydrate intake is reduced. Plus, fat is satiating as well as a good source of energy.\\n\\nMost of your fats should come by way of your protein foods, but avocados, nuts, seeds, and a small amount of oil like coconut and olive oil can be included as well. Aim for 0.4 grams per pound of your body weight daily to start. One tablespoon of any oil is about 15 grams of fat, and one cup of almonds or peanuts has 70 grams of fat. Two tablespoons of nut butter is about the length of your thumb and contains 15–20 grams of fat.\\n\\nWORKOUT NUTRITION\\n\\nResearch hasn’t yet clarified the optimal amount of protein or carbs you should eat around workouts for the maximum benefit. But it is clear that some is better than none, and the presence of both is crucial. A 2006 study in the European Journal of Applied Physiology gave male subjects one of the following to consume after weight training: a 6 percent carbohydrate solution, six grams of\\n\\namino acids (components of protein), a combination of both, or a placebo. Those drinking the carb-and-aminos shake experienced greater muscle gains than any of the other groups, which the researchers presumed was because the concoction did the most to reduce muscle protein breakdown after training.\\n\\nMeadows recommends taking in 25–50 grams of\\n\\nprotein, 25–35 grams of carbs, and 10 grams of fat before training. Afterward, consume another 20–40 grams of protein and 40–80 grams of carbs—you can begin chugging this shake during the workout as well to limit muscle breakdown even further, though this may not be necessary and could upset your stomach. We like to make shakes with whey isolate or hydrolysate as the protein source, and Vitargo or highly branched cyclic dextrin for carbs.\\n\\nIf powders and shakes aren’t in your budget, Miyaki says you can go old-school and eat fruit pre- and post-workout. One or two pieces should provide enough carbs to halt muscle breakdown. And a lean three-ounce slice of protein to accompany it is fine.\\n\\nA PERFECT DAY How to plan your eating to achieve your goals\\n\\nLet’s say you’re a\\n\\n180 POUND MAN who wants to lose his gut.\\n\\nYou could start your diet eating about\\n\\n2,100 CALORIES DAILY (180 × 12)\\n\\nconsisting of 180g PROTEIN, 180g CARBS, and 70g FAT.\\n\\nHERE’S A LOW-STRESS EATING PLAN TO FIT THIS GUY’S BUSY SCHEDULE.\\n\\nBREAKFAST\\n\\n8 oz black coffee\\n\\n3 scrambled eggs\\n\\n1/3 cup unsweetened oatmeal with cinnamon\\n\\nPOST-WORKOUT\\n\\n25g whey protein\\n\\n1 banana\\n\\nLUNCH\\n\\n3 oz grilled salmon\\n\\nLarge raw salad w/ 2 tbsp olive oil and vinegar 1 cup sweet potato or white potato (cooked)\\n\\nDINNER\\n\\n6 oz baked chicken breast\\n\\n1 cup jasmine rice or potato (cooked)\\n\\nSteamed broccoli\\n\\nSNACK\\n\\nMeal-replacement shake with 50g protein, 25g carbs, 5g fat\\n\\nDESSERT\\n\\n2 tbsp almond butter mixed with one scoop chocolate casein protein and water (to make a pudding)\\n\\n02 HOW TO WARM UP\\n\\nWe’ll keep this brief. When you’re eager to work out, the last thing you want to do is slow your roll with a long warmup that has you flopping around the floor like a fish, draining your momentum. If you passed fifth grade P.E., you’ve already had it drilled into you that warming up is crucial and not to be skipped, so we’ll spare you the speech about howimportant it is. Instead of lecturing, we’ll give you some warmup options that get you sweating and ready to perform any of the workouts that follow, but also fit into the time you have and your level of patience—whatever the case may be. Most important is that you don’t start lifting heavy weights, jumping, or running totally cold, which common sense should tell you is an injury waiting to happen.\\n\\nOPTION 1 THE BEST WARMUP\\n\\nIf you have at least an hour in which to train, or a history of injuries that could otherwise impede your ability to train safely, your warmup should begin with foam rolling and include a wide array of dynamic exercises and static stretches.\\n\\nIf you’ve tried a foam roller after a tough workout, you were instantly aware of its ability to help relieve muscle aches and soreness. It also provides an easy way to start getting warmed up, as it promotes blood flow. Rest your muscles on the roller (a tennis ball, softball, or lacrosse ball work, too) and roll them out for about 30 seconds each. When you find a tender spot, hold the position until you feel it begin to release (or for as long as you can stand it). Pay extra attention to the hips, glutes, outer and inner thighs, lower back, calves, and lats. You can repeat the rolling after your workout as well if you like, as this may enhance recovery.\\n\\nA)\\n\\nB) fuzzy). This could be a set of 30 jumping jacks, a five- minute walk on the treadmill (set to a slight incline), or a\\n\\nPerform some light activity that elevates your heart rate and makes you feel warm (though not necessarily\\n\\nminute or two of jumping rope. Other cardio machines like a stationary bike or an elliptical machine can also get your blood flowing.\\n\\nNow you’ll begin what’s often called a dynamic C) warmup. In addition to encouraging further blood flow and higher body temperature, dynamic exercises take your muscles through the ranges of motion you’ll use in your workout, preparing you to get into those positions safely. There are endless options, but try this routine.\\n\\n1 SHOULDER OVER AND BACK\\n\\nPERFORM 15 REPS\\n\\nHold a band, dowel, yardstick, or light bar in front of your hips with hands outside shoulder width. Keeping your elbows straight, raise your arms overhead and behind your body as far as you can. Bring them back in front of you again. Continue going over and back and gradually narrow your grip as you feel your shoulders loosen up.\\n\\n2 HIP HINGE\\n\\nPERFORM 15 REPS\\n\\nPlace your hands on your hips and stand with feet hip width. Push your hips back, bending your knees only as needed, until you feel a stretch in your hamstrings. Squeeze your glutes as you forcefully push your hips forward again to stand up straight.\\n\\n3 OVERHEAD SQUAT\\n\\nPERFORM 10 REPS\\n\\nHold a band, dowel, yardstick, or light bar overhead with hands outside shoulder width. Stand with feet shoulder width and toes turned out slightly. Bend your hips back and squat as low as you can without letting your tailbone tuck under. Keep the object you’re holding above and slightly behind your head the whole time—don’t let it drift in front of you.\\n\\n4 SIDE LUNGE\\n\\nPERFORM 10 REPS ON EA CH LEG\\n\\nStand with feet hip width and step out to your left. Lower your body until your left knee is bent 90 degrees, or until you feel a stretch in the right side of your groin, but keep your right leg straight. Repeat on the right side.\\n\\n5 BENTOVER YTW\\n\\nPERFORM 8 REPS OF EA CH\\n\\nStand with feet shoulder width and bend your hips back, keeping your lower back flat, until your torso is about 45 degrees to the floor. Let your arms hang. Now squeeze your shoulder blades together and raise your arms up and out to your sides about 45 degrees to form a Y shape. Lower them and then raise them out to your sides 90 degrees to form a T. Lower and then raise them out to your sides, but bend your elbows 90 degrees to form a W.\\n\\n6 CAT/CAMEL\\n\\nPERFORM 10 REPS\\n\\nKneel on the floor with knees under your hips and hands beneath your shoulders. Arch your back so your chest rises—you should look like a cat stretching. Now round your entire back so it looks like a camel’s hump.\\n\\n7 BIRD DOG\\n\\nPERFORM 10 REPS ON EA CH SIDE\\n\\nFrom the kneeling position, extend your left hand out in front of you. Simultaneously kick your right leg back straight, bracing your core and squeezing your glutes as you do so. Hold for a moment and then switch legs.\\n\\n8 HIP CIRCLE\\n\\nMA KE 10 CLOCKWISE CIRCLES A ND THEN SWITCH LEGS; REPEA T ON BOTH LEGS IN THE COUNTERCLOCKWISE DIRECTION\\n\\nFrom the kneeling position, raise your right knee off the floor and make circles with it, opening your hip as much as possible on each revolution. Keep your shoulders square to the floor.\\n\\n9 GROINER\\n\\nPERFORM 10 REPS ON EA CH SIDE\\n\\nGet into pushup position with your hands shoulder width, feet close together, and body in a straight line. Jump your left foot forward and land it to the outside of your left hand. Let your hips sink a bit to feel the stretch and then reverse it—jump your left foot back while the right one comes up to your right hand.\\n\\nD)At this point, it’s wise to statically stretch muscles\\n\\nthat you know to be chronically tight. For most\\n\\npeople, the hips, glutes, and lats are bound up due to many hours sitting at desks in front of computers, but stretch whatever areas you feel need it most. Hold each stretch for 30 seconds and repeat for three sets on each side. The following are some suggestions.\\n\\nHIP FLEXOR STRETCH\\n\\nGet into lunge position on the floor with your right leg back. Place your hands on your hips and push your hips forward until you feel a stretch in your right hip. Squeeze your glutes on your right side. For a more intense stretch, reach your right arm overhead and lean back slightly while keeping your hips forward. Another progression is to reach back and grasp the outside of your rear foot and gently pull it off the floor. You’ll feel the stretch go into the top of your thigh.\\n\\nLAT STRETCH\\n\\nGrasp a sturdy upright object with your left hand, thumb facing up, and bend your hips back until your torso and arm are in line and you feel a stretch in your lat. Move gently from side to side so you stretch the entire muscle.\\n\\nPEC STRETCH\\n\\nPlace the meat of your right forearm against a sturdy upright object (a doorframe is perfect) and bend your elbow 90 degrees. Gently lean forward so you feel a stretch on your pec.\\n\\nPIRIFORMIS STRETCH\\n\\nSit on a bench and cross your left leg over your right knee, bending your left knee 90 degrees. Gently push your left knee down so you feel a stretch on the outside of your left glutes.\\n\\nCALF STRETCH\\n\\nPlace your hands against a wall and stagger your feet so one is close to the wall and your rear leg is straight. Both feet face forward and your rear leg should be aligned with your upper body. Lean forward until you feel your calf stretch on your trailing leg.\\n\\nOPTION 2 THE MEATHEAD’S WARMUP\\n\\nMost guys come into the gym and grasp the bar or a pair of dumbbells and do a light set of 15–20 reps. Then they go a little heavier and cut the reps down a bit. They’ll do one more set and, now that they’re sweating, figure they’re ready to go.\\n\\nWhile this is hardly the best way to prep your body, it does serve the purpose most of the time, assuming you’re not training too heavy. But take it a little slower and more deliberately, and you’ve got a more decent warmup routine for when you’re doing one of our lifting workouts and need to get done in a hurry.\\n\\nHere’s how to warm up for a heavy strength workout that begins with a barbell exercise. More accurately, this is called “working up” in powerlifting circles, because the goal is to gradually work your way up to using the heaviest weights possible. You start with the empty bar and perform 10–15 reps with perfect form and then add weight in moderate increments until you’re at the maximum load you plan to lift on the exercise.\\n\\nHere’s how it might look for a guy work ing up to a 275-pound squat\\n\\nfor fiv e reps:\\n\\nThere’s no exact formula for how to do this, so the weights and reps above aren’t mandatory, but the idea is to start very light, pump some blood into the working muscles and lubricate the joints, and then add weight steadily until you comfortably arrive at the heaviest load you can use for the target reps. The reps on these work-up sets are kept low (after the first set or two) because you need to conserve energy for the main effort, the work set. These sets also serve to reinforce good technique, so the form on the exercise is fresh in your mind and the body is in its groove to do it properly when you get to a challenging load.\\n\\nHow long should you rest between sets? Since work-up sets aren’t as taxing as your main work sets, you shouldn’t need to rest long. A minute or so will be fine for most until you get up to heavy weights, at which time you can rest longer.\\n\\nThere are a few tricks you can employ to make this process even more effective and make your top set even heavier, or at least feel easier. Try doing your last work-up set a little heavier than the main set, but only for one or two reps, so it’s not too strenuous. Then back down to the weight you intend to use for the work set.\\n\\nFor instance, if y ou’re going to perform a squat with 275 for fiv e, y our last four sets could look lik e this:\\n\\nIn other words, you gradually work up to an even heavier weight, reducing your reps to minimize fatigue, and then go back down to 275. The set with 300 might be way more than you can handle for five reps, but done for only one, it will feel relatively easy. By comparison, 275 will feel much easier when it’s done afterward. Obviously, this won’t work on super-heavy sets when your target reps are in the 1–3 range, but it’s great when they’re between 4 and 8.\\n\\nAnother trick, which we learned from Jason Ferruggia, a\\n\\nstrength coach in Los Angeles, CA, is to back the weight down for a set before you reach your target. This works well if you’re trying to hit a new max (one rep), which can be very intimidating. The weight tends to feel very heavy at around 90 percent of your max, and it can dissuade you from going any heavier. By going a bit lighter for a set and then working your way back up, you give your nervous system more time to adapt. The weight feels lighter, so you feel more confident, and the rest of the way up to your max weight goes smoother.\\n\\nSay y ou’re try ing to bench press 315 for the first time. Your last few sets could dev elop lik e this:\\n\\nTo be clear, working up is not optional. Because it can be time consuming, if you have time for only one kind of warmup, this should be it. But we strongly suggest that, whenever possible, you employ one of the other options we list here beforehand.\\n\\nIncidentally, working up applies to training with\\n\\nkettlebells/dumbbells, a suspension trainer, and bands as well. Start with light resistance, gradually tapering your reps as you up the intensity.\\n\\nOPTION 3 THE PRACTICAL WARMUP\\n\\nAs the name implies, this routine is for when you have time to warm up, but not enough to do everything listed in Option 1. In this case, you need to get a good sweat going and prepare your muscles and joints to move while doing the bare essentials.\\n\\nAccording to Ben Bruno, a celebrity trainer at Rise Movement in West Hollywood, CA, you should hit a cardio machine for five minutes followed by these stretches. “Do toe-touch squats and sumo squat holds (both of which are explained below) to improve mobility,” Bruno says.\\n\\nTOE-TOUCH SQUAT\\n\\nStand with feet shoulder width and toes turned slightly out. Reach down to touch your toes with legs extended and then bend your hips back to squat down, keeping your lower back in its natural arch. Now reach your hands overhead and come up.\\n\\nSUMO SQUAT HOLD\\n\\nStand with feet shoulder width and toes turned slightly out. Bend your hips back and squat down, keeping your lower back flat and reaching your hands to your toes in the bottom position. Hold the position for a few seconds and then use your elbows to push your knees farther apart so you can sink deeper into the squat.\\n\\nDID WE SAY THIS WOULD BE BRIEF?\\n\\nIn a nutshell, that’s all you need to know about warming up. Note that even if you’re doing a lower-body workout, it’s smart to include some upper-body warmup moves because the entire body is connected. Tightness or coldness in the upper torso can lead to injury when working the legs, and vice versa; so while you may abbreviate or recombine the warmup moves listed here, don’t ignore whole muscle areas just because you’re not training them that day. For the cardio routines beginning in chapter 26, you don’t need to do any more warming up than what is already built into the workouts.\\n\\n03 FULL GYM\\n\\nWe all love to bitch about our gyms. They don’t have enough benches, the machines are always broken, and so on. It’s only when we’re forced to train at home or in a hotel that we realize what a luxury even the most average commercial fitness center is.\\n\\nIf you’re lucky enough to have a membership to a training facility, this chapter is for you. Or, if you’ve put together a well-stocked home gym, this is where you should start as well. While it may not be the fitness paradise you crave, it almost certainly has all the tools you need to build a great body. The workouts that follow will show you how to take advantage of them.\\n\\nWe’re assuming your gym has barbells, dumbbells, a powerrack, adjustable benches, cables, Swiss balls, and pullup bars. With that much inventory, you can easily complete the various options of workouts we outline for you. These include three distinct routines for gaining muscle, two for losing fat, and two for body recomposition —workouts that hit the magical combination of both muscle gain and fat loss to reshape your physique with minimal change in body weight.\\n\\nTHE BEST BODY- RECOMPOSITION WORKOUT [option A] WORKOUT #1 BY JOE DOWDELL, C.S.C.S.\\n\\nWe can’t ov erstate the aw esomeness of G erman engineering. The\\n\\nland that brought us jet planes, the M ercedes, and H eidi Klum also\\n\\nintroduced perhaps the best method of body recomposition know n to the\\n\\nfitness industry —that is, a timeless strategy to gain muscle and lose body fat\\n\\nsimultaneously . A chtung!\\n\\nHOW IT WORKS\\n\\nH ala Rambie, a scientist w ho defected to West G ermany during the C old War,\\n\\nfound that fat loss could be accelerated by raising lev els of blood lactate—an\\n\\nenergy substrate. M ore lactate corresponds to greater release of grow th\\n\\nhormone, w hich tells y our body to grow muscle and burn flab.\\n\\nThe best way to raise lactate quickly is to pair upper- and lower-body exercises, or opposing movements, for reps in the 8–15 range. The sweet spot for sets is three, and rest periods are restricted to 30–60 seconds. This approach has since become known as German Body Comp.\\n\\nDIRECTIONS\\n\\nA lternate sets of “A ” and “B” exercises. S o y ou’ll do a set of A , rest, then a\\n\\nset of B, rest again, and so on for all the prescribed sets. The remaining\\n\\nexercises are done as straight sets.\\n\\nTo increase the intensity, decrease your rest between sets by 15 seconds every two weeks. Start by resting 60 seconds for the first two weeks. Then in Weeks 3 and 4, rest 45 seconds, and so on.\\n\\nTEMPO\\n\\nE ach exercise is assigned a tempo.\\n\\n(A “0” indicates no time—simply mov e on to the next digit.) F or example, a\\n\\nfront squat w ith a tempo of 3110 w ould be done like so: Take three seconds\\n\\nto low er y ourself into the squat. P ause for one second at the bottom. Take\\n\\none second to come back up to standing, and then go right back into the\\n\\ndescent.\\n\\n1A DEADLIFT\\n\\nSETS: 3 REPS: 8–10 TEMPO: 4010 REST: 60 SEC.\\n\\nStand with your feet hip width. Bend your hips back to reach down and grasp the bar, hands just outside your knees. Keeping your lower back in its natural arch, drive your heels into the floor and pull the bar up along your shins until you’re standing with hips fully extended and the bar is in front of your thighs.\\n\\n1B 1¼ NEUTRAL-GRIP DUMBBELL BENCH PRESS\\n\\nSETS: 3 REPS: 8–10 TEMPO: 3020 REST: 60 SEC.\\n\\nLie back on a flat bench with a dumbbell in each hand. Turn your wrists so your palms face each other. Press the weights over your chest and then lower back down. Come back up one quarter of the way, and then down again. Now press up to lockout once more. That’s one rep. Take three seconds to lower the weights down from the lockout position, and two seconds when pressing to lockout.\\n\\n2A BULGARIAN SPLIT SQUAT\\n\\nSETS: 3 REPS: 8–10 (EA CH SIDE) TEMPO: 3110 REST: 60 SEC.\\n\\nStand lunge-length in front of a bench. Hold a dumbbell in each hand and rest the top of your left foot on the bench behind you. Lower your body until your rear knee nearly touches the floor and your front thigh is parallel to the floor.\\n\\n2B INVERTED ROW\\n\\nSETS: 3 REPS: 10–12 TEMPO: 2011 REST: 60 SEC.\\n\\nSet a barbell in a power rack (or use a Smith machine) at about hip height. Lie underneath it and grasp it with hands about shoulder-width apart. Hang from the bar so your body forms a straight line. Squeeze your shoulder blades together and pull yourself up until your back is fully contracted.\\n\\n3A DIP\\n\\nSETS: 3 REPS: 10–12 TEMPO: 3110 REST: 60 SEC.\\n\\nSuspend yourself over the bars of a dip station and lower your body until your upper arms are parallel to the floor.\\n\\n3B SEATED INCLINE DUMBBELL CURL\\n\\nSETS: 3 REPS: 10–12 TEMPO: 4010 REST: 60 SEC.\\n\\nSet an adjustable bench between 45 and 60 degrees and sit back against it with a dumbbell in each hand. Curl the weights to shoulder height without allowing your elbows to drift in front of your shoulders.\\n\\n4 SWISS BALL ROLLOUT\\n\\nSETS: 3 REPS: 10–15 TEMPO: 2020 REST: 60 SEC.\\n\\nKneel on the floor and rest your forearms on a Swiss ball. Keeping your core braced, roll the ball forward so your arms are extended. Stop before your lower back begins to sag. Roll yourself back.\\n\\nTHE BEST BODY- RECOMPOSITION WORKOUT [option B] WORKOUT #2 BY JOE DOWDELL, C.S.C.S.\\n\\nU se this routine just as y ou did the prev ious one—Body -\\n\\nRecomposition O ption A .

Hang from the bar and then pull yourself up until your chin is over it.\\n\\n04 BARBELL\\n\\nBecause of its association with bench pressing, squatting, and deadlifting, the barbell tends to be thought of as a tool that’s good only for performing specific lifts or hitting one muscle group at a time. In later chapters we’ll show you how to get great workouts for any body part with a barbell alone, but here we’ve got routines that work your whole body.\\n\\nYou don’t necessarily need a bench, a rack, or even two matched plates to get a good workout with a barbell. A corner of a room in which you can wedge one end can be enough. And if you use the Olympic lifts—the exercises contested in Olympic weightlifting competitions—you can hit every major muscle of the body in minutes. These are just two of the approaches you’re about to discover.\\n\\nTHE BEST BARBELL-ONLY WORKOUT [option A] WORKOUT #8 BY JOE STANKOWSKI, C.P.T.\\n\\nIf y ou train at home or any w here else that prov ides only a barbell\\n\\nand a small amount of w eight, y ou can make the most of it by\\n\\nspeeding or slow ing y our reps and performing y our exercises circuit-sty le.\\n\\nHOW IT WORKS\\n\\nThe barbell w as inv ented to carry balanced loads but w orks just as w ell out\\n\\nof balance. The follow ing exercises can be performed w ith one end w edged\\n\\nbetw een tw o w alls w hile y ou lift the other end like a lev er. You may find\\n\\nthat pressing the bar like a lev er feels less stressful to y our shoulders, plus it\\n\\nactiv ates y our core to a greater degree.\\n\\nDIRECTIONS\\n\\nP erform the exercises as a circuit, completing one set of each in turn w ithout\\n\\nrest. If an exercise feels easy using the load y ou hav e av ailable, perform\\n\\ny our reps slow er and w ith more control. (O r, if y ou hav e extra w eight, load\\n\\nit.) A nother option is to choke dow n on the bar. G ripping it low er w ill decrease\\n\\ny our mechanical adv antage and make the exercise harder.\\n\\nAfter the last exercise, rest two minutes and then repeat the entire circuit. Continue for 20 minutes. You\\n\\ncan repeat the workout up to four times per week, resting a day between sessions.\\n\\n1 SPLIT SQUAT TO PRESS\\n\\nREPS: 10–12 (EA CH SIDE) REST: 0 SEC.\\n\\nWedge the end of the barbell into a corner of the room (to avoid damage to the walls, you may have to wrap a towel around it). Load the opposite end with a weight plate and grasp it toward the end. Get into a lunge position with your left leg in front, bent to where your thigh is parallel to the floor and your right knee nearly touches the floor. Stand up explosively and press the bar straight up.\\n\\n2 SINGLE-ARM ROW W/ PARTIAL LUNGE\\n\\nREPS: 10–12 (EA CH SIDE) REST: 0 SEC.\\n\\nHold the barbell behind the sleeve (where you load the weights) with your left hand. Get into a lunge position but not deep—keep both legs slightly extended so that the bar and plate don’t brush the floor. Draw your shoulder blade back and row the bar to your ribs.\\n\\n3 BARBELL RUSSIAN TWIST\\n\\nREPS: 10–12 (EA CH SIDE) REST: 0 SEC.\\n\\nGrasp the bar near the very end again—this time with both hands. Stand with feet shoulder width. Swing the bar to your left, pivoting your feet as needed, and then swing to your right.\\n\\n4 LEVER FLOOR PRESS\\n\\nREPS: 10–12 (EA CH SIDE) REST: 120 SEC.\\n\\nLie on your back on the floor and grasp the end of the bar again behind the sleeve with your left hand. Hold it just above your shoulder and extend your right arm out to your side for support. Press the bar over your chest.\\n\\nTHE BEST BARBELL-ONLY WORKOUT [option B] WORKOUT #9 BY BRIAN GRASSO\\n\\nC all this one the “N o E xcuses Workout” because w e hav e y et to hear\\n\\na compelling reason w hy someone can’t succeed w ith it. F irst of all, it\\n\\ntakes only six minutes to complete. S econd, it requires just a barbell and a\\n\\npair of plates. Load the bar once and y ou’re ready to go. Think y ou can\\n\\nhandle that?\\n\\nHOW IT WORKS\\n\\nThe w orkout is a barbell complex—a series of exercises that flow . The finish\\n\\nposition of the hang clean sets y ou up perfectly for the front squat, w hich then\\n\\nallow s y ou to mov e right into the ov erhead press, and so on.\\n\\nChoose one weight, which will be determined by the exercise you can lift the least amount on (in this case, the overhead lunge), and go for it. The pace will be so intense that you’ll be grateful the workout is over in six minutes. Fortunately, your metabolism will remain accelerated for 48 hours afterward.\\n\\nDIRECTIONS\\n\\nP erform the exercises as a circuit, completing one set of each in turn w ithout\\n\\nrest. C omplete three reps for each mov e. Time y our circuit. A fter the last\\n\\nexercise, check y our timer and rest as long as it took y ou to perform the\\n\\ncircuit. Repeat for three total circuits.\\n\\nChoose a load you could use for 10 reps on a normal overhead press, and keep that same weight for all the exercises.\\n\\n1 ROMANIAN DEADLIFT\\n\\nREPS: 3 REST: 0 SEC.\\n\\nHold the bar at shoulder width and stand with feet hip width. Bend your hips back as far as you can. Allow your knees to bend as needed while you lower the bar along your shins until you feel a stretch in your hamstrings. Keep your lower back arched throughout. Squeeze your glutes as you come back up.\\n\\n2 HANG CLEAN\\n\\nREPS: 3 REST: 0 SEC.\\n\\nWith the bar in front of your thighs, bend your hips and knees so that the bar lowers to just above your knees. Now explosively extend your hips as if jumping while at the same time shrugging your shoulders and pulling the bar straight up in front of your torso. As the bar reaches chest level, bend your elbows so that your palms face the ceiling and catch the bar at shoulder level. Bend your hips and knees as you catch the bar to absorb the impact.\\n\\n3 FRONT SQUAT\\n\\nREPS: 3 REST: 0 SEC.\\n\\nFrom the catch position of the hang clean, squat as low as you can without losing the arch in your lower back.\\n\\n4 OVERHEAD PRESS\\n\\nREPS: 3 REST: 0 SEC.\\n\\nFrom standing, press the bar overhead, pushing your head forward and shrugging your traps as the bar passes your face.\\n\\n5 OVERHEAD LUNGE\\n\\nREPS: 3 (EA CH SIDE) REST: SEE DIRECTIONS\\n\\nHold the bar overhead and step forward with your left leg. Lower yourself until your left thigh is parallel to the floor and your rear knee nearly touches the floor.\\n\\n05 DUMBBELLS & KETTLEBELLS\\n\\nEver since the reemergence of the kettlebell as a training staple about a decade ago, there’s been a debate over which is superior, dumbbells or kettlebells. While this argument is pretty much a stalemate, we’ll take kettlebells.\\n\\nFor one, kettlebells have thicker handles, so your grip and forearms are recruited more heavily. For another, the bell hangs at a distance from the handle, so the load is offset, which makes every move more difficult to stabilize and more demanding of your core to provide that stability. Furthermore, just about any exercise you can think to do with a dumbbell can be replicated with a kettlebell and will feel much harder.\\n\\nBut, hey, people have been getting ripped sans kettlebells for years, so if dumbbells are all you have, forget what you read above. Dumbbells tend to take up less space and are a little more convenient to store, and they’re certainly more common and easy to find, so you might as well learn how to make the most of them. This chapter explores your options when training\\n\\nconditions are most dire—when you have access only to embarrassingly light weights, mismatched weights, or even just one weight. All the workouts that follow can be performed with either dumbbells or kettlebells. Or, a single bell, as the case may be.\\n\\nTHE BEST TWO- DUMBBELL/KETTLEBELL WORKOUT [option A] WORKOUT #10 BY JOE STANKOWSKI, C.P.T.\\n\\nWhether y ou’re v isiting relativ es or in a hotel w ith an underw helming\\n\\n“fitness center,” there may come a time w hen all y ou hav e access to\\n\\nis a measly pair of dumbbells or kettlebells. N ot a problem, now that y ou\\n\\nhav e this routine.\\n\\nHOW IT WORKS\\n\\nIn this situation, the load y ou hav e w ill be more appropriate for some\\n\\nexercises than others. To see that y ou get the most out of the w orkout w e\\n\\nprescribe here, w hatev er the poundage y ou hav e to w ork w ith, y ou’ll need to\\n\\nadjust the speed of y our reps. A pair of 25-pound dumbbells, for example,\\n\\nprobably w on’t be challenging on exercises such as the stepup. In this case,\\n\\nperform y our reps more slow ly to test y our endurance and build muscle\\n\\ncontrol. O n other exercises, like the bentov er lateral raise, 25 pounds may be\\n\\njust right or a bit heav y , so perform y our reps explosiv ely .\\n\\nIf you should happen to have two unevenly weighted dumbbells, such as a 25-pounder and a 15-pounder, don’t be discouraged. Simply switch the weights in your hands each time you repeat the circuit. Asymmetrical loads force\\n\\nyour core to stabilize you even more on each exercise.\\n\\nDIRECTIONS\\n\\nP erform the exercises as a circuit, completing one set of each in turn w ithout\\n\\nrest. A fter the last exercise, rest tw o minutes and then repeat. C ontinue for 20\\n\\nminutes. You can repeat the w orkout up to four times per w eek.\\n\\n1 SIDE PLANK W/ LATERAL RAISE\\n\\nSETS: A S MA NY A S POSSIBLE REPS: 10–12 (EA CH SIDE) REST: 0 SEC.\\n\\nLie on your left side resting your left forearm on the floor for support. Hold the dumbbell in your right hand. Raise your hips up so that your body forms a straight line and brace your abs—your weight should be on your left forearm and the edge of your left foot. From this position, raise the weight in your right hand until your arm is parallel to the floor. If the dumbbell or kettlebell you have is too heavy to perform a lateral raise with in this position, you can use a weight plate from the dumbbell (if it’s the plate-loaded kind), or simply skip the lateral raise and use the weight to resist your side plank.\\n\\n2 SINGLE-LEG ROMANIAN DEADLIFT\\n\\nSETS: A S MA NY A S POSSIBLE REPS: 10–12 (EA CH SIDE) REST: 0 SEC.\\n\\nHold a dumbbell in one hand and stand on the opposite leg.

If y ou hav e only one pair of dumbbells, ignore the rep\\n\\nranges on ev ery thing but the Bulgarian split squat and stepup, and go for as\\n\\nmany reps as possible each set.\\n\\nDIRECTIONS\\n\\nP erform exercises 1A through 1C as a circuit. S o, y ou’ll do one set of the\\n\\nBulgarian split squat, one set of stepups, and then one set of the dumbbell\\n\\nsquat before resting for tw o minutes. Repeat until all the prescribed sets are\\n\\ncomplete. P erform the remaining paired exercises (2A and 2B, 3A and 3B) as\\n\\nsupersets. That means y ou’ll do a set of A and then a set of B before resting,\\n\\nand repeat until all sets are completed for the pair.

MURPHY, M.F.S.\\n\\nA s trendy as kettlebells hav e become, many chain gy ms don’t offer\\n\\nenough that y ou can be sure y ou’ll get a matching pair at a giv en time\\n\\n(especially if that time is during peak hours). Your best bet then is to do w hat\\n\\ny ou can w ith a single kettlebell.\\n\\nIncidentally, if you train at home and have just one\\n\\ndumbbell that you’ve been using as a paperweight up until now, this workout applies equally to you (kettlebells and dumbbells can be used interchangeably).\\n\\nHOW IT WORKS\\n\\nO ne bell offers a distinct set of benefits from a pair. Your body w ill hav e to\\n\\ncompensate for the imbalance by recruiting y our core muscles more intensely ,\\n\\nand w orking one side at a time w ill make for longer sets w ith a greater\\n\\ncardiov ascular demand. Done as a circuit, the exercises that follow raise y our\\n\\nheart rate ev en further, making this w orkout a great adjunct to a strict diet for\\n\\nfat loss.\\n\\nDIRECTIONS\\n\\nThe w orkout consists of tw o circuits. In C ircuit 1, y ou’ll perform the exercises\\n\\nin sequence for six reps each. C omplete as many rounds as possible in six\\n\\nminutes, and then rest one minute. Repeat tw ice more and then rest tw o\\n\\nminutes before beginning C ircuit 2.\\n\\nCIRCUIT 1\\n\\n1 ONE-ARM SNATCH\\n\\nREPS: 6 (EA CH SIDE) REST: 0 SEC.\\n\\nHold a kettlebell in front of your thighs with your right hand and stand with feet between hip and shoulder width. Keep your torso as upright as possible and bend your knees until the weight hangs at mid-shin level— maintain the arch in your lower back. Jump, extending your hips explosively, and raise the weight straight up your body. When it gets to your chest, flip your wrist and “catch” the bell overhead with arm extended.\\n\\n2 KETTLEBELL PRESS-OUT\\n\\nREPS: 6 REST: 0 SEC.\\n\\nHold the weight close to your chest at shoulder level with both hands on the handle and palms facing each other. Squat down as deeply as you can and then press the bell straight out in front of you with arms extended. Bring it back to your chest and repeat for reps while maintaining the squat position.\\n\\n3 HARD-STYLE KETTLEBELL SWING\\n\\nREPS: 6 REST: 0 SEC.\\n\\nStand with feet hip-width apart and the weight on the floor. Grasp the kettlebell with both hands (palms facing you) and, keeping your lower back flat, extend your hips to raise it off the floor. From there, take a deep breath and bend your hips back, allowing the weight to swing back between your legs. Explosively extend your hips and exhale—allowing the momentum to swing the weight up to shoulder level. Control the descent, but use the momentum to begin the next rep.\\n\\nCIRCUIT 2\\n\\nTURKISH GETUP\\n\\nLie on your back on the floor holding a kettlebell with your right hand over your chest, arm perpendicular to the floor. Bend your right knee 90 degrees and plant your foot on the floor. Brace your abs and raise your torso off the floor. Use your left hand for support. Now use your right foot to raise your hips off the floor. Sweep your left leg back and rest on your left knee. Come up to a standing position, and then reverse the motion to return to the floor. Note that the foot that rests on the floor changes with the hand that’s holding the weight (when you perform the getup with the left hand, your left foot will lie flat). Perform one rep with the weight in your right hand and then immediately switch hands and repeat. Switch back to your right hand and do two reps. Then do two on your left. Continue adding one extra rep in this fashion until you’re up to five on each side. Without rest, reverse the process and work back down to one rep.\\n\\n06 MACHINES\\n\\nWe’ve never been big fans of machines at Men’s Fitness. For most people, they represent taking the path of least resistance—literally. Machines determine your range of motion and the way your muscles move the weight, so you don’t train your body to do these things. If you’re just getting into lifting and want to gain weight and get stronger, machines aren’t the best way to go. But if you’re older and have nagging injuries, or you want to isolate one muscle at a time to bring it up, machines may be your best weapons.\\n\\nOf course, you may find yourself in a situation where it’s\\n\\nmachines or bust, as in the case of some hotel gyms and community fitness centers. In any event, you can get just as hard a workout with machinery as you can with iron. A note here: Whenever possible, we’d prefer you do your machine exercises on Hammer Strength equipment (lifefitness.com). This is a quality brand that offers a unique feature—isolateral movement. That means you can lift each limb independently. In this way, Hammer Strength equipment follows your unique biomechanics, letting your limbs work in their natural fashion, rather than having to conform to the narrower paths that most machines set.\\n\\nTHE BEST ALL-MACHINE WORKOUT WORKOUT #13 BY JASON FERRUGGIA\\n\\nThere are three likely reasons y ou w ould do a w orkout entirely w ith\\n\\nmachines. O ne is that y ou fear free w eights. A nother is that y ou’re in\\n\\na hotel gy m w ith machines as y our only w orkout options, and the third is that\\n\\ny ou’re a little beat up and need to protect ov erw orked joints or w ork around\\n\\nnagging injuries. Whatev er the case may be, machines are suitable muscle-\\n\\nbuilding equipment, and y ou can train y our w hole body w ith them.\\n\\nHOW IT WORKS\\n\\nThis w orkout uses a classic body building approach: py ramid sets. You start\\n\\nw ith higher reps and increase the w eight slightly each set w hile reducing reps\\n\\nto gradually w arm up the muscles and joints and recruit more and more\\n\\nmuscle fibers. N o matter how hard y ou train or how heav y y ou go, y ou’re\\n\\nunlikely to get injured, because the machines are stabilizing the load for y ou.\\n\\nThis isn’t alw ay s ideal, but it does allow y ou to push y ourself and focus y our\\n\\nmind solely on the muscles y ou w ant to w ork w ithout w orry ing about a freak\\n\\naccident keeping y ou out of the gy m for w eeks.\\n\\nDIRECTIONS\\n\\nP erform the exercise pairs (marked “A ” and “B”) as alternating sets. S o y ou’ll\\n\\ndo a set of A , rest, then a set of B, rest again, and continue for all the\\n\\nprescribed sets. The remaining exercises are done as conv entional straight\\n\\nsets.\\n\\n1A CHEST PRESS\\n\\nSETS: 3 REPS: 12, 10, 8 REST: 60 SEC.\\n\\nAdjust the height of the seat so that the handles are in line with the middle of your chest. When you grasp the handles, your elbows should be bent nearly 90 degrees. Press the handles until your elbows are locked out. Keep tension on your muscles at the bottom of each rep.\\n\\n1B CHEST-SUPPORTED ROW\\n\\nSETS: 3 REPS: 12, 10, 8 REST: 60 SEC.\\n\\nUsing a chest-supported row machine, row the weight to your belly, squeezing your shoulder blades together at the top of the movement.\\n\\n2A SHOULDER PRESS\\n\\nSETS: 3 REPS: 12, 10, 8 REST: 60 SEC.\\n\\nAdjust the seat of a shoulder press machine so that the handles are at shoulder level. If you have shoulder problems, and if your machine allows it, grasp the handles so your palms face each other. Otherwise, grasp them with palms facing forward as normal. Make sure your elbows track in a normal pressing path as you press the handles overhead.\\n\\n2B NEUTRAL-GRIP PULLDOWN\\n\\nSETS: 3 REPS: 15, 12, 10 REST: 60 SEC.\\n\\nAttach a close-grip V-handle to the pulley of a lat- pulldown machine, or use two single-grip handles as shown. Grasp the handle so your palms face each other and set your legs under the pad. Pull the handle to your collarbone, driving your elbows down and back.\\n\\n3 CALF RAISE ON LEG PRESS\\n\\nSETS: 3 REPS: 25, 20, 15 REST: 60 SEC.\\n\\nSet up in a leg press machine and place your feet at the bottom of the foot plate at shoulder width so that only the balls of your feet are on the plate. Remove the safeties and allow the weight to flex your ankles slowly until you feel a stretch in your calves. Extend your ankles to raise the weight back up.\\n\\n4 LEG PRESS\\n\\nSETS: 4 REPS: 25, 20, 15, 10 REST: 120 SEC.\\n\\nAdjust the seat of the machine so that you can sit comfortably with your hips beneath your knees and your knees in line with your feet. Remove the safeties and lower your knees toward your chest until they’re bent 90 degrees and then press back up. Be careful not to go too low or you risk your lower back coming off the seat (which can cause injury).\\n\\n07 BANDS\\n\\nThe elastic exercise band tends to get lumped in with the Body Bar, aerobics step, and Shake Weight as so-called “wussy” equipment, while the barbell and dumbbell are beyond reproach. But this isn’t a fair judgment, especially if you’re using high-quality bands.\\n\\nWe like the loop bands that Elitefts.net sells. They’re\\n\\ndurable and can be used for multiple purposes andnumerous exercises. If a cheap one is all you have, you can make do, but Elite’s bands are a good investment, especiallyif you plan on traveling a lot. Lightweight and compact, they allow you to take your workouts with you. What bands provide that no other equipment (except\\n\\ncables) can is accommodating resistance. Take the pushup, for example. The closer you get to locking out your elbows, the easier the exercise feels. The movement feels hardest when your chest is close to the floor. Adding resistance to the pushup with a band will intensify the last few inches of the move—as the band gets more stretched out—making you work harder, and there’s nothing wussy about that.\\n\\nTHE BEST FULL-BODY BAND WORKOUT WORKOUT #14 BY BEN BRUNO\\n\\nThis w orkout gets y our blood mov ing. In fact, it makes it run up and\\n\\ndow n y our body as y ou alternate betw een upper- and low er-body\\n\\nexercises, forcing y our heart to w ork extra hard, w hich in turn, stimulates\\n\\ncalorie burning. The result is increased strength and conditioning w hile\\n\\ntrimming fat.\\n\\nHOW IT WORKS\\n\\nThe exercises are grouped into “non-competing” mini-circuits. This means that\\n\\nthey w ork different areas of the body so muscle fatigue isn’t carried ov er from\\n\\none mov e to the next. F or instance, follow ing up a pushup w ith a good\\n\\nmorning w on’t make y our chest any more tired, so y ou can giv e each\\n\\nexercise y our full effort and strength. Your heart, how ev er, experiences the\\n\\nopposite effect. With blood racing back and forth to different muscles, y our\\n\\nheart rate is constantly elev ated. This leads to more calories burned during the\\n\\nw orkout and greater fat loss afterw ard.\\n\\nDIRECTIONS\\n\\nP erform the exercise groups in sequence.

N ote that the last group is just tw o\\n\\nexercises, though done in the same fashion. M ake sure y ou hav e a few\\n\\ndifferent band options so y ou can use the appropriate tension on each\\n\\nexercise.\\n\\n1A PUSHUP\\n\\nSETS: 4 REPS: 10–12 REST: 60 SEC.\\n\\nGrasp the end of a band in one hand and wrap it around your back. Get into pushup position with your hands shoulder width and your core braced. Pin both hands to the floor with the ends of the band in your palms and perform pushups.\\n\\n1B GOOD MORNING\\n\\nSETS: 4 REPS: 12 REST: 60 SEC.\\n\\nStand on the band and loop the other end over the back of your neck and stand tall. Keeping your lower back in its natural arch, bend your hips back and lower your torso until it’s nearly parallel to the floor. Think about keeping your chest up and pointing forward. Explosively extend your hips to come back up.\\n\\n1C PULL APART\\n\\nSETS: 4 REPS: 10 REST: 60 SEC.\\n\\nStand on and grasp a band loop, or a single tube as shown, hands shoulder width. Keeping your arms straight, raise your arms in front of your body to shoulder level. Now, without letting your arms drop, draw your arms out 90 degrees to your sides as if you were pulling the tube apart. Squeeze your shoulder blades together.\\n\\n2A SQUAT\\n\\nSETS: 4 REPS: 20 REST: 60 SEC.\\n\\nStand on the band or tube with feet shoulder width and toes turned slightly out. Grasp the ends of the band in each hand and hold them at shoulder level with palms facing you. Bend your hips back and squat down as low as you can without losing the arch in your lower back. Explosively extend your hips to come back up.\\n\\n2B BAND ROW\\n\\nSETS: 4 REPS: 15 REST: 60 SEC.\\n\\nAttach the band to a doorknob or other sturdy object of similar height. Hold the opposite end in both hands and stand back from the door so you feel tension on the band. Row the band to your belly.\\n\\n2C PALLOF PRESS\\n\\nSETS: 4 REPS: 10 (EA CH SIDE) REST: 60 SEC.\\n\\nAttach the band to a sturdy object at stomach level. Hold the other end with both hands and step away from the attachment point, turning your body perpendicular to it to put tension on the band. Pull the band in front of your chest and then press it out with arms straight. Bend your arms and draw your hands back toward you, resisting the band from twisting your torso. That’s one rep.\\n\\n3A TRICEPS PUSHDOWN\\n\\nSETS: 4 REPS: 20 REST: 60 SEC.\\n\\nAttach the band to a sturdy overhead object and grasp the free end with both hands.

The most popular brand, of course, is the TRX (trx.com), but competitors like the Jungle Gym XT (lifelineusa.com)—which we use to show the exercises that follow—are fine, too, so long as they offer foot cradles for performing lower-body exercises. With a suspension trainer’s incredible versatility, the number of exercises you can perform with it is about aslimitless as your imagination. It allows you to train the whole body using exercises that would be nearly impossible with free weights, machines, or any other equipment. And unlike those other tools, the suspension trainer can travel anywhere you do, and takes up about as much space in your suitcase as a pair of pants.\\n\\nWe suggest you don’t leave home without either one.\\n\\nTHE BEST SUSPENSION- TRAINER WORKOUT WORKOUT #15 BY JAY CARDIELLO\\n\\nA suspension trainer, such as the TRX or Jungle G y m XT, can mean\\n\\nthe difference betw een sticking w ith y our training w hile on the road\\n\\nand returning from y our trav els feeling slobbish. S o long as y our suspension\\n\\ntrainer is fully adjustable and offers foot cradles y ou’ll hav e a total-body gy m\\n\\nthat y ou can unpack from y our suitcase w henev er, w herev er.\\n\\nHOW IT WORKS\\n\\nThe kind of instability a suspension trainer prov ides is ideal for core\\n\\nstrengthening. To increase the instability , w e’v e designed this w orkout using\\n\\nunilateral exercises, meaning that y ou’ll be training each side of y our body\\n\\nindiv idually . If y ou need to reduce the intensity of an exercise, simply\\n\\nincrease the angle of y our body to the floor (shorten the length of the\\n\\nhandles/straps).\\n\\nThe workout at right lets you customize your training,\\n\\ngiving you a specific period of time in which to do your reps, rather than a concrete number of reps to hit every set.\\n\\nDIRECTIONS\\n\\nP erform the exercises as a circuit, completing one set of each in sequence. Do\\n\\nas many reps as y ou can in 30 seconds, resting only as long as it takes to set\\n\\nup the next exercise. P erform tw o to four circuits.\\n\\n1 SINGLE-LEG ROW\\n\\nREPS: A S MA NY A S POSSIBLE IN 30 SEC. (EA CH SIDE) REST: 0 SEC.\\n\\nAttach a suspension trainer to a doorframe or other sturdy object and stand on your left leg. Hold the handles and get into a lunge position with your rear knee bent— but keep your foot raised above the floor. Row your body to the handles while driving your right knee up in front of you.\\n\\n2 SINGLE-LEG WOBBLE LUNGE\\n\\nREPS: A S MA NY A S POSSIBLE IN 30 SEC. (EA CH SIDE) REST: 0 SEC.\\n\\nSet the foot cradle of the suspension trainer to about a foot and a half above the floor and turn around. Raise your right foot and rest it inside the cradle. Bend your left knee so you descend into a lunge position.\\n\\n3 UNI-BRIDGE PRESS\\n\\nREPS: A S MA NY A S POSSIBLE IN 30 SEC. (EA CH SIDE) REST: 0 SEC.\\n\\nFace the suspension trainer’s attachment point and hold one handle in your left hand. Pick up a water bottle (or some other source of light resistance) in your right hand as if you were going to press. Lean back so your body is in a straight line at an angle, suspended by the handle. Row your body up until the handle touches your ribs while pressing the right hand over your chest.\\n\\n4 TAP OUT\\n\\nREPS: A S MA NY A S POSSIBLE IN 30 SEC. (EA CH SIDE) REST: 0 SEC.\\n\\nSet your feet in the cradles of the trainer and get into pushup position.

While medicine ball construction has come a long way since then, the science of how to use one hasn’t really had to evolve.\\n\\nMed balls can be thrown, caught, rested on, or lifted\\n\\nlike other weights, to apply a variety of stimuli to the muscles. Whether you want to experiment with one as a fun way to change up your workouts, or you find yourself someplace where the med ball (or a similar-sized volleyball or soccer ball) is the only implement you have to work with, we can show you how to use it like the sophisticated tool that it is.\\n\\nTHE BEST MEDICINE- BALL WORKOUT WORKOUT #16 BY ZACH EVEN-ESH\\n\\nThe medicine ball has been around forev er, but most guy s don’t know\\n\\nw hat to do w ith it, besides holding it against their chests during situps.\\n\\nE v en a light ball can deliv er an intense w orkout that burns fat and builds\\n\\nathletic pow er.\\n\\nHOW IT WORKS\\n\\nThe med ball can be used to replicate v arious O ly mpic w eightlifting exercises,\\n\\nand it makes performing them much simpler. These burn calories and build\\n\\nspeed, w hich is helpful if y ou’re interested in being competitiv e in backy ard\\n\\npickup games. In fact, the med ball is probably the most useful tool for\\n\\ndev eloping explosiv e strength because it’s meant to be throw n as hard as\\n\\npossible. When y ou toss it, y ou teach y our body to accelerate w ithout braking\\n\\nitself for safety .\\n\\nImagine a bench press done explosively—your shoulders\\n\\nmust slow it down at the end of the range of motion or they risk getting torn out of their sockets by the speed. The ball allows your body to “let go” safely because, well, you actually let go.\\n\\nA med ball can also be used to create an unstable\\n\\nsurface, such as by doing pushups on it. The dome shape\\n\\nforces you to stabilize your body more or risk taking a spill, and that means more activation of the abs.\\n\\nDIRECTIONS\\n\\nP erform the exercise pairs (marked “A ” and “B”) as supersets, so y ou’ll\\n\\ncomplete one set of A and then B before resting. Repeat until all sets are\\n\\ncomplete and then go on to the next superset.\\n\\n1A CLEAN AND PRESS\\n\\nSETS: 3 REPS: 10 REST: 0 SEC.\\n\\nHold the ball and stand with feet shoulder width. Bend your hips and knees and lower your body with arms extended until the ball is just above knee level. Explosively extend your hips and knees as if jumping, shrug your shoulders, and raise the ball to shoulder level. Squat down as you “catch” the momentum of the ball. Stand up and press it overhead. That’s one rep.\\n\\n1B SITUP AND THROW\\n\\nSETS: 3 REPS: 10 REST: 60 SEC.\\n\\nHold the ball with both hands in front of your chest and sit on the floor. Anchor your feet under something sturdy for support, and lie back on the floor a few feet away from a brick or concrete wall. Explosively sit up and throw the ball into the wall and then catch it on the rebound. If you have a partner, you can throw the ball to him instead and let him throw it back.\\n\\n2A MOUNTAIN CLIMBER\\n\\nSETS: 2 REPS: 20 (EA CH LEG) REST: 0 SEC.\\n\\nHold the ball with both hands and get into pushup position on the floor.

Bend your left knee and rest the top of your left foot on the bench behind you. Lower your body until your front thigh is parallel to the floor.\\n\\n3B SEATED KNEE TUCK\\n\\nSETS: 2 REPS: 10 REST: 60 SEC.\\n\\nSit on a bench and squeeze the ball between your feet. Extend and elevate your legs out in front of you and extend your torso so that your body forms a straight line. Hold on to the bench for support. Crunch your torso forward and bring your knees to your chest.\\n\\n10 SWISS BALL\\n\\nSwiss balls were created as a tool for rehab, but their value in working the core and a host of stabilizer muscles is now universally known. If you’re a man of average height (about 5′9″), a ball with a 65-centimeter diameter will work best for you. Always make sure the ball is fully inflated and, for heaven’s sake, don’t try to stand on it. Wacky parlor tricks have given the Swiss ball a bad name, but used properly, it can improve your balance and strength rather than deprive you of them.\\n\\nTHE BEST SWISS-BALL WORKOUT WORKOUT #17 BY JIM SMITH, C.S.C.S.\\n\\nIt may be hard to imagine w orking y our entire body w ith just a S w iss\\n\\nball. A fter all, y ou can’t curl it, press it, or squat it. But the ball can let\\n\\ny ou get into positions to w ork y our muscles that y ou w ouldn’t normally think\\n\\nof, and the stability those positions require w orks more muscle than y ou\\n\\nrealize.\\n\\nHOW IT WORKS\\n\\nM any of the exercises flow into each other or consist of combinations of\\n\\nmov ements that flow together to equal one rep. C ontrolling these mov ements\\n\\non an unstable ball makes ev ery mov e a core exercise, ev en w hile y ou’re\\n\\ntargeting the chest, shoulders, legs, and back.\\n\\nDIRECTIONS\\n\\nP erform the exercises as a circuit, completing one set of each in turn w ithout\\n\\nrest. A fter the last exercise, rest tw o to three minutes and then repeat the\\n\\nentire circuit for three total sets.\\n\\n1 PUSHUP W/ FEET ON BALL\\n\\nSETS: 3 REPS: 20 REST: 0 SEC.\\n\\nGet into pushup position on the floor with hands shoulder width and rest your feet on the ball.

Do not let your hips dip or sway side to side at any point.\\n\\n2 T ON BALL\\n\\nSETS: 3 REPS: 20 REST: 0 SEC.\\n\\nLie chest-down on the ball and raise your arms out in front of you with palms facing up. Now move them out 90 degrees to form a T shape. Hold for one or two seconds with your shoulder blades squeezed together.\\n\\n3 BODY-WEIGHT SQUAT\\n\\nSETS: 3 REPS: 20 REST: 0 SEC.\\n\\nStand with feet shoulder width and toes turned out slightly. Sit back with your hips and lower your body as far as you can without rounding your lower back. Push your knees out as you descend and keep your chest up.\\n\\n4 LEG CURL\\n\\nSETS: 3 REPS: 20 REST: 0 SEC.\\n\\nLie on your back on the floor and rest your heels on a Swiss ball. Brace your abs and drive your heels into the ball to raise your hips off the floor. Bend your knees and roll the ball toward you. Keep your hips elevated the entire set.\\n\\n5 PIKE-UP TO SUPERMAN\\n\\nSETS: 3 REPS: 20 REST: 120–180 SEC.\\n\\nGet into pushup position with your toes on the ball. Bend your hips and roll the ball toward you so your torso becomes vertical. Roll back so your body is straight again and extend your spine, then roll the ball up your legs so your body forms a straight line with arms extended overhead but hands still on the floor. You should look like Superman flying downward. That’s one rep. Pull with your lats to return to the pushup position and begin the next rep.\\n\\n11 BODY WEIGHT\\n\\nThe most obvious advantage of body-weight workouts is that you can do them without equipment and in almost any location. But if that means absolutely no equipment— as in, not even a pullup bar—you’ll need to get pretty creative to be able to work your back.\\n\\nWe got that creative. When it’s warm, you may want to take your workouts\\n\\noutdoors and make use of equipment at your local playground, but you may not know how best to make a workout with it.\\n\\nWe know how to make a workout with it. If you thought body-weight training was just pushups\\n\\nand situps, these routines will open your eyes to the multitude of ways you can get ripped at those times when you feel as if you have no options at all.\\n\\nTHE BEST BODY-WEIGHT WORKOUT [option A] WORKOUT #18 BY ZACH EVEN-ESH\\n\\nIf y ou’v e ev er w ondered how guy s w ho w ork out exclusiv ely on\\n\\nmonkey bars in the park get so ripped, this w orkout is the answ er.

N ot only w ill y ou burn fat and build muscle w ith just\\n\\nthree exercises—y ou’ll learn one of the secrets street gy mnasts use to bang\\n\\nout dozens of reps of pullups and dips at a clip: the 10 to 1 method.\\n\\nHOW IT WORKS\\n\\nThe circuit w e’v e designed here doesn’t let up. When y ou train any squat\\n\\nv ariation, plus the pullup and the dip, y ou w ork nearly ev ery muscle in y our\\n\\nbody , and y our heart w ill race to supply them w ith blood and oxy gen.\\n\\nP erforming a decreasing number of reps—10 to 1—helps y ou keep the\\n\\nw orkout going despite being fatigued and builds the endurance that ultimately\\n\\nleads to being able to rattle off a high number of reps in one shot. In addition\\n\\nto getting y ou leaner, feel free to use this w orkout to w in bar bets about how\\n\\nmany pullups y ou can do.\\n\\nDIRECTIONS\\n\\nP erform the exercises as a circuit, completing a set of each in turn and resting\\n\\nas little as possible betw een sets. Repeat for 10 circuits (until y ou’re doing\\n\\nonly one rep per exercise).\\n\\n1 JUMP SQUAT\\n\\nREPS: 10 TO 1 REST: 0 SEC.\\n\\nStand with feet shoulder-width apart and squat down about halfway. Jump as high as you can. Land with soft knees and begin the next rep. Perform 10 reps. Each time you repeat the circuit, perform one less rep. So the next round you’ll do 9 reps, then 8, and so on down to 1 rep.\\n\\n2 PULLUP\\n\\nREPS: 10 TO 1 REST: 0 SEC.\\n\\nHang from a pullup bar, jungle gym, or tree limb and pull yourself up until your chin is higher than your hands.

This w orkout is outside the box\\n\\n—so much so, in fact, that y ou’ll hav e to go outdoors to do it.\\n\\nHOW IT WORKS\\n\\nThis routine requires a park or play ground area w ith monkey bars and plenty\\n\\nof open space. You’ll use classic, though under-prescribed, body -w eight\\n\\nexercises like the bear craw l and crab w alk, w hich y ou probably hav en’t tried\\n\\nsince y our day s in summer camp. A s y ou’ll come to remember, they ’re not\\n\\neasy —especially for a grow n man w ell north of 100 pounds. They require a\\n\\nlot of w ork from y our heart, lungs, and core. Later, the parallel bar hand w alk\\n\\nw ill blow up y our grip and forearms; the sprints w ill fry y our legs.\\n\\nDIRECTIONS\\n\\nP erform the exercise pairs (marked “A ” and “B”) as supersets, so y ou’ll\\n\\ncomplete one set of A and then one set of B before resting. Repeat until all\\n\\nsets are complete. N ote that the parallel bar hand w alk is done as straight sets\\n\\n—do a set, rest, and repeat.\\n\\nThis workout combines well with Body-Weight option A,\\n\\nso if you want to integrate them both into a training week, perform A first, rest a day, and then perform B.

If a barbell is all y ou hav e\\n\\nto train w ith, w e’ll assume that y ou don’t hav e a lot of w eight at y our\\n\\ndisposal any w ay , so this w orkout is a minimalist’s dream.\\n\\nHOW IT WORKS\\n\\nThe P oundstone curl is simply a barbell curl done w ith the empty bar alone—\\n\\nfor an enormous number of reps (in this case, w e prescribe 100). It’s named\\n\\nafter professional strongman Derek P oundstone, w ho, despite being 350\\n\\npounds w ith biceps like footballs, still sw ears by this deceptiv ely hard\\n\\nexercise.

By getting the lats involved, you incorporate strong stabilizing muscles that will let you go a little heavier on the triceps extensions—even if all the weight you have left to add is a couple of 2.5-pound plates.\\n\\nDIRECTIONS\\n\\nP erform all the sets for the first exercise before mov ing on to the second.\\n\\n1 POUNDSTONE CURL\\n\\nSETS: A S MA NY A S NEEDED REPS: 100 TOTA L REST: A S NEEDED\\n\\nGrasp the barbell at shoulder width.

The kind of w hole-body training y ou\\n\\ncan perform on a suspension sy stem is as efficient as it is effectiv e, and\\n\\nstudies hav e show n that compound mov ements release more muscle-building\\n\\nhormones than do isolation mov es. While the follow ing w orkout seems to\\n\\ntarget y our entire upper body , the stress it places on y our arms in particular\\n\\nw ill get them looking as good as if they w ere trained w ith isolation\\n\\nmov ements.\\n\\nHOW IT WORKS\\n\\nThe w orkout starts w ith pushups and row s. It w ill hit the chest, shoulders,\\n\\nand back, too, of course; but it w on’t shortchange y our biceps and triceps. In\\n\\nfact, ev en though y ou’re not w orking them in isolation, the bi’s and tri’s w ill\\n\\nkick in harder because they ’re lifting more of y our w eight than they could if\\n\\ny ou w ere doing simple curls or extensions. N ev ertheless, there’s a place for\\n\\nthese mov ements, too—right after the compound lifts, w hen y ou’re looking to\\n\\nfinish the arms off w ith more direct stimulation.\\n\\nDIRECTIONS\\n\\nP erform the exercise pairs (marked “A ” and “B”) as alternating sets.

(You can lower the handles over time to make the set harder, and later, elevate your feet; shorten the straps to make it easier.) Grasp the handles and get into pushup position with hands under your shoulders. Your entire body should be straight and your core braced. Lower your body until your chest is between the handles.\\n\\n1B ROTATIONAL INVERTED ROW\\n\\nSETS: 4 REPS: 10–12 REST: 60 SEC.\\n\\nHold the handles and lean back with arms extended so that your body is supported by the trainer and only your feet are on the floor. Brace your core and hold your body in a straight line. (The lower you set the handles, the harder the exercise; you can elevate your feet to make it even harder.) Start with your palms facing your feet, and as you row your body up, twist your wrists outward so that your palms face up in the top position.\\n\\n2A TRICEPS EXTENSION\\n\\nSETS: 4 REPS: 10 REST: 60 SEC.\\n\\nLengthen the straps and stand underneath the trainer’s anchor point. Lean your weight forward and bend your elbows so you feel a stretch in your triceps. Your palms should face each other behind your head. Keeping your body straight and your abs braced, extend your elbows, rotating your palms so they face down in the extended position.\\n\\n2B BICEPS CURL\\n\\nSETS: 4 REPS: 10 REST: 60 SEC.\\n\\nFace the trainer’s attachment point and grasp the handles with palms facing up. Lean back with your abs braced, body straight, and arms extended in front of you.

Take five seconds to lower yourself down to the hang position. That’s one rep.\\n\\n13 BICEPS\\n\\nWhen you first start training, an equal amount of arm work for the biceps and triceps is enough to stimulate even gains. But down the line, one muscle always seems to develop ahead of the other and you end up needing to give the weaker one greater attention. If it’s your biceps, you’re about to learn a bevy of new curls that will peak your peaks fast and for a long time to come.\\n\\nTHE BEST FULL-GYM BICEPS WORKOUT WORKOUT #27 BY HARRY CLAY\\n\\nWhen y ou’v e got total gy m access y ou need to take adv antage of it.\\n\\nH ow ev er, for the more zealous among us, there is a risk of\\n\\nov ertraining smaller body parts—like biceps—in an attempt to sample all of a\\n\\ngy m’s w ares.

Keep your weight on your heels and lean forward slightly. Without letting your upper arms drift forward, curl the weights, rotating your wrists outward so that your palms face you in the top position. Hold the top for a moment and squeeze your biceps. Lower the weights back down and flex your triceps hard in the bottom position (your arms should end up slightly behind your body). Increase the weight gradually each set.\\n\\n2 DRAG CURL\\n\\nSETS: 4 REPS: 12–15 REST: 60 SEC.\\n\\nPerform as you would the conventional dumbbell curl, but stand tall and drive your elbows back as you curl so the head of each dumbbell touches the front of your body throughout the rep.

MURPHY, M.F.S.\\n\\nIt w as once thought that the pump w as just a cosmetic side effect of\\n\\nlifting w eights, but it’s actually an integral part of the muscle-building\\n\\nprocess. P erforming reps creates tension in the muscles that, to some degree,\\n\\npinches off the v eins that take blood out of them w hile the arteries that\\n\\ndeliv er blood to the muscles continue unobstructed. S o the muscles fill up w ith\\n\\nblood faster than they can be cleared of it. This “cell sw elling” stretches the\\n\\nmuscle cell membranes, sending the body the message that the muscles aren’t\\n\\nbig enough to handle the blood flow to them.\\n\\nBands create enormous tension throughout a muscle’s\\n\\nentire range of motion, and yet the tension is easily adjusted depending on how you stand or position your body. This makes them great tools for pumping up your biceps.\\n\\nH O W IT WO RKS The w orkout is designed for use w ith tw o or more bands,\\n\\nbut if y ou hav e only one, y ou can perform any of the curls one arm at a\\n\\ntime.

The truth is that the triceps make up most of the upper arm (two- thirds, in fact), and while they’re not as much fun to practice posing in the mirror as their neighbors to the north, they account for more impressive pipes when fully developed.\\n\\nBigger, stronger triceps also play a key role in bench pressing and assist on back exercises, so if you want to get your arm-training priorities straight, start with this chapter.\\n\\nTHE BEST FULL-GYM TRICEPS WORKOUT WORKOUT #31 BY JIM SMITH, C.S.C.S.\\n\\nBecause the triceps are bigger muscles than the biceps, they can take\\n\\nmore of a pounding and respond w ell to both heav y w eight and high\\n\\nreps.

Take a gamble on this approach and y ou’ll see y our\\n\\ntriceps grow .\\n\\nH O W IT WO RKS A ll y ou need is y our ow n body w eight and a deck of cards.\\n\\nYou’ll let the deck determine the number of reps y ou perform for the diamond\\n\\npushup—the best pushup v ariation for targeting the triceps. It may seem\\n\\nrandom, but y ou’ll end up getting plenty of pushups done, and w hen y ou\\n\\ndon’t hav e w eights to apply a more strenuous load to y our muscles, giv ing\\n\\nthem a high v olume of w ork is the only w ay to induce enough muscle\\n\\ndamage to result in grow th.

Place the cards facedown. The numbers on the cards will be the number of reps you’ll perform—face cards count as 10, and aces may be wild but no less than 10. Flip a card in one pile and perform the number of reps it calls for. Rest 20 seconds and then flip another card. Continue until you’ve completed that stack and then rest two minutes. Repeat the process with the remaining two stacks. To perform the diamond pushup, get into pushup position with your hands close together so that your index fingers and thumbs touch and form a diamond shape. Keeping your abs braced and torso in line with your hips, lower your body until your chest nearly touches the floor.\\n\\n2 TRICEPS EXTENSION\\n\\nSETS: A S MA NY A S NEEDED REPS: 100 TOTA L REST: 60 SEC.\\n\\nUse an elevated surface that’s about waist height and can support your weight, such as a windowsill. Place your hands on it at shoulder width and let it support your weight, with your torso and hips in line and abs braced. Bend your elbows to lower your head beneath the object until you feel a stretch on your triceps. Now extend your elbows to come back up. Perform 100 total reps, taking as many sets as needed to hit that number.\\n\\n3 HALF DIP\\n\\nSETS: 5 REPS: A S MA NY A S POSSIBLE REST: 60 SEC.\\n\\nPlace your palms on a bench or chair and extend your legs in front of you. Lower your body halfway to the floor and then extend your elbows to come up. Try to explode upward on each rep.\\n\\n15 FOREARMS\\n\\nDirect forearm training is usually performed at the end of an upper-body or arm workout, but there’s no reason you can’t give them their own day if you want. In addition to the workouts we’ve provide here, there are some other steps you can take to bolster your forearm gains. Avoid using wrist straps on your back exercises, especially the deadlift. The harder you can squeeze your hands around a bar—and the heavier that bar is—the more forearm muscle you’ll activate.\\n\\nTHE BEST FULL-GYM FOREARM WORKOUT WORKOUT #36 BY MARTIN ROONEY\\n\\nA gy m tow el can be used for more than soaking up sw eat and\\n\\nprotecting y our modesty in the locker room.

We’v e got a third to add\\n\\nto the mix, and this three-pronged attack can build shoulders as round and\\n\\ndense as cannonballs.\\n\\nH O W IT WO RKS The first exercise, a neutral-grip ov erhead press, is the\\n\\nsafest w ay to do any pressing mov ement. If y ou’v e backed off of shoulder\\n\\nw ork in the past because it hurt to execute, relief can be as simple as turning\\n\\ny our palms to face each other. In this position, y our upper-arm bones can\\n\\nglide through the shoulder joints w ithout risk of impingement.\\n\\nYou’ll follow this up with a variety of shoulder raises, ending with a crucifix hold, in which you keep your arms raised for time. This is an exercise popular among strongman competitors, whose shoulders are the size of pumpkins. Finally, the workout ends with seated dumbbell cleans. If you’ve ever done power cleans, you know what exploding a weight up from the floor to shoulder level can do for your shoulders, and this variation isolates them\\n\\nmore. It’s as simple to do as it sounds: heave the weights up. Brute force builds big shoulders.\\n\\nDIRE C TIO N S C omplete all sets for one exercise before mov ing on to the\\n\\nnext.\\n\\n1 NEUTRAL-GRIP OVERHEAD PRESS\\n\\nSETS: 5 REPS: 8 REST: 60 SEC.\\n\\nHold a dumbbell in each hand at shoulder level with palms facing each other and elbows pointing forward.

Allow the momentum to flip your wrists so you catch the weights at shoulder level.\\n\\n18 BACK\\n\\nGetting your mind into back training isn’t as easy as it is with the chest and arms. Because you can’t see your back, it is tougher to visualize how it is working, and so you must learn to focus on the feeling of your muscles contracting with each rep. Finding the right training implements for your needs can help with this. If dumbbells don’t work for you, bands might, because their accommodating resistance makes reps feel different than with free weights. It’s possible that simple pullups do the trick, because you’re able to imagine your hands as hooks designed to allow your lats to move your body up and down. Whatever may work best for you, we’ve got it covered here, so you can build your back with the same intensity you do your arms.\\n\\nTHE BEST FULL-GYM BACK WORKOUT WORKOUT #53 BY JIM SMITH, C.S.C.S.\\n\\nDeadlifts are one of our fav orite exercises at M en’s F itness.

Keeping your back flat, extend your hips to stand up, pulling the bar up along your legs to lockout. Perform three warmup sets of five reps using 20%, 40%, and 60% of your deadlift max, respectively. (If you don’t know how much you can lift for one rep on the deadlift, estimate it conservatively.) Rest 90 seconds between these warmups. When you’re done, perform one set with 70–75% of your max for five reps and then rest 15 seconds. Perform three more sets of as many reps as possible, resting 15 seconds between sets.

Grasp the handles with palms facing you and hang. Now pull yourself up until your chin is over your hands. Begin to lower yourself, moving your elbows away from your body and rotating your palms to face forward. Do it slowly (it should take three to five seconds to come back down). That’s one rep.\\n\\n2 INVERTED ROW\\n\\nSETS: SEE BELOW REPS: 75 TOTA L REST: A S NEEDED\\n\\nLengthen the straps and hold the handles. Lean back with arms extended so that your body is supported by the trainer and only your feet are on the floor. Brace your core and hold your body in a straight line. (The lower you set the handles, the harder the exercise; you can elevate your feet on something to make it even harder.) With palms facing your feet, row your body up. Perform 75 total reps, resting as needed.

Allow your arms to extend in front of you. Squeeze your shoulder blades together and draw your arms back until they’re 90 degrees out to your sides. (Keep a slight bend in your elbows.) That’s one rep of the reverse flye. Perform five reps. Now, from the start position of the reverse flye, draw your upper arms back with your elbows bent 90 degrees and knuckles facing the ceiling. Your upper body should make a W shape. That’s one rep of the external rotation. Perform five reps. Return to the starting position with arms extended and pull your hands to your forehead, twisting your palms to face in front of you as you pull. That’s one face pull. Perform five reps.

The trick is to keep the circuit going, switching to exercises that are just easy enough to let you continue doing reps. Unlike with weights, dropsets based on mechanical advantage allow you to keep the same load— your body—which ensures your lats get the greatest possible stimulus.\\n\\nDIRE C TIO N S P erform the exercises as a circuit, completing one set of each\\n\\nin sequence w ithout rest.

Because they’re enormous muscles, working the legs causes greaterrelease of natural anabolic hormones than any other body part. This contributes to the growth of all your muscles over time. And if you’re interested in playing sports, running, and preventing a hip fracture when you’re an old man, you’ll want to train legs now.\\n\\nThe following workouts cover a broad range of\\n\\napproaches to leg training, with at least one guaranteed to meet your requirements.

Eventually, every guy has to work his calves, even if it’s only during the few months leading up to summer. We don’t blame you for skipping them—even great trainers fail to program calf work into workouts because they don’t contribute to overall size, strength, and athleticism like the other muscles do. But that doesn’t mean they can’t bring your whole physique down if they’re stringy.\\n\\nThese routines bring the calves up fast. So if you have the patience to work them only in the late spring, that’s all you’ll need.\\n\\nTHE BEST FULL-GYM CALF WORKOUT WORKOUT #63 BY SEAN HYSON, C.S.C.S.\\n\\nDon’t ov erlook y our calv es—they ’re key to a complete phy sique.\\n\\nP lus, w hile today ’s shorts and bathing suits do a good job hiding y our\\n\\nthighs, y our calv es w ill alw ay s be on display during w armer months (that is,\\n\\nunless y ou refuse to w ear shorts because of y our calv es).\\n\\nThis routine is grounded in progressive overload, the\\n\\nfirst rule of weight training, which means gradually increasing the reps, sets, or weights you use and thereby forcing your muscles to continually adapt by growing bigger and stronger.

Give some of these\\n\\nworkouts a go and see if all your lifts don’t improve as a result.

Keeping your lower back in its natural arch, push your hips forward to raise the bar to lockout. To begin each subsequent rep, push your hips back and lower the bar to mid-shin level.

Having a thick neck and traps that reach to your ears (collectively called “the yoke”) is the hallmark of defensive linemen, wrestlers, bouncers, and other badasses who clearly don’t work out just to look pretty. A guy who’s yoked looks like he can handle business.\\n\\nGetting that look isn’t as hard as you might think, but you will need either a barbell or dumbbells.

Instead, we split up our body into parts that we train on different days; hence the term “split routine.” Yet there exists another way—to train the entire upper body one day and the lower half another—and there are several advantages to it.\\n\\nWorking the whole upper body one day allows you to\\n\\ncome back a few days later and work it again. Say you normally train your chest once every five days. You could hit it twice in three days, doubling the muscle-building stimulus simply by switching from body-part workouts to an upper-body split.\\n\\nUpper-body splits are also ideal for strength building,\\n\\nallowing you to focus workouts around a main lift and then working all the muscles that play a part in making that lift stronger.\\n\\nThe upper-body workouts we’ve included here pair up\\n\\nwell with the lower-body routines that follow them, something to consider if you’re looking for a complete program.\\n\\nTHE BEST UPPER-BODY WORKOUT [option A] WORKOUT #80 BY C.J.

Do not perform this workout more than twice a week, and allow at least three days before repeating.\\n\\nWhen you use the 25-rep rule on the squat, spend the\\n\\nfirst three or four sets warming up so that only the last two are done with the heaviest weights possible.\\n\\nFor the remaining exercises, choose a weight that allows\\n\\nyou 10–12 reps in your first set and perform three sets with it, getting as many reps as possible. Rest 60 seconds between sets. Set a timer before you begin. Afterward,\\n\\ncount up all your reps and note the time. The next time you repeat the workout, try to beat that number of reps or your time. Do not add weight to an exercise until you can beat your last performance.\\n\\n1 SQUAT\\n\\nSETS: 5 REPS: 5 REST: 90–120 SEC.\\n\\nSet up in a squat rack or cage. Grasp the bar as far apart as is comfortable and step under it. Squeeze your shoulder blades together and nudge the bar out of the rack. Step back and stand with your feet shoulder width and your toes turned slightly outward. Take a deep breath and bend your hips back, then bend your knees to lower your body as far as you can without losing the arch in your lower back. Push your knees outward as you descend. Extend your hips to come back up, continuing to push your knees outward.\\n\\n2 WALKING LUNGE\\n\\nSETS: 3 REPS: SEE DIRECTIONS (EA CH SIDE) REST: 60 SEC.\\n\\nStand with your feet hip width, holding a dumbbell in each hand.

Now set up in a squat rack or cage. Grasp the bar as far apart as is comfortable and step under it. Squeeze your shoulder blades together and nudge the bar out of the rack. Step back and stand with your feet shoulder width and your toes turned slightly outward. Take a deep breath and bend your hips back and then bend your knees to lower your body until you’re on the box. Pause for a moment but don’t relax, and then extend your hips to come back up. Perform several warmup sets, keeping your reps to five or fewer. Gradually work up to the heaviest weight that you can perform three reps with (this should take at least five sets). Refer back to chapter 2 for instructions on how to work up appropriately. Be sure to use a spotter or perform your sets in a power rack with spotter bars in place.\\n\\n2 1½ BULGARIAN SPLIT SQUAT\\n\\nSETS: 3 REPS: 8 × 1½ REPS (EA CH SIDE) REST: 180 SEC.\\n\\nStand lunge-length in front of a bench. Hold a dumbbell in each hand and rest the top of your right foot on the bench behind you. Lower your body until your rear knee nearly touches the floor and your front thigh is parallel. Come back up halfway and then lower to the floor again. Now come all the way up. That’s one “1½ rep.”\\n\\n3A WEIGHTED BACK EXTENSION\\n\\nSETS: 4 REPS: 12 REST: 0 SEC.\\n\\nLock your legs into a back extension bench and hold a weight plate against the back of your head. Allow your torso to bend forward so that your hips are bent almost 90 degrees, but do not lose the arch in your lower back. Extend your hips so that your body forms a straight line.\\n\\n3B DUMBBELL SIDE BEND\\n\\nSETS: 4 REPS: 12 (EA CH SIDE) REST: 90 SEC.\\n\\nHold a dumbbell at your side with one hand, palm facing in. Bend your torso to that side as far as you can, allowing the weight to pull you down. Do not let your body twist so that you bend forward.\\n\\n4 SPRINTER SITUP\\n\\nSETS: 3 REPS: 15 (EA CH SIDE) REST: 60 SEC.\\n\\nLie on your back and extend your legs. Bend your right hip and knee 90 degrees while you perform a situp, swinging your left arm forward and right arm back. Repeat on the opposite side. Perform the reps rhythmically so the motion looks like you’re sprinting.\\n\\n26 CARDIO MACHINES\\n\\nMachines aren’t often the best choice for building muscle, but they work just fine for getting your heart rate up and keeping it there.

Your\\n\\nw ork interv al (WI) w ill be 85% of that number, and y our rest interv al (RI)\\n\\nw ill be 55% .\\n\\nFor example, a 30-year-old man will keep his heart rate at 160 beats per minute during the work interval and then reduce his effort to around 100 beats per minute for the rest interval. Note that the rest interval does not mean\\n\\ncomplete rest, but a very easy pace. If you don’t have a heart rate monitor, you can estimate your heart rate by putting your index and middle fingers to your carotid artery (to the left of your throat) and counting the beats in your pulse for six seconds.

(So, a 30-year-old would have an approximate MHR of 190 beats per minute.) The high-intensity work sets call for a heart rate that’s 85–95% of your maximum; so, a 30-year- old will keep his heart rate between 160 and 180 beats per minute during that time.\\n\\nNote that the rest interval does not mean complete rest, but a very easy pace. If you don’t have a heart rate monitor, you can estimate your heart rate by putting your index and middle fingers on your carotid artery (to the left of your throat) and counting the beats in your pulse for six seconds.

Jason F erruggia, designer of this w orkout\\n\\nand a longtime training adv iser to M en’s F itness, is a huge fan of legendary\\n\\nN F L running back Walter P ay ton. H e likes to point out that P ay ton, w ho w as\\n\\nperpetually ripped and know n for his durability , made hill sprints a cornerstone\\n\\nof his w orkouts throughout his career.\\n\\nDo the same, and your pick-up game buddies may be\\n\\ncalling you “Sweetness,” or, at least, not “Slowness.”\\n\\nH O W IT WO RKS S printing is intense exercise and can beat up y our low er\\n\\nbody if y ou don’t ease into it. That’s w hy w e recommend doing it on a hill\\n\\nlike P ay ton did, w hich w ill slow y ou dow n a bit so that y ou’re less likely to\\n\\npull a hamstring, quad, or hip flexor.

Run at slightly less than your absolute top speed for safety. Rest as needed between sets, but keep your heart rate elevated. Allow yourself enough recovery that you can go fast. If you’re new to sprinting or haven’t done it in a while, do your sprints on a hill. Start with five and run only at a moderate pace and build up from there. Land on the balls of your feet as you sprint, not your heels. Your front foot should land directly beneath you (unless the hill is especially steep). Your arms should pump vigorously forward and backward as you run. Let your hands come up to face level and then back to your pockets, but no further. Keep your shoulders and hips level so there’s no side-to-side rotation in your torso.\\n\\n29 BOXING & MMA\\n\\nEvery guy wants to look like a fighter, before a fight, that is.

      "page_content='Incentives are a great way to stay on track as you reach milestones. They can range from\\n\\nscheduling a massage, buying a new outfit, or even new exercise gear.\\n\\n7. Progress not perfection. When you’re first starting out, you can get caught up in trying to do everything\\n\\nperfectly, but sometimes this isn’t sustainable. Instead, focus on positive changes you’ve made; did you cut out your soft drink habit or are you taking the stairs rather than the lift? All of these positive health behaviours will help you reach your goal.\\n\\n8. Plan for failure. Let’s face it, life happens, and when it does it’s best to be prepared. Put out your clothes the\\n\\nnight before, pack a healthy lunch, and schedule in your exercise time so you can plan out your week.\\n\\n9. Action, action, action!
